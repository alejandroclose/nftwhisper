But once every thousand years, it spreads its wings on a large pile of firewood and sings, and when it is excited by its song, it lights a fire with its beak, and by burning in the fire from its ashes, another phoenix is ​​born.\nIn many cultures, the phoenix is ​​considered a symbol of immortality, sacrifice and long life.\n\nIn this work, I tried to create bird-like shapes that are being formed and created by using a grid in the form of noise and with the shape of rectangles that have random length and width and get their color from the palettes. You can clearly see the wings or the bird's head in most of the exits\nIn fact, my idea is to depict the moment of resurrection and rebirth of the phoenix from the heart of the ashes, which rises to the sky.\nthe ash particles around this reborn bird are being scattered in the air and finally from At the heart of this re-creation, a beautiful and glorious phoenix comes into existence.\n\nMade by p5.js",

But once every thousand years, it spreads its wings on a large pile of firewood and sings, and when it is excited by its song, it lights a fire with its beak, and by burning in the fire from its ashes, another phoenix is ​​born.\nIn many cultures, the phoenix is ​​considered a symbol of immortality, sacrifice and long life.\n\nIn this work, I tried to create bird-like shapes that are being formed and created by using a grid in the form of noise and with the shape of rectangles that have random length and width and get their color from the palettes. You can clearly see the wings or the bird's head in most of the exits\nIn fact, my idea is to depict the moment of resurrection and rebirth of the phoenix from the heart of the ashes, which rises to the sky.\nthe ash particles around this reborn bird are being scattered in the air and finally from At the heart of this re-creation, a beautiful and glorious phoenix comes into existence.\n\nMade by p5.js",

            "description": "640 unique sketches of imaginary walls, inspired by the work of Norwegian architect Erling Viksjø (1910–1971) and his artist collaborators. Viksjø designed the Government Quarter in Oslo and invited artists from different disciplines to help design the facades and interiors of the buildings.\n\nViksjø’s aim was to “soften” modernist architecture. He invented «Natural Concrete», a type of concrete that deliberately exposes the mixed-in stones on its surface to give it warmth and a human touch. In my work, I have similar ambitions—using code instead of concrete.\n\nThe different styles of the piece are inspired by, and dedicated to some of the artists who worked together with Viksjø: Jakob Weidemann (~2%), Carl Nesjar (~18%), Odd Tandberg (~30%), and Tore Haaland (~50%).\n\nIn live mode, press ‘S’ to save an image at current resolution or ‘P’ to save a high-resolution file at 6000×6000px (this might take a while depending on your hardware).\n\nOriginal artwork by Andreas Rau · Made with p5.js & glsl · Oslo, 2021",

            "description": "This is a journey through architecture that never existed.\n\nInspired by the grammatical rules behind French sacral architecture of the Middle Ages, this generative tool is meant for creating a collection of 256 plans of fictional buildings. Each plan is a unique variation on semantic relations between architectural elements: from a regular composition resembling existing churches to a dynamic aggregation of vaults, columns and chevets. But always following the same set of rules extracted from multiple examples of gothic cathedrals.\n\nEvery church has its place and time in which it could have been built in an alternative series of historical events.\n\nThis artistic tribute to the research of Stiny and Mitchell about Palladian architecture or Duarte's work about Siza takes the topic of formalizing architectural language onto a lighthearted level by moving it to a slightly imaginary world.\n\nTo zoom, press a mouse button when over the image or touch the screen.

But once every thousand years, it spreads its wings on a large pile of firewood and sings, and when it is excited by its song, it lights a fire with its beak, and by burning in the fire from its ashes, another phoenix is ​​born.\nIn many cultures, the phoenix is ​​considered a symbol of immortality, sacrifice and long life.\n\nIn this work, I tried to create bird-like shapes that are being formed and created by using a grid in the form of noise and with the shape of rectangles that have random length and width and get their color from the palettes. You can clearly see the wings or the bird's head in most of the exits\nIn fact, my idea is to depict the moment of resurrection and rebirth of the phoenix from the heart of the ashes, which rises to the sky.\nthe ash particles around this reborn bird are being scattered in the air and finally from At the heart of this re-creation, a beautiful and glorious phoenix comes into existence.\n\nMade by p5.js",
