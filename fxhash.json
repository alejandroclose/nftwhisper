            "description": "The idea of living within close proximity to nature has enticed people for centuries, especially for the ones used to living in bustling cities. Just picturing a cozy resort in the countryside, or playing music that resembles the feelings of holiday-making can drive us to go on a well-deserved vacation. Even when we don’t know where to, or whether we have the time or resources to slip out of our busy days, or even if that destination exists only in our imaginations. But when we do entertain ourselves with such ideas, we feel like we have taken a step to heal ourselves or to give our mind a worthy time out.\n\nOn the other hand, we have been living in human-focused settlements like cities for around 10,000 years, and we have all we need in an urban landscape, yet the idea of living in a secluded resort close to nature kept inviting us. This begs the question: were we supposed to live adjacent to nature to live well? Is it in our nature that we are wired to go back to the world beyond our doors? Or was it because we are aware of how big nature is, and how little time and resources we have to explore them all?\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Dec22",

            "description": "The idea of living within close proximity to nature has enticed people for centuries, especially for the ones used to living in bustling cities. Just picturing a cozy resort in the countryside, or playing music that resembles the feelings of holiday-making can drive us to go on a well-deserved vacation. Even when we don’t know where to, or whether we have the time or resources to slip out of our busy days, or even if that destination exists only in our imaginations. But when we do entertain ourselves with such ideas, we feel like we have taken a step to heal ourselves or to give our mind a worthy time out.\n\nOn the other hand, we have been living in human-focused settlements like cities for around 10,000 years, and we have all we need in an urban landscape, yet the idea of living in a secluded resort close to nature kept inviting us. This begs the question: were we supposed to live adjacent to nature to live well? Is it in our nature that we are wired to go back to the world beyond our doors? Or was it because we are aware of how big nature is, and how little time and resources we have to explore them all?\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Dec22",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free.

            "description": "\"Stepping Stones\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Performance in Code: Deciphering Value in Generative Art, Art Basel Miami Beach, 2022\n\nStepping Stones explores the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Simple patterns, shapes, textures, and colors are arranged in randomly selected ways. Overlaying shapes distort and blend, breaking these objects apart and causing complex forms to emerge. Combining these individual features together results in varying outcomes, from surprisingly simple to wildly chaotic.\n\n---------------\n\nControls:\nPress 1-6 to change the scale of the canvas (1 = default, 2500px x 2500px, 6 = 15,000px x 15,000px)\nS (or double tap on mobile): Save output at current size\nC: Toggle cutout shapes visibility\nH: Toggle cutout outlines visibility\nB: Iterate border sizes (none, default, 1.5x, 2x, 3x)\nT: Toggle texture visibility\nF: Toggle fullscreen\nAdd the url params x and y to set custom dimensions. For example, add &x=1500&y=500 for a 1500px x 500px image\n\n---------------\n\nTyler Boswell (@teaboswell) 2022\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0, See bundle.js.LICENSE.txt for third party license information",

            "description": "Everything is divisible. Larger organisms are made up of smaller ones, entire galaxies are comprised of stars, planets, people, dust, and one effect here and now ripples into eternity. Nothing exists without the elemental components that have evolved to make them possible — and nothing on the plane of existence arrives in isolation from something greater. This enmeshed reality is the concept of a Holon: a whole that is simultaneously part of another whole. \n\nAs cells, energies, beings, and ideas grow in complexity, each new advancement includes and transcends their holons, the very catalysts of evolution. What does this essential process look like on its own when scale, context, and definition are removed? The senses are forced to purely observe the present interactions and reactions that occur between all parts. This is what Holons attempts to portray — the witnessing of birth, formation, and crystallization simultaneously. \n\nUpon viewing each piece and inspecting its detail with curiosity — we can observe living reality that has been temporarily suspended from motion and artificially stopped for us to witness. Can we see what is a part, and what is a whole? Can we define what these holons are? \n\nLet each Holons remind us that the impossible can always be made; let each one be nothing and everything — organisms, cosmos, energy itself — all at once, for it’s the creation of something entirely new that best reminds us that everything is actually made of the parts already here. So, remember to create without barriers or limitations because reality itself is made of that which lives now only in imagination.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x flight404\nOctober 2022\n\nPress ‘h’ in live view to render a high resolution version of any token.\nPress ‘s’ in live view to save a .png of the current view of any token.\n\nHolons was created in vanilla Javascript and WebGL, but the majority of the work was done in GLSL shaders. This setup was substantially assisted by fx(hash) community leader and artist Liam Egan who provided technical assistance and emotional support during the project's lifespan. For this reason, we have included him in the split of proceeds.\n",
