This serves as a symbol of cleansing the mind and returning to primal simplicity.\nThis piece, instead of being filled with colors and patterns, speaks through its emptiness. Colorless spaces allow pure connections with forms and textures, revealing beauty in absence.\nBy emphasizing the concept of 'Lost Spaces,' this work delves into parts of our being that are usually overlooked. 'Lost Spaces' reminds us of the opportunities that lie within absence or imperfection. This canvas creates a space where emptiness is not seen as a lack but as an open realm for creativity, reflection, and new possibilities. Each line and color gently speak from their empty spaces, reminding us that even in absence and void, there is inherent meaning and beauty.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",
