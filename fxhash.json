            "description": "Description of Seasons of Siskiyou Series\n\nSurrounding my home, covering more than one million acres, is the Rogue River - Siskiyou National Forest which takes up three southern Oregon counties and one northern California county. It’s a magical place that fills the imagination and lifts the spirit; a place that inspires with its uniqueness, its legends, and its larger-than-life vistas.\n\nEach season in the Siskiyou mountains is a unique experience unto itself. So, with an attention to the feelings this place evokes at any given time of the year, I designed four generative tokens to create an impression of the emotion–the calming quietness; the peaceful solitude; the overwhelming contrasts and variety of forms, shapes and textures; the magic and playful mystery; the welcomingness and foreboding. These four works feature clever and inventive creative coding techniques in a rich, graphic style to craft a stunning impression of the Seasons of Siskiyou.\n\nToken 3 of 4 - THE FESTIVAL OF FALL (1990 x 1080) p5js Generative Token.\nThe days are getting shorter, and the nights cooler.  The playfulness of summer gives way to the season of harvests.  Dancing in a shower of colorful leaves, you enjoy a playful adventure involving pirate ships and cowboy hideouts;  a journey of imagination realized in the child-sized solitude of a rustic tree house.  As fleeting as a season is, the festival of fall will soon conclude when the magic of change sweeps away the color to take on the weight of winter.\n\nThe Festival of Fall celebrates the waning beauty of growth and renewal with falling, colorful leaves, golden bushes, distant mountains, and a beautiful recursive tree framing a cozy clubhouse.  A weathered, broken fence; a half-hearted refrain surrounding a nascent place, is lined by piles of leaves.  Dense, stands of tall grass give tell of the ripeness of the year with their golden hues.  Glints of light diffuse in the fluttering orbs of bluzzy motes that glide whimsically throughout the scene.\n\nOutput and Coding Feature of “The Festival of Fall”:\n\nThe Festival of Fall features a gorgeous recursive tree drawn with a pointillism style.  An overcast sky with a generative cloud-effect; animated leaves fall in capricious patterns; recursive bushes and a generative fence; a dust-mote-like optical effect; and random mountains.\n\nPress the DOWN ARROW to save a frame as a png image file. \nPress the LEFT ARROW to toggle the animation on/off.\n\nEach iteration changes the position of bushes, shape of mountains, trees, and alters features of the clubhouse, leaves and fence.  The animation toggle is given a random default state at start–so, some tokens will appear animated at first, while others will not.\n\nToken Published May 1, 2022 on FXHASH set at 75 Editions.\nWritten and designed by Ed Cavett using the p5js library.\nToken 3 of 4 from the series “The Seasons of Siskiyou.”",

            "description": "Fragments of minds\n\nOur daily life is filled with automatisms, habits that make our comfort zone. Then one day an event occurs that touches us deeply. We step out of our comfort zone, an internal emotional tornado is unleashed in our consciousness. This work tries to illustrate this flow of passion, this emotional violence on the fabric of daily life.\n\nAbout features.\nThere are 3 random characteristics:\n\n1. Latent state of mind\nThis feature correspond to the lines in the background. ‘Healthy’ is the most frequent, and the other types appear more rarely (’Psychotic’ is really rare).\n\n2. Crystallization\n\nThis feature corresponds to the strength of the flow of the passion in our mind. Probability : ‘Normal’ = 77%, ‘Strong’ = 33%.\n\n3. Disturbance\nThe disturbance rate is ’Low’ (frequent), or ‘High’ (rare).\n\nWhen a work is collected, a process of synchronicity is triggered. Synchronicity is a process of randomness that allows us to communicate with our unconscious (psychological paradigm) or with the hidden forces of the universe (spiritual paradigm). The rarer an image is, the more it represents an exceptional psychic state.\n\nTo print a high resolution image (resolution is 6400*6400px.), press [p].\nTo print a screen resolution image, right-clic then ‘save image’.\n\nThis artwork celebrate the anniversary of FxHash - Happy Birthday little baby :-)\n50% of primary sales are donate to the Processing Foundation (thank you for making my days better).\n\nArtwork by @GenerativePunk.",

Continuing the collab with my alternate identity HTMLCSS.TEZ\n\nThe practice of layering many graphic shapes and gradients with a chaotic mix of blending modes has been with me since my first years of photoshop in my youth. It's a familiar, friendly technique. Yet, I've rarely played with it outside photoshop. Here I take the opportunity to apply this abstract blending technique in a manner that alludes to reality: refracting crystals.\n\nThese generated crystals are not based in fact but imagination. They are illustrative of the magic and wonder some people associate with real life minerals and rocks. They blend together with impossible color changes only possible in the virtual.\n\nEach individual crystal element can be one of these blend modes (with chance):\ndifference (9/16), exclusion (2/16), hard-light (2/16), color-dodge (1/16), overlay (1/16), normal (1/16)\n\nControls:\nPlay/Pause - [Space]\nRotate - [Click + Drag]\nMove - [Shit + Click + Drag]\n\nMinter's Reward: 1/3 Secondary royalties",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch E. Rebuilding after the disruption of Sketch D. Color palettes from A-D remain and more palettes are introduced based on Werner's Nomenclature of Colors, first published in 1814, which served as a classification guide for natural colors before photography became commonplace and used by Charles Darwin during voyages on the HMS Beagle. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.\n\nPress the spacebar to see the framework and press the left/right arrow keys to construct and deconstruct.",

There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch E. Rebuilding after the disruption of Sketch D. Color palettes from A-D remain and more palettes are introduced based on Werner's Nomenclature of Colors, first published in 1814, which served as a classification guide for natural colors before photography became commonplace and used by Charles Darwin during voyages on the HMS Beagle.

This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch A starts very simple. It's the basic grid framework I intend to use for the series. It's just a simple grid with one colored square (usually). Colors are borrowed from Echos/Orbits. Grid size, padding, and line thickness vary.",
