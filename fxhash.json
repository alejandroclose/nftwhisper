            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

Butchers selling pork sausages, praise the product, the cavalry officer hand to hoop the woman selling kipper fish. In front of the barber house, the money changers, all the Athenian jaws around their table are talking, and Socrates passes from the agora. Everyone knows him\".\n Andre Boonard\n\nMy starting point in this collection is to make the audience feel a connection with an architectural composition I aimed. That's why firstly I created a composition, has a 360-degree view in the square of an ancient city. There are rules of the physical world; I designed it with elements such as atmosphere and movement, far-near relationship, texture. I aimed to strengthen the depth by using obelisks, stone walls, arches and icons from ancient objects in space composition.\n\nIt was published in my detailed article about this collection.\n\n* Each composition has its own unique 360-degree view.\nYou can activate the 360 ​​view by pressing the “Q” key.\n\n* 2d and 3d images of each composition have rain feature.\nYou can activate the rain mode by pressing the \"E\" key.\n\n* Save image: press 'W' to save the current image as png.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n* 15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.\n\n* According to my period, the owners of “Stratification of the Orthogonal”, “Agora of Timeless” and incoming project will have free mint rights of the next project.\n",

At every step, a copy of this seed is laid edge-to-edge adjacent to an existing shape, without causing any overlaps. This copy is colored based on the edge it shares with the existing shape. The process continues until the animation completes.\n\nNew shapes are placed closest to a moving target. In some mints, this target is slow moving, causing new shapes to expand radially from the seed. In other mints, this target races around, causing new shapes to chase it. \n\nEach of the 13 shapes forms different patterns under different circumstances. Not all patterns will be explored.\n\nControls:\n  - SPACE: Pause/unpause the animation.\n  - ENTER: Skip the animation.\n  - R: Restart the animation.\n\nURL Params:\n  - \"preview=1\": Skip the animation.\n  - \"flex=1\": Adapt the boundaries to the size of the window.\n  - “slow=1”: Draw only one shape per frame.\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

If you get a black screen you have surpassed what your graphics card can handle: press d + 0 to reset the pixel density. You can fine tune pressing d followed by + or - (+/- 0.5).\n* Save image: press 's' to save the current image as png. For a higher resolution png, 1st increase the resolution using 'd' and then save the image with 's'.\n* Tune image parameters: press 'z' (brightness), 'x' (contrast), 'g' (gamma), 'b' (blur) followed by + or - to adjust. Toggle tuning with 'a'. Press 'n' then + or - to adjust amount of noise.\n* Redraw: 'r' (changes how lines are drawn)\n\nIt is recommended to read the full instructions on the article.",

            "description": "A weaving draft serves as both instructions on how to set up a loom and how to weave a piece, and gives a preview of what the end result will look like.\n\nImprobable Drafts is a collection of weaving drafts that you'd probably never see. These drafts may contain errors, be too complicated to set up, produce undesirable, unusable, or even ugly results, or be an overly complicated means to an end. Or, maybe you'll end up with a draft that just makes sense - that's improbable itself!\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nEach draft has four components: threading (top left), tie-up (top right), treadling (bottom right), and draw down (bottom left).\n\nThe threading describes how your warp (vertical) yarns are positioned, and what colour each warp yarn is. Each row in the threading grid is a shaft, and each warp yarn is a column. A warp yarn can only be threaded through one shaft. The shafts control which yarns are raised or lowered, which, in combination with the weft (horizontal) yarn, form a pattern. A threading pattern is read from right to left, and the pattern continues for the desired width of piece.\n\nThe tie up determines which shafts are attached to which treadles. Treadles, operated by a weaver's feet, can lift one or more shafts - these control which shafts are in use, and allows for more than one to be at a time. There is one column for each treadle and one row for each shaft in the grid.\n\nThe treadling shows what order the treadles are pressed in, and therefore what order the shafts are raised in. When shafts are raised, the weft yarn is passed through. The treadling also shows which colour of weft yarn to use. The pattern is read from top to bottom, and repeats for the entire length of the weaving.\n\nFinally, the draw down puts all of these pieces together and shows a preview of what the woven piece will look like when combining the threading and treadling patterns, as well as the warp and weft yarn colours.\n\nThe threading, tie up, and treadling in this project are all ones commonly used in weaving, including tabby, twill, overshot, monk's belt, and more, with some improbable alterations. Every draft is possible to set up and weave, though niceness of results are not guaranteed.\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nMade in p5.js sharla, with a touch of p5.grain by meezwhite and gorilla sun. \n\nthank you, and happy weaving!",

There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

This can be toggled off by adding “&b=0” to the url.\nThe background scales with resolution to mimic a bigger canvas so it will look different at different resolutions.\nAt high resolutions a Moiré pattern may appear on the canvas background texture due to the way images are resized in the browser. It’s always recommended to download a full resolution version of the piece.\n\nBy KRANKARTA\nCreated on Firefox desktop 105.0 on 2022-11-11 in javascript and GLSL.\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

This work is yours too!\n\nKEYS\n- \"s\" : save image at current resolution\n- \"h\" : save image in hi-res (2875x4000px good for 4K display and A4 print)\n",
