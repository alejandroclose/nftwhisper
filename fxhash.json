            "description": "The universe is terrifyingly vast, mostly pitch-dark, save some billions of trillions of stars and planets. We are nothing. In all that vastness, we are the smallest fraction of time imaginable, floating around on a speck of dust. Yet somehow, we continue to work, learn, build relationships, create, and participate in all these other odd, uniquely human practices. It’s truly fascinating, when in the grand scheme, none of it seems consequential.\n\nAmara Celestial is an artistic representation of this intergalactic madness and the love for it. To expand on the project’s identity…Amara, my wife’s name, has many meanings. In her culture and family, it means “love” or “everlasting beauty”. Celestial most commonly refers to things not of this world, but from the sky, or space. The shapes, lines, and primary design of this project represent the unpredictable nature of the universe. The entire piece is stippled with thousands of points of various palette selected colors, to resemble the uncountable number of light sources in the great sea of space, as well as to provide textural depth.\n\nThe Features:\n- Canvas Style: Pretty simple, the canvas can be square (2048 x 2048), portrait (1352 X 2048) or landscape (2048 x 1352).\n- Palettes: There are 10 different palettes, each with equal chance of being randomly chosen. The palettes were heavily influenced by my wife. She is a woman of South American descent and loves the bright colors and contrast often seen in the traditional clothing and art of her culture. There are a few muted palettes, including a mono palette to mix things up!\n- Background Color: The background color can be black, white, or blue with varying rarity.\n- Background Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the background shape (if drawn).\n- Primary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the primary shape (i.e., the foremost shape).\n- Secondary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the secondary shape.\n- Posterize: This is a color limiting filter that can cause harsher (less smooth) changes in color. The lower the number, the more abrupt the changes (2 being the lowest allowed).\n- Primary Shape Centered: This is a true/false based on whether the primary shape is centered on the canvas.\n- Background override: This will override the selected background and replace it with vertical or horizontal lines, or prevent the background shape from being drawn entirely.\n\nOther randomness factors (non-features)\n- Stroke thickness on various shapes and points of the project.\n- Size of the overall shapes, as well as the size of the inner radius of the shapes.\n- Spacing between the stippling and lines (to keep it pattern-less).\n- Positioning of all the shapes (restricted to the canvas).\n- The number of iterations (rings) for each shape.",
