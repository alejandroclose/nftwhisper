            "description": "This is a bug-free version of the initial \"Infinity Loop\" (published on Sep. 2022). A NEON style colors, experimental repeated animation with inspiration elements from fireworks, laser and light shows.\n\nTechnically \"Infinity Loop\" is a programmatically generated abstract and geometric \"endless\" animation based on simple geometric shapes, lines and some text elements.\nEach generative token is a variation of a main animation prototype getting its identity of a set of random initial parameters specific to each token, as derived form the seed of the minting transaction hash.\n\nThe animation of each token spans in a period around 20 secs, so some features are not visible from the beginning nor in the (static) preview image. This is a pure algorithmic and randomly-driven process.\n\nTRAITS - FEATURES\nThe main traits are:\n\n- Mask Area: The clipping area (outer shape) of the token ('Rounded Rhombus', 'Circle', 'Rhombus)\n- Animated Shape: The main animated shape ('Circle', 'Box', 'Rectangle', 'Triangle', 'Polygon', 'Mixed')\n- Extra Animation: Some shapes have additional animation ('Yes', 'No')\n- Number of shapes: The number of Animated Shapes\n- Shape Size: 'Large' or 'Small'\n- Radial Distance: The distance of moving from the center of view ('Large', 'Small')\n- Curve Variation: The bezier - curve used (related mainly to orientation) (1 or 2)\n- Secondary Line Type: A Secondary line animated in background ('Horizontal', 'Diagonal 1', 'Diagonal 2', 'Diagonal 3')\n- Initial Hue: A basic color hue (1 to 360 in the HSB color model)\n- Border Color: The outer border color (unlimited values, in HEX format - True colors 16.7 millions colors)\n- Bubbles: Small decorative animated bubbles ('Yes', 'No')\n\nCONTROLS & INTERACTIVITY\nKEYS: \n   \n'1':   Save image (frame) with transparent background  \n'2':   Save image with colored background\n'UP ARROW': Increases the animation Speed (with one press to 150%)\n'DOWN ARROW': Decreases the animation Speed (to 50% of original)\n'R':  Reset speed to 100% (default)\n'SPACEBAR':  Toggle animation (start/stop)\n'H':  Toggle a help screen - dialog\n\nMOUSE:  \nCLICK or DRAG your mouse..\n\n----\nLIBRARY: p5js\n\n\n© 5/2023 (Initial released: 9/2022)  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "This experimental project involves an on-chain cellular automaton. The features and cellular automaton rules are derived from the minter's address. Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",

From wrinkles to lines and creases, the face is a storybook, revealing secrets and emotions that we try to overlook. A smile can light up a room, bringing joy to those nearby, while a frown can darken any space and cause one to ask why. The eyes are said to be the windows to the soul that lies within, revealing the truth and deepest secrets that we try to keep hidden. Whether it's love, anger, fear or sadness, our face will always express, the feelings we hold within us and the thoughts we repress. So take a moment and read the faces that you see, for they may hold a story that's waiting to be set free.\n_\n\nOpen / live mode / fullscreen view :\n* press [s] on keyboard to save or download in PNG format\n\n_\n\nGenerative visual, hybrid techniques, textures source created with AI (Stable Diffusion), combine with other elements that made with code / javascript, and layers transform in autonomous system on WebGL.\n\n_\n\nMore info & updates :\ntwitter.com/FMXAI_\nfmxai.tez.page",

            "description": "WARNING: Read instructions so you don’t get a broken token!!\n----\n\n\nQ: Why haven’t you tried fx(params)?\nA: Pff.. Sliders?\n\n\n“Pensado a mano” explores the intersection of Generative Art and Hand Drawing. The collector, by drawing a predefined number of shapes on canvas, creates a unique hand-crafted seed that generates the final artwork. That is the only customisable param, thought by hand, which interacts with various random attributes to produce a unique composition.\n\n“…the time we spend doing and making things, the process…”\n\nAnd yet the process continues. On the background, the code generates a plottable svg.\nAn artificially extended process, from hand to screen, from screen to paper, that creates a new kind of mixed media.\n\nSigned plots will soon be claimable via Artfora (tbd price + shipping)\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1 - Draw the requested shapes and wait to see the result. You can change the Seed Nr. slider if you don't like the selected mode.\n2 - Press “C” to copy drawing to Clipboard\n3 - Copy the clipboard contents to the text-input on the fx(params) sidebar\n\n***Important. If you buy several tickets, make sure you don't mint the same Seed Nr. twice (slider)\n\npress “S” to save the PNG, press “P” to plot the SVG\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis is a high-supply token minted during a bear market. Have Fun.",
