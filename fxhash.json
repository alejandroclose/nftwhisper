            "description": "Organic Illusion is one of the very first computer graphic drawings I produced that I considered worthy of being called Art. This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory. Like a child you never forget. I submit to you again in new media for you all to enjoy.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "In 1973 I was an instructor of Engineering Graphics in the College of Engineering at Michigan State University as well as a graduate student in Graphic Design. In the College of Engineering I was fortunate enough to meet Christopher Scussel, a fellow graduate student who was majoring in a new program called Computer Science. I was struggling using the earliest forms of computer equipment and the cumbersome programming language called FORTRAN to make make computer art. I asked Chris for help and he graciously consented. That began our amazing friendship that has lasted to this day.\n\nChris and I collaborated on a number of early pieces. He showed me how to formulate algorithms into code. He showed me how to program the primitive equipment of the time: line printers, storage scopes and pen plotters to make graphic output. We even built our own graphic output device, an 8 x 8 array of light bulbs. We were indeed pioneers.\n\nChris graduated in 1976 and has since retired after working 37 years as a research scientist at Bell Labs. I went on to get a Ph.D in 1981 and moved on with my life (see my story on (www.drbillkolomyjec.com). I started making generative art again in 2020. In true \"glory days\" spirit I tracked Chris down to see if he was interested in collaborating. Once again he graciously consented citing an opportunity for \"creative stimulation\", so here we go again. It is pure joy to be working with Chris again. \n\nAfter some initial back and forth I discovered that Chris has always been interested in generating algorithmic images of lines that do not cross. Maybe this has to do with our earlier collaborations of drawing black lines on a white background with a pen plotter. After several iterations Chris came up with the algorithm presented here. It is based on random vectors and linear interpolation that produces voluptuous, organic quality visual landscapes of non-crossing lines. I suggested a few tweaks along the way and the addition of color.\n\nThis piece represents the first \"published\" output of our renewed collaboration. \n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Calligraphy is about formulating letters, not language. \n\nOne of my first exercises as a design student (c. 1967) was learning to letter. Using a nib holding pen and India ink we sat for 5 weeks in class like monks constructing letters in the style of a font called 15th Century Chancery Italic Script. Our final grade was based on how well we hand lettered a paragraph. It was a grueling process that's why I remember it; quite the way to develop an appreciation for the letterforms and type faces. \n\nThis algorithmic artwork is modern cuneiform. It is based on a theory I've developed called \"Language of Vision\" which in itself is an approach for creating a \"plastic\" image. The space-frame or background square consists of a subtle paper texture and defines the tablet. A resizable tile (spatial force) forms the boundary for a \"stroke.\" The stroke within the tile element is created by joining two bezier curves. \n\nAn algorithm called \"fractions of the whole\" is a \"form of spatial organization\" which divides the picture frame into randomly sized intervals along each axes that form the variable sized tile areas. The stroke is programmed to fit each area. This theory lends itself very nicely to algorithmic art and provides a general framework for generative art.\n\nThere is meaning in every image but that meaning comes from your experience and imagination.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

An algorithmic version of Action Painting.\n\nMy Fractions of the Whole algorithm organizes the space frame into areas for a tile comprised of closed paths of bezier line segments with random parameters. An underlying layer is tessellated with tiles made up of closed pathways are filled with a random color; that simulates the chance effects of dripping and spilling paint onto a canvas. Simulating the moving brush-in-hand, nine more iterations the image are overdrawn, each in separate random color, where the shapes are in outline (not filled). The result is a highly dynamic image that simulates the direct, instinctual, and spontaneous application of vigorous, sweeping lines of color.  \n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Calligraphy is about formulating letters, not language. \n\nOne of my first exercises as a design student (c. 1967) was learning to letter. Using a nib holding pen and India ink we sat for 5 weeks in class like monks constructing letters in the style of a font called 15th Century Chancery Italic Script. Our final grade was based on how well we hand lettered a paragraph. It was a grueling process that's why I remember it; quite the way to develop an appreciation for the letterforms and type faces. \n\nThis algorithmic artwork is modern cuneiform. It is based on a theory I've developed called \"Language of Vision\" which in itself is an approach for creating a \"plastic\" image. The space-frame or background square consists of a subtle paper texture and defines the tablet. A resizable tile (spatial force) forms the boundary for a \"stroke.\" The stroke within the tile element is created by joining two bezier curves. \n\nAn algorithm called \"fractions of the whole\" is a \"form of spatial organization\" which divides the picture frame into randomly sized intervals along each axes that form the variable sized tile areas. The stroke is programmed to fit each area. This theory lends itself very nicely to algorithmic art and provides a general framework for generative art.\n\nThere is meaning in every image but that meaning comes from your experience and imagination.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Superimposed Rectangles\n\nThis is the fifth in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nSuperimposed Rectangles is my variation of one of Knowlton’s test examples: Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids (Example 3). As Christopher Scussel continues to revamp the EXPLOR engine I endeavor to understand its capabilities as an aesthetic tool.\n\nThe inherent qualities of an original EXPLOR image is it is low resolution and uses a 4 gray scale color palette. When it was used in the 1970’s images were often generated this way as a series of frames then recorded on film and manipulated in post production. In this image we use a higher resolution (250x250) and employ 3x3 “blocks” of pixels instead of alphanumeric character combinations that we can render in 24bit color. \n\nTHE EXPLOR language consists of a set of functions that manipulate the contents of an internal array. Each element in internal display memory maps into a block in the output image. The CHANJ() function places rectangular areas of blocks over previously drawn sections in internal memory and more important, it applies rules that look at the current state of a particular array element and applies a rule to change that element. The trick is how to make this visually interesting.\n\nI employ a grid structure to distribute a rectangular widget across the picture plane. The widget is a randomly defined area that grows in a random direction based on a set of random variables. During each iteration the new area overwrites internal memory (following a set  of rules). I think this variation looks and feels like Knowlton’s Example 3 and maintains the EXPLOR vibe. The rectangles interact to form dimensional depth and an architectural quality.\n\nWe continue to honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT series. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored now updated by Scussel and Kolomyjec. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history with a modern twist.\n\n(c)2022 Dr. Bill Kolomyjec and Christoper Scussel. All rights reserved.",

            "description": "At the heart of the borders of imagination stands my creation, \"Fata Morgana.\" \nThis abstract work is a bold exploration of the boundaries between reality and dream, a subtle dance between dimensions of perception. \nI forged this vision by giving life to a structure that eludes the human eye like a mirage in a scorching desert.\n\nFrom a distance, this creation draws the observer into a world that merges and blends with reality. The structures emerge as promises of urban architecture, but as they approach, they crumble into patterns of light and color.\n\nColors harmoniously dance, gently fading through ethereal shades. The forms themselves seem to reject definition, refusing to adhere to the laws of perspective and geometry.\n\nThe backdrop of this illusory city is a palette of chromatic emotions. Here, the boundary between the real and unreal completely dissolves, and one finds themselves wandering in a limbo of perceptions, suspended between certainty and wonder.\n\nThe artwork is an invitation to explore the unknown, a celebration of the art of illusion. It is a place where the rules of physics give way to the uninterrupted dance of creativity. In this abstract vision, I hope that everyone can find their own interpretation, a personal meaning that reveals itself like a secret guarded among the nuances of light and shadow.\n\nTo change the density from 1 to 5 (incorrect results set to 1), double-click the left mouse button,\npress S to delete background.\n\nI used p5.min.js - p5.sound.js.",

            "description": "Superimposed Rectangles\n\nThis is the fifth in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nSuperimposed Rectangles is my variation of one of Knowlton’s test examples: Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids (Example 3). As Christopher Scussel continues to revamp the EXPLOR engine I endeavor to understand its capabilities as an aesthetic tool.\n\nThe inherent qualities of an original EXPLOR image is it is low resolution and uses a 4 gray scale color palette. When it was used in the 1970’s images were often generated this way as a series of frames then recorded on film and manipulated in post production. In this image we use a higher resolution (250x250) and employ 3x3 “blocks” of pixels instead of alphanumeric character combinations that we can render in 24bit color. \n\nTHE EXPLOR language consists of a set of functions that manipulate the contents of an internal array. Each element in internal display memory maps into a block in the output image. The CHANJ() function places rectangular areas of blocks over previously drawn sections in internal memory and more important, it applies rules that look at the current state of a particular array element and applies a rule to change that element. The trick is how to make this visually interesting.\n\nI employ a grid structure to distribute a rectangular widget across the picture plane. The widget is a randomly defined area that grows in a random direction based on a set of random variables. During each iteration the new area overwrites internal memory (following a set  of rules). I think this variation looks and feels like Knowlton’s Example 3 and maintains the EXPLOR vibe. The rectangles interact to form dimensional depth and an architectural quality.\n\nWe continue to honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT series. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored now updated by Scussel and Kolomyjec. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history with a modern twist.\n\n(c)2022 Dr. Bill Kolomyjec and Christoper Scussel. All rights reserved.",

            "description": "Organic Illusion is one of the very first computer graphic drawings I produced that I considered worthy of being called Art. This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory. Like a child you never forget. I submit to you again in new media for you all to enjoy.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Creature Transformations is the application of the algorithm of a previous work published here on fxhash called TransformationStudy23. For this generative artwork, I reconstructed the same database from sketches I saved for almost 50 years. A database of the digitized coordinates for four outlined figures (a frog, a cat, an elephant, and a frog) which I used in several plotter art works. These representational figures were contrived; in the sense that they all were all designed to be drawn as a continuous line, digitized in the same direction, and they had the same number of points. This made it relatively simple for me to manipulate them as I learned to program and formulate simple algorithms.\n\nPlease refer to the description for TransformationStudy23 for more background.\n\nBy superimposing two creatures, one over the other, an interesting visual transformation can be made. Line segments of one image are randomly removed based on a percentage which it is drawn over another image whose line segments are added randomly with the inverse percentage. Over a series of frames, it appears that one image changes into the other. To make things a bit more visually interesting I randomly rotate the images in each frame.\n\nFigure one (upper left corner) is a randomly selected creature that I transform to a second creature (lower right corner) over 81 frames. (The sequence represented here as 9 stacked rows of 9).\n\nI choose to not add color and keep the image as true to being drawn on a plotter as was the case back in the 1970's. Black pen on a white background.\n\nI hope you enjoy my retrospective recreation of both the algorithm and its application to the creature menagerie.\n\nPlease visit: www.drbillkolomyjec.com",
