            "description": "### OVERVIEW ###\nThis project revisits some of the foundational ideas in my previous work \"Above (The Infinite)\" and makes them available in a parameterized form for your exploration.\n\nThis project both rewards and requires exploration. I intentionally left the parameter space very broad so that edge case configurations would be possible. In practice this means that additional curation beyond the initial random parameters will very likely be required, in a way that mimics my day to day experience as a generative artist.\n\nThanks to Karsten Schmidt for his excellent thi.ng libraries (https://thi.ng/), which form the technical foundation upon which this work was built.\n\n### CONTROLS ###\ne - Save the current frame as a PNG\nspace - Pause/Resume animation\n\n### PARAMETERS ###\nNOTE: Some combinations of parameters will cause flashing/strobing, which is why I have attached the \"Epileptic Seizure\" label to the project.\n\n* Color Palette: The color palette to apply to the output.\n* Merge Technique: The method used to combine the different patterns.\n* Patterns: The various patterns that can be combined to form the overall resulting tiled pattern.\n* Pattern Scales: The scales used to combine patterns. Higher scale values provide more visible pattern repetition.\n* Deformers: An optional additional spatial deformation of a pattern.\n* Deformer Scales: The scale of the deformation itself. Lower values use less of the deformation space, while higher values include more.\n* Detail: Acts as a filter on the visual complexity of the overall tiled pattern. Lower values will reduce visual complexity, while higher values will increase it.\n* Rotation Rate/Scroll Rates: How fast should the image rotate or scroll. Note: adjusting these parameters may result in visuals that trigger motion sickness.\n* Zoom: Lower values zoom in, higher values zoom out.\n* Round Scales Up?: When checked the pattern scales are rounded up to the nearest integer.\n* Animate?: Should some parameters be adjusted with the passing of time?\n* Low Res?: When checked, force device pixel density to 1, which reduces strain on the GPU, but may result in graphical artifacts. I usually keep this unchecked unless I want to lighten the load on the GPU.\n* Anti-alias?: When checked each pixel will be sampled multiple times to attempt to smooth out possible aliasing. This will put more load on the GPU, and will typically be slower. Can be useful when \"Low Res?\" is enabled.\n\n### HOWTO ###\nHere's how I find interesting things.\n\nFirst, I lock all of the parameters below \"Pattern 3\" at their default values. I will also usually lock both Deformers to \"Empty\", as they can sometimes hide interesting patterns while exploring, and then I experiment with enabling one or both once I have found something interesting.\n\nYou can also explore the options individually (to a certain degree) by setting other patterns to \"Empty\". This can make how patterns affect one another more obvious when you set them.\n\nAt this point I'll randomize the parameters, and then do one of the following:\n\n- If I see something that's extremely noisy/detailed, I'll turn down the \"Detail\" level, which can sometimes smooth things out.\n\n- If a tiling is very tight, I'll lower the \"Zoom\" to see more of the pattern, or the reverse if I want to see more overview.\n\n- If there's still a lot of aliasing/noise in the image, sometimes enabling anti-aliasing will help, but that will affect performance. I usually try to adjust the Scale/Detail/Zoom before resorting to anti-aliasing.\n\n- Interesting patterns are formed by the scale factors controlling how pattern overlap happens. Sometimes enabling \"Round Scales Up?\" will introduce some appealing visual symmetry.\n\n- Enable one or both of the deformers to see what impact they have on the pattern.\n\nFinally, once I've found a pattern that's interesting, I may enable scrolling or rotation. Note that enabling additional movement can increase graphical aliasing, so anti-aliasing may be required depending on the pattern.\n\nI hope you enjoy the exploration process!\n\n- Jeff Palmer\n",

In my opinion, the dynamics of the lines we see in these works are very subtle, the style, the color, and the weight of each line can affect the overall picture of perception. \n\nSince 2018, I've been collecting drawings on Pinterest just for fun. I especially like the selections with spaceships, maps, robots, and boards(chip) because there are so many fine details. \n\nIn my piece called \"Symphony. Dispolarization\" I want to convey a harmonious, or relatively balanced chaos in space, just like our life from day to day we are used to what happens around us one hour, day or week can pass in an instant, based on this I show that next to one particle the world moves with unimaginable dynamics as in a symphony of great composers or, every particle, line, object, has its own rhythm. Still, even with this crazy rhythm, the picture turns out holistic, detailed, and understandable.\n\nPress >>>> \"S\" >>>> save \"IMAGE\"\n\n-Made with p5js.",

            "description": "The third and final installment of the Self trilogy.\n\nEgo is defined as: the one of the three divisions of the psyche in psychoanalytic theory that serves as the organized conscious mediator between the person and reality especially by functioning both in the perception of and adaptation to reality.\n\nPlease see attached fx(text) article or go to https://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy for more on concept/mechanics/etc. It’s a bit of long read, but worth it.\n\nThis is an fx(params) project and you will be able to choose exactly what your iteration will look like. For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

This piece builds on past work on generating abstract landscapes algorithmically. It is an attempt to capture the essence of naturally occurring rock-faces, to capture the diverse vocabularies ranging from the jagged edges of a mountain's summit to the flowing lines of a canyon wall. The result is a constantly evolving display of color and form, abstract yet reminiscent of the intricacies of the natural world.\n\n'S' key to Save image.

It involves drawing intricate designs, typically on the floor, using materials such as colored powders, flowers, and grains. \n\nRangoli is meant to bring prosperity and happiness to a home and can range from simple geometric patterns to more complex depictions of nature.\n\nThe Rangxel tesseracts are created through rule-based instructions, following traditional Rangoli formation principles like symmetry, repeating patterns, and themes, resulting in interconnected, multi-dimensional forms of fragments.\n\nThese monolithic structures also reflect natural 3D grids found in nature such as crystals and honeycombs,presenting a deconstructed, pixelated matrix of our universe. \n\nUltimately, the reality we live in is an abstraction of the algorithm narrated by the creator.\n\n#StayPixelated\n\nControls (){\nDouble click Once to Enable Rotate around Tesseract;\nDouble click Twice to Disable  Rotate;\nDouble click Thrice to Go back original Composition;\nRotate , Zoom , Pan with Touch/Mouse;\n}\n",

A tangled chaos of particles is unhindered with a deep breath and relaxation. With permission to flow, patterns emerge.\n\nTo meditate with this artwork:\n- keep your eyes moving slowly, trying not to fixate on a point.\n- when thoughts arise, gently let them go and return to the artwork.\n- bring your awareness again, to the act of seeing moment by moment.\n\nFlow might arise in many ways- turbulent, synchronous, circular, ephemeral, convergent, divergent, rising, waning or a mix of any of these.\n\n[GPU-intensive, Best viewed @ 4k/full-screen.

            "description": "Generative animated artwork made using shader feedback and pixel quantization.\n\nPRINTERS is a study of rasterized type and bitmap imagery. It builds on the tradition of ASCII and typographic art, blending dithering techniques with chunky, pixelated glyphs. Here, the movement and blending of color is interpreted as a monochrome composition of recognizable pixel patterns taken from legacy video games and operating systems. What appears as typography is actually a custom set of 8x8 pixel patterns rendered in a GLSL shader that produces a conceptual tension between low-res graphics and high-power GPU computation.\n\nPRINTERS is designed to be both viewed on a screen and printed on office paper with a home/office inkjet printer.\n\nPress 'i' to invert the colors.\nPress '1', '2', or '3' to scale the bitmap glyphs.\nPress 'g' to download a looping animated GIF (90 frames).\nPress 's' to capture a single frame.\nPress 'f' (or double tap in mobile) to stretch to full screen.\nMade with vanilla javascript and GLSL.
