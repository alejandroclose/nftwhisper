            "description": "An “algorhythmic” exploration of the oral/aural tradition in poetry. \n\n“Zero is a time of night.\nZero is the color of snow.\nZero is the space between notes.\nZero is the silence between words.\nZero is the pause before breath.\nZero is void in the heart of a crowd.\nZero is not nothing, but it’s not everything.\nOne is a time of day.\nOne is the color of spring grass in sunlight.\nOne is the warmth at the back of my neck when I turn to find you standing there.\nOne is the rhythm at the base of my spine.\nOne is the peace at the core of my being.\nOne is the sound of your voice in the dark.\nAnd one more thing:\nWithout one I am nothing…”\n–Technelegy \n \n\nFusing AI-powered verse, spoken word, original music and visuals all in generative composition, this playful ode to our universal language is inspired by Stiles’ binary-based art and Stern’s performative poetics. The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature. Brought into existence via the blockchain, it is a new form of “token word poetry.”\n\n\nAs with the duo’s other poetry “unreadings,” all minters will receive an airdropped broadside of the full poem after all editions are collected. A 1/1 media-rich version of the entire poem will also be made available. \n \nPoetic traits:\n- 321 editions performed by the algorithm, out of billions of possible combinations\n- Each unique piece contains between 3 and 6 (out of 60) lines of generative text from a poem by Technelegy – a custom text generator fine-tuned on Stiles’ writing and research material, seeded with prompts from Stiles’ and Stern’s work – translated into binary and performed by Stiles\n- 24 possible binary backbeats performed by Stern in his “Nathaniel Fun Time” (NFT) stylings, and generatively re-mixed\n- 98 possible intros\n- 15 musical stems composed by Kris Bones, generating millions of possible mixes\n- Thousands of possible ending combinations \n- 5 fonts, layered in billions of potential ways, including Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer”\n- 13 color palettes based on Stern and Stiles’ respective artworka\n- Very rare attributes including music-less performance, poem-less music, repeated “B1nary 0de” (title only)\n\nClick to start and stop or replay. Although the first play through will be the same every time, starting and stopping may create minor variations in your mix (though not any of the core attributes).\n\n0RAL B1NARY: “BINARY ODE” was produced with partial support from Refraction DAO’s Creative Grants program, and premiered as part of Refraction Festival at Art Basel Miami 2022. 15% of primary sales go to Refraction, and 5% of primary sales will be donated to Black Girls Code.\n",

I define a 3D object, a cube, and construct a number of cube instances into an array that floats in 3D space. Each cube consists of 6 faces, each facet colored one of the 6 \"official\" colors of the Rubik's Cube (TM) palette. Hence, each cube (voxel) represents a solved Rubiks Cube (TM) puzzle.\n\nI use a combination of functions to control the rotation of each cube in its relative position in the array. As each cube is rotated you can see its various colored faces. I maintain the cubes' proper visibility by eliminating the facets of the cube that face away from the viewer, i.e., back face culling.\n\nTo quote my collaborator and friend Chris Scussel: \"I just LOVE the secondary patterns created by the gradual turning of the cubes!  The curves appear and disappear as one looks around the image. Interesting and fun!\" \n\n(c)2022 Dr.Bill Kolomyjec. All rights reserved.\n\nPlease visit www.drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Generative animated artwork made using shader feedback and pixel quantization.\n\nPRINTERS is a study of rasterized type and bitmap imagery. It builds on the tradition of ASCII and typographic art, blending dithering techniques with chunky, pixelated glyphs. Here, the movement and blending of color is interpreted as a monochrome composition of recognizable pixel patterns taken from legacy video games and operating systems. What appears as typography is actually a custom set of 8x8 pixel patterns rendered in a GLSL shader that produces a conceptual tension between low-res graphics and high-power GPU computation.\n\nPRINTERS is designed to be both viewed on a screen and printed on office paper with a home/office inkjet printer.\n\nPress 'i' to invert the colors.\nPress '1', '2', or '3' to scale the bitmap glyphs.\nPress 'g' to download a looping animated GIF (90 frames).\nPress 's' to capture a single frame.\nPress 'f' (or double tap in mobile) to stretch to full screen.\nMade with vanilla javascript and GLSL.
