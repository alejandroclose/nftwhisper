Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file.

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

You can find these on the platform 1stDibs.com/nft (under my name \"nadieh\"). They represent my favorite for each of the seven unique entities. A free mint of this \"Explore Variety\" collection will be airdropped to each buyer of a \"Curated\" piece.\n\n____\n\n✧ OPTIONS ✧\n\nn - Toggle grainy noise on/off (on by default, it's subtle to see)\n\ns - Save the image at the current window size and pixel density\n\nTo save a larger image you can add the parameter `&pixeldensity=2` (or another number) to the end of the URL when viewed on the live page. Afterwards press \"s\" to save the image. The number is the factor with which the width and height are increased w.r.t. the current window size.\n\n-- The larger the image / pixeldensity, the longer it will take to create & save --\n\n____\n\n✧ NOTES ✧\n\nIt works best and fastest in Firefox!\n\nAs of the drop day there is a browser bug for Chrome on the ARM Apple laptops. It incorrectly visualizes certain color blend modes. The following color palettes are affected: Antique, Camping, Pastel, Prime & Rainbow. I hope/assume this will be fixed soon. \n\n____\n\nCreated by Nadieh Bremer\nTwitter & Instagram: @NadiehBremer\nWebsite: VisualCinnamon.com",

            "description": "✧ TWISTINGS ✧\n\nTwistings, the \"Explore Variety\" collection, explores the beauty & variety that is hidden within the simple math of Archimedean spirals.\n\nThere are seven different circular \"entities\", each brought forward by using slightly different mathematical settings of the spiral formulas: Drops, Circles, Fireworks, Flowers, Roses, Spirals & Twisters.\n\n____\n\n✧ CURATED / RANDOM ✧\n\nI love both the concept of a heavily curated set, hand picked by the artist, the best representation / the most beautiful, but also the concept of the larger, random collections showing the variety hidden within the algorithm.\n\nI've therefore also released an \"Artist Curated\" collection of 7 pieces that I meticulously hand-picked from over 1000 outputs. You can find these on the platform 1stDibs.com/nft (under my name \"nadieh\"). They represent my favorite for each of the seven unique entities. A free mint of this \"Explore Variety\" collection will be airdropped to each buyer of a \"Curated\" piece.\n\n____\n\n✧ OPTIONS ✧\n\nn - Toggle grainy noise on/off (on by default, it's subtle to see)\n\ns - Save the image at the current window size and pixel density\n\nTo save a larger image you can add the parameter `&pixeldensity=2` (or another number) to the end of the URL when viewed on the live page. Afterwards press \"s\" to save the image. The number is the factor with which the width and height are increased w.r.t. the current window size.\n\n-- The larger the image / pixeldensity, the longer it will take to create & save --\n\n____\n\n✧ NOTES ✧\n\nIt works best and fastest in Firefox!\n\nAs of the drop day there is a browser bug for Chrome on the ARM Apple laptops. It incorrectly visualizes certain color blend modes. The following color palettes are affected: Antique, Camping, Pastel, Prime & Rainbow. I hope/assume this will be fixed soon. \n\n____\n\nCreated by Nadieh Bremer\nTwitter & Instagram: @NadiehBremer\nWebsite: VisualCinnamon.com",

With permission to flow, patterns emerge.\n\nTo meditate with this artwork:\n- keep your eyes moving slowly, trying not to fixate on a point.\n- when thoughts arise, gently let them go and return to the artwork.\n- bring your awareness again, to the act of seeing moment by moment.\n\nFlow might arise in many ways- turbulent, synchronous, circular, ephemeral, convergent, divergent, rising, waning or a mix of any of these.\n\n[GPU-intensive, Best viewed @ 4k/full-screen.

            "description": "\"flow | meditations\" is part of the live outdoor art installation - 'Computational Convergence' at India Art Fair, held from 9-12 February 2023 in New Delhi.\n\nTo flow is to expand and contract with the waves within. A tangled chaos of particles is unhindered with a deep breath and relaxation. With permission to flow, patterns emerge.\n\nTo meditate with this artwork:\n- keep your eyes moving slowly, trying not to fixate on a point.\n- when thoughts arise, gently let them go and return to the artwork.\n- bring your awareness again, to the act of seeing moment by moment.\n\nFlow might arise in many ways- turbulent, synchronous, circular, ephemeral, convergent, divergent, rising, waning or a mix of any of these.\n\n[GPU-intensive, Best viewed @ 4k/full-screen.
