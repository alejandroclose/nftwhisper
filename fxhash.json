            "description": "“Klyft” is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at PARIS+ par Art Basel.\n\nKlyft is a juxtaposition of two different projections for the future. One, made by the World Economic Forum, suggests that the global gender gap will have closed by the year 2154. The other, by the UN IPCC, estimates that global warming will reach 3.2 degrees celcius by the year 2100.\n\nKlyft makes use of the unique temporal aspect of computational art by developing its expression gradually over the next 132 years. As we come closer to 2154, the space between the two shapes in Klyft will grow smaller to symbolize the closing of the gender gap. As time goes on, however, Klyft also becomes more and more glitched out to represent the projected increases in greenhouse gases and climate catastrophes.\n\nIn the end, Klyft’s expression will be heavily corrupted, and the two shapes will have reached each other.\n\n· URL parameters ·\n\nYou can add the following parameters to the URL to change the behavior of the piece.\n\ndate=<YYYY-MM-DD> — See how Klyft looks on another day. Use the format YYYY-MM-DD. \n\ncolor=<number> — See the piece in another color scheme. The numbers loop around, so 17 equals 0, 18 equals 1, etc. \n\nresolution=<number> — View the piece in a higher resolution. 1 is normal resolution, 2 is double, etc. No decimals allowed.\n\nimage=true — Save the piece as an image. \n\nrecord=true — Save the piece as a video in WEBM format.\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will show Klyft in double resolution on the day gender equality is achieved according to the WEF:\n\ndate=2154-01-01&resolution=2\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will save a video of Klyft in the ‘Stokkendahl Dalgas’ color scheme:\n\ncolor=14&record=true\n\n· Interactions ·\n\nPressing the following keys will trigger functionality as well as add related URL parameters automatically. \n\nPressing D will increment the date by 1 year.\n\nPressing C will increment the color index by 1.\n\nPressing R will toggle between normal and double resolution.\n\nPressing I will toggle the image URL parameter, which saves the piece as an image. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nPressing V will toggle the video URL parameter, which saves the piece as a video. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nThere are secret key presses as well. Some of them only work outside of iframe. \n\n· Accessibility ·\n\nKlyft is built to support screen readers. It has been tested using MacOS’ VoiceOver, and uses p5.js’ describeElement() to provide screen reader functionality.\n\nIf you have any comments (good or bad) on the screen reader integration, don’t hesitate to reach out on my Twitter: @ada_ada_ada_art. \n\n· Credits and license ·\n\nKlyft is made with p5.js.\n\nKlyft is licensed under a modified version of the Climate Strike License (CSL).",

            "description": "We are filling our one and only world with our endless cities, roads and structures, for as far as the eye can see. We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it. Thank you very much for collecting and for your continuous support.\n\n10% of primary and secondary sales will go to fxhash team; thank you for what you are doing.\n\nSelf reserved pieces are for promised gifts to my collectors.\n\nPress S to save as PNG.

Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it. Thank you very much for collecting and for your continuous support.\n\n10% of primary and secondary sales will go to fxhash team; thank you for what you are doing.\n\nSelf reserved pieces are for promised gifts to my collectors.\n\nPress S to save as PNG.

Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "At length, I summoned the courage to approach.\n\n-\n\nI was worn. Months of aimless wandering have culminated in this series; a meditation on my struggles to find a direction in my life and with my art.\n\nAt times paralyzed by too many possibilities, and at other times completely void of ideas. I was lost in the depths of my thinking, overwhelmed by indecision and doubt.\n\nGenerative works are a form of process art, yet along the way I’d forgotten to “trust the process”. It was time to cede control and let each line of code light the way.\n\n-\n\nThis project paints on a 2D canvas, pixel by pixel. I used a custom projection that blends isometric and perspective techniques, to create an uncanny viewpoint between the two. Objects are randomly generated, then an algorithm applies color mixing and position displacement to each pixel as it’s rendered.\n\nBy default the canvas has 2k pixels on its longest edge. You can change this in live view by pressing any number from 1-9. For example, pressing ‘4’ would render it with 4k pixels along the longest edge. I recommend ‘4’, but this can take up to a few minutes to render.\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the rendered image.",

            "description": "## PROJECT DESCRIPTION\n\nWhat is it like to be a sea turtle in the age of plastic?\n\nOur global addiction to single-use plastic is destroying our marine environment. Over 11 million metric tons of waste plastic enter our oceans every year. Thankfully, there is a growing force of ocean defenders rising to combat this crisis. Activists and non-profit organizations around the world are working diligently to solve the ocean plastic problem — but they don’t have nearly enough resources to succeed. This project aims to help.\n\nTurtle Vision uses code, chaos, and regl.js to offer us a glimpse into the experience of a sea turtle in 2023, struggling to survive in an ailing ocean. Turtles prey heavily on jellyfish, but have trouble distinguishing them from the countless plastic bags clogging our oceans given their similar shapes and movement patterns. Because of this, we are finding more and more sea turtles dead on beaches, having starved to death with bellies full of plastic bags.\n\nWe believe that generative art can help to reverse this trend and restore sea turtle populations to pre-plastic levels. Turtle Vision aims to raise money for 5 Gyres, one of the foremost nonprofit groups in the war on single-use plastic. 5 Gyres has a storied pedigree in this space, and has also emerged as a leader amongst conservation organizations in its embrace of blockchain technology.\n\nThis project is a collaboration between renowned generative artist @s_r_r_z, the creator of the iconic Generative Octopuses, and @Casson.tez, a professional ocean conservation activist who works at the intersection of environmentalism and web3.\n\nWe are grateful for the support of Tender.art, fx(hash), TZAPAC, the Tezos Foundation, and the entire Tezos community.\n\n\n## EDITION\n\n- Series size: 534 (it's SEA)\n- Price: 111-99-77-55-33\n- Charity share: 40% of primaries, 5% of secondaries\n\n\n## TECHNICALS\n\nVisuals:\nThis artwork portrays jellyfish intermixed with litter in the ocean, such as plastic bags and masks.

The unnatural drawing order and chromatic differences of the individual faces sometimes yields illusory or paradoxical visual geometries.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png. Press ’4’ to export a high resolution png. Press ’8’ to export a very high resolution png. Press ’e’ to export an SVG file (may take some time and produce large files).\n\nAspect ratio variations are 4:5, 5:4, 2:3, 3:2 and 1:1.\n\nBuilt in Javascript with p5.js, p5.svg and csg.js.",
