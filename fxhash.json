            "description": "POEMS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN [PITPD] represents a new form of poetic anthology—one that celebrates the role of the reader in shaping the life of a poem. In this unique art piece, 14 readers take turns discovering 30 classic poems. We invite collectors to explore this compendium, selected to present a diverse, engaging archive that acknowledges the importance of certain seminal works in shaping our collective unconscious. \n\nInspired by Roland Barthe's maxim, \"those who fail to reread are obliged to read the same story everywhere,\" each reader is represented by multiple pen colors & new marginalia, suggesting the crucial act of rereading. \n\nThe verses vanish, just like our memory of their exact words might fade, but distilled, standout moments of personal connection remain. In time, even these wane, providing a scarcely perceptible backdrop as the poem is discovered & interpreted anew. \n\nPITPD explores authorship. When a poem enters the public domain, it no longer belongs to its author but to its readers. In the intimate moments we read a poem, we link it to our private, pulsating worlds & help ensure others will read it, too. If history’s palms hadn’t held Sappho’s words, our fingers wouldn’t hold them now. \n\nReaders write poetry’s survival. \n\nEach iteration of PITPD traces a narrative that can play for hours without repeating. Some 89% of iterations chronicle the life of a single poem, while 11% include multiple poems, intentionally surveying intertextuality. Taking advantage of the generative medium, embodied readership is represented via dynamic handwriting, dancing markings, algorithmic paper aging, coded stains, & other effects.\n\nSpacebar pauses & resumes the animation. Refreshing the browser window restarts it. For those interested in the underlying code, please open the browser console. This collection’s ciphers, too, are in the public domain.\n\nAdditional information can be found in the companion article on fx(text): fxhash.xyz/article/poems-in-the-public-domain-marginalia-as-living-verse",

Through a grid of 16x16 squares, the work invites the viewer to read this universe, to get lost in it and to discover their own associations and meanings. At the same time, it can be seen as a reflection on the nature of art and its relationship to technology.\nIndeed, this work explores the idea that modern technology, such as the algorithm that generates the geometric figures in this work, can reflect our emotions and thoughts in an unconventional way. Each figure generated is an echo of the other, as if they were the algorithm's responses to our emotional state. This creates a feeling of connectedness and dialogue between our inner and digital worlds, which can be seen as a new form of artistic expression.",

It builds on the tradition of ASCII and typographic art, blending dithering techniques with chunky, pixelated glyphs.

What appears as typography is actually a custom set of 8x8 pixel patterns rendered in a GLSL shader that produces a conceptual tension between low-res graphics and high-power GPU computation.\n\nPRINTERS is designed to be both viewed on a screen and printed on office paper with a home/office inkjet printer.\n\nPress 'i' to invert the colors.\nPress '1', '2', or '3' to scale the bitmap glyphs.\nPress 'g' to download a looping animated GIF (90 frames).\nPress 's' to capture a single frame.\nPress 'f' (or double tap in mobile) to stretch to full screen.\nMade with vanilla javascript and GLSL.

It may take several seconds to produce a recognizable image, and several minutes to produce a high-quality render with no visible noise.\n\nCreated with webgl and clojurescript.\n\nControls:\n\nClick on the canvas to open a menu in the top right corner. In this menu you will see controls to capture a screenshot, adjust resolution, and adjust the camera, along with several other controls.\n\nWhen the \"optimized render\" option is checked, the page will compute an acceleration structure before rendering to allow the piece to converge much faster. With this option checked, the piece may need to process for up to a minute before rendering begins, but subsequently the rendering will proceed much more quickly than normal. This can be used to generate high-quality captures more quickly than when the option is not checked.\n\nWhen the \"filtering\" option is checked, a noise filter will be applied to the result of the render, reducing the appearance of noise.\n\nThe \"logic multiple\" slider can be used to multiply the amount of rendering work done each frame. Increasing this number may allow the piece to render more quickly, but may also make the page laggy. It is not recommended to increase this number unless you have a powerful GPU.",

From a strange coordination, the micro-square society builds its habitat. Influenced by each other, they relate from a sonorous dance. And this is how the swarm lives and reveals -finally- the essence of its own machinery: vestiges and ephemeral moments before leaving.\n\n4 main audiovisual gestures of sonorous dance:\n1. Basic loop\nEach square performs quadrangle movements. It begins and ends at the same point accompanied by a sound.\n2. Contact moment\nAppears when a square reaches a corner of its path and makes contact with another square.\n3. Gesture kamikaze-release\nSometimes these \"contact moments\" result in an impact between the two squares in question, transforming both into a single gesture of fusion, and subsequent release of the swarm.\n4. Queen loop\nAppears when the queen is sighted. Main square that keeps the essence of the machinery.\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js. All sounds are synths programmed in the tone.js library.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "Hexaëder (cube) is a research into abstraction and a search for a balance between simplification and visual complexity.\n\nNo matter how simple and unambiguous things appear to be, in reality they are often more complex. Enjoy the simple, explore the complex.\n\nHexaeder has a wide variety of possible outcomes. I have put together 10 different color palettes; the number of cubes ranges from 10 to 401 (18 different grids); each cell can have 4 different background patterns; each cube can be filled in 4 distinct ways; there are 5 line colors and 16 different \"cube figures\"; the vignette can be black or be the color of the palette, and there are several \"texture settings\". This results in over 1.8 million possibilities.\n\nFor more information see: https://www.behance.net/gallery/131114761/Hexaeder-Flattened-cubes",

            "description": "Adjacent is the third in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art. This piece focuses on the study of Diagonal White, a series he developed between 1970 and 1975.\n\nIn 1976, Ruth Leavitt published a collection of papers titled \"Artist & Computer\", which highlighted the 35 prominent generative artists and asked them to discuss their work. They were posed questions like, \"Do you feel art work created with a computer has now or will have an impact on art as a whole in the future?\". Edward Zajec was a subject of one of those papers and in it detailed the approach to Diagonal White. \n\nThe original program was run on a CDC 6200 computer at The Univeresiry of Trieste. The programming was done in collaboration with Dr. Matjaz Hmeljak, his long-time technical partner. Inspired by his collaborative relationship, Adjacent the output of a partnership between Christine Hall and Chris Maddern.\n\nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to save a high-resolution version of the image\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nBy @christine_hall and @chrismaddern",

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

            "description": "Tendencies is the first in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art in the 1970s.\n\nZajec's generative work was motivated by redundancy in his paintings: \"The monotony of the manual task and the limited number of variations which I was able to produce in a given time made me realize the inadequacy of traditional methods in dealing with our present reality.\" Tendencies was inspired by — and pays tribute to — one if Zajec's earliest forays into generative creation: a work titled RAM 10 V.15, which was written on an IBM 1620 and programmed in FORTRAN.\n\nThe title of the collection itself is a reference to the first exhibition of Zajec's RAM series, while the number of editions minted referencing the year Zajec put plotter to paper.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated December 2022\nBy @christine_hall\n",
