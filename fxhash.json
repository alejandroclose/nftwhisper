            "description": "fx(mash) is my humble contribution to celebrating #fxhashturnsone\n\nThis series is based on a simple algorithm - lines of a random length are drawn on a square grid until the grid is full.\n\nI have added a variety of features based on some of my favorite fxhash projects and a few special guests.\n\nThis collection is intentionally diverse and disorderly, that's a nice way of saying I only had a short period of time following the release of Acequia. As a result, some of the outputs might be weird, messy, or even bordering on broken (if you get one of the latter please let me know and I'll reimburse you).\n\nDespite being a bit rough around the edges, I hope fx(mash) reflects some measure of my love for the fxhash community. If you're feeling kind, then perhaps it even harks back to the experimental early days :)\n\nThe last year has been an incredible journey, thank you for letting me be a part of our story so far.\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press [s] to save the current image\n- Press [g] to toggle grain\n- Press [h] for a high-res output\n\nBeta Controls (in live view, definitely not fully tested):\n\n- Press [p] to start/pause animation\n- Press [i] to slow down animation\n- Press [o] to speed up animation\n\nAll primary sales go to Savepakistan.\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nfx(mash) uses Gorilla Sun's grain implementation, a big thanks to him and meezwhite for a great article that is well worth supporting https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/all-about-that-grain\n\nThank you to the artists who created the following collections.

            "description": "Take your entire life, full as it is with the vastness of your lived experiences – and shape it into your cupped hands. Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",

            "description": "Shattered Obelisks began as a work that is dedicated to my habit of mindlessly drawing on paper when I am stressed, depressed or immersed in difficult thoughts.\n\nLike a patient undergoing psychotherapy and piecing together the causes of unconscious fears and anxieties, I and my artwork have assembled ourselves into something shaped, found order in the chaos and separated it from the external noise.\n\nIt took 3 months of continuous, obsessive work. I have developed a huge library, designed for hand-like drawing. The functionality of this library is four times larger than what is shown in this drop.\n\nI plan to put this library out into the public domain when I deem it complete, and hope that it will help someone express themselves through the creative process as much as it helped for me.\n\nIn case you've encountered a problem with inverted colours, try changing browser or disabling extensions. This problem only occurred once during testing on a massive amount of devices and was resolved by disabling extensions.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES BLOCK:\n\nNOTE 1: This artwork should be viewed at a browser scale of 100%. Reducing the scale will increase the amount of detail, but may unpredictably affect the preservation of the location of secondary objects.\n\nNOTE 2: This work can be printed on a plotter. Click S for saving it in .SVG.\nDetailed instructions and answers to possible questions can be found in the console output of the code.\n\nNOTE 3: This drop is the first one from the series of 3. It will be used as AL ticket in next drops of this series.\n\n@abakshonokoleg\n01.08.2022\nTech: P5.JS\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)",

Different species evolve and interact together, resulting in stabilizing patterns out of their parametric configurations. A form of artificial life.\n\nThis work is based on the paper \"Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks\", written by Jeff Jones and popularized in the artistic field by Sage Jenson. Some features were added to increase the visual and behavioral complexity of the system. Agents are divided into different species, with their own set of rules and interacting with their own substrate. Substrates also interact with each other and agents will mutate in contact of some of them.\n\nNFT License\nRuns properly on Chrome 97.0.4692.99\nGPU intensive\n\nPress P to pause (double tab touch devices)\nPress",

You should try it.\n\nT : Save hidden ‘template’ image\nS : Save current resolution\n1 -> 5 : Save low -> high resolution\n",
