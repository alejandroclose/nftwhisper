            "description": "In 1970, mathematician John Conway devised his eponymous \"Game of Life\", also known simply as \"Life\", a cellular automaton that plays out on a 2D grid of orthogonal cells. The game requires a starting configuration of \"living\" cells (all other cells are assumed to be \"dead\"), and at each discrete step forward in time, the following transformations occur:\n\n- Every living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n- Every living cell with more than three living neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n- Every living cell with exactly two or three living neighbors survives.\n- Every dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes to life, as if by reproduction.\n- Every dead cell without exactly three living neighbors remains dead.\n\nConway's Game of Life feels very simple at its outset. And yet, computer scientists have discovered a staggering degree of complexity, and a vast lexicon of dynamic forms, all within the bounds of its highly constrained 2D universe. It is Turing complete, meaning that given a large enough grid and an appropriate starting configuration, it's possible to create a functional computer inside Game of Life. Given unlimited processing power and memory, one could run Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life... ad infinitum.\n\nBut what would it look like for a small percentage of living cells on the grid, in the course of their \"lives\", to write some poetry?\n\nWhat if each living cell also could increment somehow at each time step it stayed alive, imbuing cells with a visible age?\n\n\"Life in The Waste Land\" is Conway's Game of Life applied to poetry -- more specifically, a poem: The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot.\n\nIn this implementation of Game of Life, the grid is monospaced text, and each living cell has a very small chance of generating a few lines, all entirely inspired by The Waste Land. Each token will track its unique starting configuration's progress forever. The grid is infinite, and the dynamic patterns extend far beyond the fixed boundaries of your screen. Some tokens will remain dynamic for a very long time, while others will settle down quickly, at which point continuously living cells may iterate through nearly every Unicode character.\n\nThank you for collecting. Please enjoy.",

            "description": "RAUSCH is a series of generative artworks that explore imaginary digital architectures. \n\nThis series challenges traditional notions of architectural representation and raises important questions about the role of resolution in design. Just as the pixel resolution of an image affects its perceived quality, the resolution of an architectural space can affect its qualities and livability. By embracing digital variation through codes, this series explores the interplay between abstract and concrete space through multiple resolutions. \n\nRAUSCH is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by complex, chaotic and messy sensations, and aims to engage the viewer through a sense of wonder, disorientation, and awe.\n\nReleased on the occasion of Companions of Code, a group exhibition by VerticalCrypto Art at The NFT Gallery in London. \nCurated by Micol Ap.

            "description": "In 1970, mathematician John Conway devised his eponymous \"Game of Life\", also known simply as \"Life\", a cellular automaton that plays out on a 2D grid of orthogonal cells. The game requires a starting configuration of \"living\" cells (all other cells are assumed to be \"dead\"), and at each discrete step forward in time, the following transformations occur:\n\n- Every living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n- Every living cell with more than three living neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n- Every living cell with exactly two or three living neighbors survives.\n- Every dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes to life, as if by reproduction.\n- Every dead cell without exactly three living neighbors remains dead.\n\nConway's Game of Life feels very simple at its outset. And yet, computer scientists have discovered a staggering degree of complexity, and a vast lexicon of dynamic forms, all within the bounds of its highly constrained 2D universe. It is Turing complete, meaning that given a large enough grid and an appropriate starting configuration, it's possible to create a functional computer inside Game of Life. Given unlimited processing power and memory, one could run Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life... ad infinitum.\n\nBut what would it look like for a small percentage of living cells on the grid, in the course of their \"lives\", to write some poetry?\n\nWhat if each living cell also could increment somehow at each time step it stayed alive, imbuing cells with a visible age?\n\n\"Life in The Waste Land\" is Conway's Game of Life applied to poetry -- more specifically, a poem: The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot.\n\nIn this implementation of Game of Life, the grid is monospaced text, and each living cell has a very small chance of generating a few lines, all entirely inspired by The Waste Land. Each token will track its unique starting configuration's progress forever. The grid is infinite, and the dynamic patterns extend far beyond the fixed boundaries of your screen. Some tokens will remain dynamic for a very long time, while others will settle down quickly, at which point continuously living cells may iterate through nearly every Unicode character.\n\nThank you for collecting. Please enjoy.",

            "description": "WHISPERS (in code) is part of the fx(hash) interactive minting experience at Performance in Code: Deciphering Value in Generative Art, Art Basel Miami Beach, 2022. \nThe project is a collaborative performance between the viewer and AI. It reverses the usual approach of using AI as a tool to perform our intents (as in popular prompt-based AI methods) and gives the decision-making power to the AI, where we, humans, receive instructions on how to proceed in the creative process. Interaction happens in a multi-stage manner, in a metaphor for the process of training neural networks. At each step, after the user performs the action, they can send the image for evaluation by the neural network and receive another instruction (similarly to how networks learn by receiving feedback from the loss function).  What makes us different from the machines, however, is the presence of free will, and our ability to disobey the machine’s guidance. We are not restricted to its instructions and are free to interact with and break the artwork. \n\nArtwork is built on layers of photography, AI, GAN, diffusion, classification convolutional networks, random pixel manipulations, and user interaction. Like with most artist projects, it starts with a few memories, that are then re-imagined by GAN. The initial building blocks are a combination of photographs and AI outputs. The apparent lack of coherent subject choice in input images signifies how we build the perception of the world around us and apply an individual hierarchy to elements worth remembering. The blocks are then stripped of meaning by reducing them to abstract shapes and applying stochastic image transformations, guided by randomness. The neural network then learns to classify the images and outputs its best guesses on how to improve the pictures. \n \nThe goal of the project is to explore the controversial question of authorship through the use of tools incorporating AI. Does it lie with decisive or executive power? Here, the boundaries are blurred and one can no longer distinguish the clear author of a finished artwork - is it the artist, AI, serendipity, or viewer? \n\n\n- Use your mouse to perform machine instructions.\n- Use the \"E\" key to ask the neural network for instructions.\n- Use the \"R\" key to reset the drawing.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.\n",

            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

            "description": "In 1970, mathematician John Conway devised his eponymous \"Game of Life\", also known simply as \"Life\", a cellular automaton that plays out on a 2D grid of orthogonal cells. The game requires a starting configuration of \"living\" cells (all other cells are assumed to be \"dead\"), and at each discrete step forward in time, the following transformations occur:\n\n- Every living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n- Every living cell with more than three living neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n- Every living cell with exactly two or three living neighbors survives.\n- Every dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes to life, as if by reproduction.\n- Every dead cell without exactly three living neighbors remains dead.\n\nConway's Game of Life feels very simple at its outset. And yet, computer scientists have discovered a staggering degree of complexity, and a vast lexicon of dynamic forms, all within the bounds of its highly constrained 2D universe. It is Turing complete, meaning that given a large enough grid and an appropriate starting configuration, it's possible to create a functional computer inside Game of Life. Given unlimited processing power and memory, one could run Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life... ad infinitum.\n\nBut what would it look like for a small percentage of living cells on the grid, in the course of their \"lives\", to write some poetry?\n\nWhat if each living cell also could increment somehow at each time step it stayed alive, imbuing cells with a visible age?\n\n\"Life in The Waste Land\" is Conway's Game of Life applied to poetry -- more specifically, a poem: The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot.\n\nIn this implementation of Game of Life, the grid is monospaced text, and each living cell has a very small chance of generating a few lines, all entirely inspired by The Waste Land. Each token will track its unique starting configuration's progress forever. The grid is infinite, and the dynamic patterns extend far beyond the fixed boundaries of your screen. Some tokens will remain dynamic for a very long time, while others will settle down quickly, at which point continuously living cells may iterate through nearly every Unicode character.\n\nThank you for collecting. Please enjoy.",

            "description": "Hills of Chaos\n\nThe beauty of chaos is the concept that out of disorder, randomness, and unpredictability, can emerge patterns, complexity, and surprising beauty. Chaos theory suggests that small, seemingly insignificant changes in a complex system can lead to dramatic and unpredictable outcomes.\n\nIn art, the beauty of chaos can be seen in many forms, including abstract expressionism, action painting, and generative art. In abstract expressionism and action painting, artists use techniques that rely on chance, spontaneity, and improvisation to create works that are characterized by an energy and vitality that comes from the unpredictability of the process. These works often have a raw and visceral quality that can be very powerful.\n\nGenerative art is another form of art that often celebrates the beauty of chaos. Generative art is created by using algorithms and programming to generate art that is unpredictable and evolving. The artist sets up a system, but the final outcome is determined by the interaction between the system and the viewer. This creates an artwork that is constantly changing and surprising, with the potential for emergent patterns and unexpected beauty.\n\nIn nature, chaos can also be beautiful. Examples include the patterns of clouds, the fractal branching of trees, or the intricate and seemingly chaotic patterns of the ocean waves. These natural systems are often too complex to fully understand, yet they exhibit a beauty that is undeniable.\n\nIn summary, the beauty of chaos lies in its ability to create unexpected and surprising outcomes, whether in art or in nature. The unpredictability and randomness can create patterns and complexity that can be breathtaking and inspiring.\n\nIn 'Hills of Chaos' are two possible sizes, square and rectangular aspect ratios 5000x5000 and 7500x5000, 20 color palettes, some of them taken from \"Studio Yorktown Color Town Hall\" by \n@StudioYorktown (studioyorktown.github.io/coloryorktownhall)\n\nTo download high-resolution 'PNG' file, open 'LIVE' and press 'S'\n\nFebruary 2023\nMade with p5JS library \n\n\n \n",

            "description": "This release marks my first anniversary on the fx(hash) platform! I want to extend a huge thank you to everyone for a fantastic year, and I'm looking forward to many more in the generative-art world!\n\nThe basic algorithm is an evolution of the one I used in my first release, Raked Strokes. Instead of mimicking a brush with parallel segments, I'm using perpendicular line segments to define the overall abstract shape and then drawing each line in a simulated media. This approach blends my first attempts at natural media with everything I've learned in the past year.\n\nViewing in desktop Chrome is recommended for the best results.\nPress 's' to save a screenshot. The image size is 2357x3000px\nPress 'p' to pause/resume during drawing.\n\nFeatures\n- Base path shape: line, circle, diamond, or rectangle\n- Elements defining the spacing and orientation of the line segments\n- The base path painted in the background\n- Monochrome, dark background, and selection of palettes\n- Ink pen styling: thickness, quality, and background blocking\n- Paint styling: color distribution, quality\n- Shapes: triangle, polygons, criteria for insertion\n- Shapes overdrawing: outlines or perpendicular segments\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Matt Perkins, hello@mattperkins.me, @nudoru on Twitter.

            "description": "Florilegium’s inspiration lies in the ancient art of botanical illustration.\n\nHistorically, a florilegium was an anthology of illustrations depicting exotic plants and creatures. These publications reached their peak in the 17th century, with notable examples such as Nehemiah Grew’s “Anatomy of Plants”, Ernst Haeckel’s “Kunstformen Der Natur” and Joseph Banks’ “Florilegium”. These publications have had a lasting impact on both science and art. Today, florilegia often document endangered plant species from specific locations or gardens and are among the most lavish and expensive of books to produce.\n\nIn this generative tribute to the ancient art of florilegia, imagined biomorphic forms compete for space in a garden based on the geometry of circles.\n\nGenerative artwork by AutoEclectus\n\nControls in live mode:\n- After the reveal animation finishes, press [s] to save a png (4000 x 5000px)\n\n@autoeclectus everywhere - Twitter, Instagram and Mastodon\nhttps://autoeclectus.art\n\n© AutoEclectus - NFT License Version 2.0 - January 2023",
