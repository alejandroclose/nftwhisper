            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac.

Move the parameters freely to create your designs.\n\nHowever, completion is short-lived.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, the copies multiply repeatedly.\n\nModifications, alterations, and revisions are applied to the objects.\n\nConcurrently, the paper's decay and replication-induced noise compound on the drawing's surface.\n\nThis process repeats, archives, and...\n\nThe drawing becomes progressively more challenging to decipher.\n\nRandomized years of passage are set.\n\nThe longer the passage, the lengthier the animation, and the more effects overlap on the drawing. Enjoy the evolving animation.\n\nVertical lines flow from left to right throughout the animation.\n\nEach second represents a fictional decay of 10 years, and the year markings regress.\n\nOrigin and Creation of the Artwork:\n\nCurrently involved in the field of architecture, I've come across numerous old architectural drawings. These often prove difficult to interpret due to the obscurity caused by dirt and noise when compared to contemporary blueprints.\n\nWhile deciphering these intricate drawings, the idea emerged to represent the unique replication noise of copiers. Additionally, there's a fondness for the inherent aging of paper, which imparts a sense of history. Drawings that have been cherished and preserved for years progressively deteriorate due to fading and dirt.\n\nI aimed to combine the vintage deterioration seen in old maps and books with the noise generated by machines, creating an effect function.\n\nThe effects encompass both machine noise and aging noise.\n\nFor stochastic noise, I designed functions based on the same principles as actual photocopying.

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

The less practical and most bizarre, basically the most overcomplicated self-made tool anyone could ever imagine. But it's THE tool to explore ideas.\nI created this one to investigate, to poke and nudge at a few concepts that seem to go hand-in-hand.\nFirstly, Representation, as in changing something to better explain it. Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.\n\nWhile many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.\n\nBut there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.\n\nI can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.\n\nWhat happens when a flower has more petals than pixels? Why do we know there's more layers to that thumbnail?\nMy best answer is:\n\n--Press \"s\" key to save a bigger image (2400x3200 px)\n",

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "1) INTRO (MUST READ)\n\"Emotions\" is a unique Animated, watercolor or liquid painting-like abstract generative artwork which incorporates some \"innovative\" or unique techniques and approaches.\n\nIf find the above too selfish or wonder if its worth to buy this sh**t in a relative high price from an unknown \"artist\" please give some time to read the whole description. You will not regret!\n\nI don't like to talk about myself or using marketing expressions, however sometimes have to, in order to clarify some points & spot some important features\n\nAll started as an exercise to shaders on Nov. 2022 and is the completion of this experimentation (rotating colors): twitter.com/Uniray_net/status/1587588272842280961 \n\n\n2) SHORT BIO\nI was always between graphics & programming. Was very good in both areas (as my teachers were saying) & remember me also drawing from childhood \nThe first years i was focusing more in graphics (i was teaching graphics as well) and i was programming graphics for hobby\n\nFrom 2005 & later i started a turn in my career & made programming my profession for the last 13-14 years (developer in some private companies)\nIn 2020 I started again a more serious involvement with graphics without knowing anything about NFTs or WEB3. And from 2021 i started getting more & more involved. Still so many to learn\n\nI am new in gen art, started few months ago with plain javascript.\nStarted learning p5js in Aug. 2002 and shaders in Oct. 2022 & \"Emotions\" is my first \"large\" work. \nAlready published some simpler & old works (eg. 3D) & things i developed as i was learning\n\n3) FEATURES\nI think i am presenting something relatively different with \"Emotions\" & always try to apply one of my favorite motto: \"Lead, don't follow\"\n\nThe general experience in programming & the fact that i had already programmed graphics in conjunction with my love for experimentation & searching behind the things, helped me to incorporate in \"Emotions\" some \"innovative\" i believe features & techniques (it sounds selfish but let me explain)\n\n- First i am \"proud\" of the shader work. I developed completely custom \"advanced\" techniques that discovered after experimentation & some knowledge of course.\n\n- \"Emotions\" includes 51 palettes (with several color each) that have been stored externally (in the application folder) as Adobe \".act\" color table files so that avoiding hard coded (including all palettes in the code) consuming in this way resources eg. memory from user's system. I just load only the one palette i am going to use\n\n- A fast svg Convolution kernel Matrix filter along with a displacement filter used for the texture\n\n- Lastly & minor, you can switch Orientation (Portrait, Landscape, etc) & Resolution with the press of a key (no need to manually add params in the url)\n\nFrom the above the most important part is the webGL shader.\n\n4) CONCLUSION\n\"Emotions\" is an animated watercolor painting-like (or liquid pigments material) abstract \"live\" work, that instead of staying static, starting with an initial state & slowly flowing, changing shapes & colors as sometimes happens with our emotions & feelings which may changed over time. \nColors also represents emotions eg. red is for passion, green is the color of hope, etc \n\nGive some time to observe the progress and liquid feel and motion in shapes and colors.  Relax and look the flow and color diffusion - spread  & the whole \"painting\" to transformed slowly. \n\nKEYS:\n- 1-4: Set resolution from 1x to 4x of the current dimension (slower performance in higher values)\n- T: Texture on/off\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait (default). Aspect ratio 0.75\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape with ratio 4/3\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ between orientations\n\n- Spacebar: animation on/off\n\nMOUSE:\n- Click: animation on/off\n- Move: left - right on canvas (when in animation) to interact\n\n----\nMade with p5js & custom shaders.

            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac.

The less practical and most bizarre, basically the most overcomplicated self-made tool anyone could ever imagine. But it's THE tool to explore ideas.\nI created this one to investigate, to poke and nudge at a few concepts that seem to go hand-in-hand.\nFirstly, Representation, as in changing something to better explain it. Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.\n\nWhile many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.\n\nBut there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.\n\nI can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.\n\nWhat happens when a flower has more petals than pixels? Why do we know there's more layers to that thumbnail?\nMy best answer is:\n\n--Press \"s\" key to save a bigger image (2400x3200 px)\n",

            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac. In case the site crashes, close all other applications and retry. If you’re not able to render in 12K on your device, please get in touch (@pxlshrd on Social Media and Discord).\n\nPlease note:\n- The Adaptive mode has a slightly altered appearance compared to the default aspect ratio.\n\n- The code was tested on Mac Apple Silicon/Windows/iOS/iPadOS with consistent and pixel-perfect results throughout.\n\n- The live view on Android devices slightly deviates from those on the systems mentioned above.\n\n/////\n\nCreated with p5.js and GLSL shaders.",

Circumscript uses a custom shader written to mix and \"dilute\" the colors on the canvas, thus creating a very physical feeling piece.\n\nThis dilution can be more or less depending on the edition, but always plays a huge role in the feel of the piece.\n\n\nHappy new year.\n\n\n----\n\n\n[m] or [double tap] : opens the export/settings menu, use this menu to change the resolution, and make sure to press the reload button if you do.\n[holding down] : zooms in on a certain area of the piece, depending on where your mouse/finger is. Use this feature to expore the complex textures of the piece in more detail, it's highly recommended to do this on a higher resolution setting.\n\nThe outputs can vary slighty per device, as there's a slight difference in how certain math gets interpreted on different devices with shaders.\n\n\n----\n\n\nMade with p5.js and webgl by Wouter Missler in 2022/3.",
