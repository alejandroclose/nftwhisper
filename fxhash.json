As part of that quest on mooncakes.fun, users are encouraged to mint this generative token.\n\nThis is a layered image composition using the Mooncakes site images on a 1920x1080 canvas. The image elements are randomly assigned position, scale, tint, and blur according to a ruleset which generates a Mid Autumn Festival scene made up of: Moon, Clouds, Stars, Lanterns, and Lotuses.\n\nSpecial filters, shapes and colors are included as rare features, as well as a couple of surprises.",

Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",

            "description": "Take your entire life, full as it is with the vastness of your lived experiences – and shape it into your cupped hands. Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",

            "description": "\"Finestre\" means windows or apertures in Italian. This generative art project was inspired by the appreciation of collected memories, windows in time to our past experiences and loved ones. Using basic geometry such as rectangles, squares, circles, ellipses, triangles with random compositions and many possible color palettes, Finestre presents our impression of portals to the Universes of collected memories through abstract still code-based outputs.\n\nFinestre is a collaboration generative art project between generative artists Gonz0x and Schizzo.\n\nFinestre has some fun interactive features which allows collectors to view the work in different configurations. For example, collectors can isolate the deconstructed background layers, isolate the main constructed layer, add Grain and also enter a Free Play mode which allows for the option to draw background and foreground layers, stacking infinitely. You can Save off a render as a .png.\n\nPress \"C\" for Constructed Mode (Isolate Foreground)\nPress \"D\" for Deconstructed Mode (Isolate Background)\nPress \"R\" to reset to Default = C & D\nPress \"G\" to add grain texture with each press\nPress \"S\" saves render\n \nPress \"F\" to toggle Free Play mode\nIn Free Play, Press \"Q\" repeatedly to add Deconstructed layers\nIn Free Play, Press \"W\" repeatedly to add Constructed layers",

It draws hundreds of thousands of tiny points according to a probability distribution calculated from the positions of the dunes.\n\nThe logic to divide the dunes into light and dark sides is simple, but produces some interesting chaotic behaviour. These are details that weren't hard-coded but emerge organically, such as the patterns on the spines of the dunes or the stripes around their bases.\n\nPlease note that the algorithm can take some time to run, especially when the number of dunes is high.\n\nCreated by lunarean.",

The log book spread out before me seemed less appealing than talking with my friends at the back of the classroom, and so it was I found myself, palm outstretched, feeling the whack of Mrs. Robinson's ruler, ten times over. \"Math sucks.\" Or so I thought.\n\nBack then I knew nothing of the beauty that I would later see in Mathematics – something which became apparent as I taught myself to code, especially using Processing.\n\nThis work – based on code I've been playing around with since 2009 – is my small homage to that beauty. Originally based on Ulam spirals, I've then played around with that starting formula to create an infinite numbers of patterns using square roots, cosines and modulus. If only they had shown me these possibilities when I was younger I may have avoided the dreaded ruler of Mrs. Robinson.\n\n",

In the end, he decided to destroy himself to make a New cosmos of all generative planets from ash of himself and his daughter's soul to one more time in the eternity they can be with each other in a heart of a planet.
