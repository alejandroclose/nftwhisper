            "description": "*WTBS.TXT* is the first collaboration between Thomas Noya and the Waiting To Be Signed podcast crew. Using the first year of episodes as training data, Thomas trained a GPT-2 model to generate text strings from seed words, phrases, or at random; over 3000 strings were curated from the model over several months. The strings are then randomly selected from the curated set and displayed in various fonts and patterns, evoking a retro-PC style inspired by 90s net.art.\n\nAn advantage of using so little data to train a model (yes, a year of content is nothing in AI terms) is that it allows the model to run wild and create funny and fantastical diversions. We used an AI service to transcribe the episodes, which introduced many spelling variations around fx(hash)-specific terms and artist names. All of this adds up to something that we are collectively excited to share with you.\n\nFrom WTBS: A year went by fast... so fast that we fully missed doing anything to celebrate. Please think of this token as a belated celebration of the first year of Waiting To Be Signed. This project could not be possible without the hours of content we produce each week. If you have enjoyed the show, we hope you will enjoy this as well. Please collect to support the continued creation of WTBS. Collect because you are a fan (of Thomas, us or both). Collect because it is a really cool project. Huge thanks to Thomas for volunteering his time to work with us on this, and thank you to everyone who listened and supported us as we move into our second year of the show.\n\n\nControls:\n[s] save as PNG\n\n\nWTBS ⫸ GPT-2 ⫸ p5.js ⫸ Blockchain\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2023 Thomas Noya and Waiting to be Signed\n\n◉_◉",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

This interactive minting project seeks to transform the traditional minting experience into something truly unique and unexpected.\n\nEach 'Portal' gives you access and 1x reserve for all future 'The Passage' experiences both virtual and IRL.\n\nFor more information, visit hereandnow.events or join the discord, and join us in redefining what it means to mint.\n\nSee LICENCE.md for license details.\n\nTECHNOLOGY :::::::::\n\nThis token is designed using a custom-built raymarching engine, built in a way that allows me to pass in chunks of GLSL code as determined by the params and features.\n\nThe geometry is generated using what's called a KIFS (Kaleidoscopic Iterated Function System) fractal, which involves taking the space, folding it, offsetting it, drawing in it, and repeating. By doing this, we can create some *very* complex appearing geometry using some relatively simple rules.\n\nFinally, this is an intense simulation and requires a somewhat powerful GPU to properly be enjoyed.\n\nCONTROLS :::::::::::\n\nMouse - Click and drag to move the camera around in the space.\nQ/E - Roll the camera.\nR/F - Change the speed of the camera.\nSPACE - Stop the camera from moving.\nO - Output a still picture without DOF.\nP - Output a still picture with DOF.\n\nURL PARAMS :::::::::\n\n&still=true\nThis will just render a still image.\n\n&dpr=X\nWhere X is a number. Will allow you to render the token to a higher or lower resolution\n\n&fullscreen=true\nAllows you to render the token at the screen resolution of your browser.\n\n&width=X &height=Y\nAllows you to set the specific dimensions of the token.\n\n&dof=true\nTurns fake depth of field on.\n\n&doflenngth=X\nChanges the length at with the DOF is calculated.\n\n&steps=X\nAllows you to explicitly set the number of steps the raymarcher can use.",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

Using the first year of episodes as training data, Thomas trained a GPT-2 model to generate text strings from seed words, phrases, or at random; over 3000 strings were curated from the model over several months. The strings are then randomly selected from the curated set and displayed in various fonts and patterns, evoking a retro-PC style inspired by 90s net.art.\n\nAn advantage of using so little data to train a model (yes, a year of content is nothing in AI terms) is that it allows the model to run wild and create funny and fantastical diversions. We used an AI service to transcribe the episodes, which introduced many spelling variations around fx(hash)-specific terms and artist names. All of this adds up to something that we are collectively excited to share with you.\n\nFrom WTBS: A year went by fast... so fast that we fully missed doing anything to celebrate.

            "description": "This token was created for THE PASSAGE: Pitch Drop experience, an interactive minting experience where your choices determine the design of your token. \n\nTo take part, please purchase an Edition 5 Coin on fx(hash) by HERE & NOW. The artwork and experience draw inspiration from the 'The Pitch Drop Experiment': the world's longest-running laboratory experiment. Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\n____\n\n\nWhile we wait for the 10th drop of pitch to fall in the famous Pitch Drop experiment, I couldn’t avoid thinking about time and change, capturing and preserving a moment of time, the history of art and science, and how we participate in the manipulation of the time itself.  \n\nThe history of new media art is deeply linked to technical developments in photography and its creative applications. With still and moving images, artists were introduced to a new way of visualizing time. Through the use of time lapses, long exposures, slowing down, and fast forwarding, time was manipulated, captured, rearranged, and modified in numerous ways.\n  \nThe French philosopher Henri Bergson believed that reality was in flux and that \"the essence of time is that it goes by.\" His thoughts about time and metaphysics had a significant impact on artists working in all media at the turn of the 20th century. Although he believed in pure perception unaided by machines, and looked down on the introduction of technology into the arts, for artists, who had always been fascinated with the body in space and time, he became their muse. Even before the widespread adoption of technological advances in artistic practices, painters were incorporating aspects of \"movement of time\" into their works (e.g., futurists, Giacomo Balla, but also Marcel Duchamp ). \n\nAnother influential figure for artists was Eadweard Muybridge. In 1878 he photographed a racehorse at full speed, becoming the first to capture what looked like the actual, discrete sequence of motion. After devising the system of several cameras (12 for the first sequence he made), set in a row and arranged to go off in a sequence (with shutters released by pulled strings), he became fascinated with “secrets of time, secrets locked inside basic human movements – a leap, a splash, a walk […]”*. \n\nAll of this inspired me to create and capture algorithmically generated shapes, and record their subtle changes through time and space in the style of vintage scientific illustrations, film strips, long-exposure photos, and comic book panels. Each frame inside this view is one fraction of a second later than the previous one, and the whole frame view is slightly shifted. Your actions inside of the Passage will influence everything, from the number of rows and columns inside of the grid to the color palettes, shapes, and sizes of the objects.\n\n_____\n* Jad Abumrad (host) & Rebecca Solnet (author) say this when they talk about Muybridge in the episode Time, on the Radiolab podcast, aired Aug 24, 2010 (https://radiolab.org/episodes/91584-time)\n",

            "description": "*WTBS.TXT* is the first collaboration between Thomas Noya and the Waiting To Be Signed podcast crew. Using the first year of episodes as training data, Thomas trained a GPT-2 model to generate text strings from seed words, phrases, or at random; over 3000 strings were curated from the model over several months. The strings are then randomly selected from the curated set and displayed in various fonts and patterns, evoking a retro-PC style inspired by 90s net.art.\n\nAn advantage of using so little data to train a model (yes, a year of content is nothing in AI terms) is that it allows the model to run wild and create funny and fantastical diversions. We used an AI service to transcribe the episodes, which introduced many spelling variations around fx(hash)-specific terms and artist names. All of this adds up to something that we are collectively excited to share with you.\n\nFrom WTBS: A year went by fast... so fast that we fully missed doing anything to celebrate. Please think of this token as a belated celebration of the first year of Waiting To Be Signed. This project could not be possible without the hours of content we produce each week. If you have enjoyed the show, we hope you will enjoy this as well. Please collect to support the continued creation of WTBS. Collect because you are a fan (of Thomas, us or both).

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

            "description": "The story behind this collection is that there isn't really a story behind this collection. It is the result of play, tinkering, and curiosity.\n\nOne of the beautiful things about generative art is how we can achieve drastically different results simply by modifying a few parameters or lines of code. As my first release here on fxhash was 'Sabler', it felt fitting that my release for #fxhashturnsone would itself be a modified version of that 'Sabler' algorithm, albeit giving drastically different results.\n\nIt is notable for the fact that this is perhaps my most 'chaotic' collection yet, letting go of carefully considered proportions, angles and positioning and here leaving that in the hands of the computer. In a way, this simple act represents several design decisions I never would have imagined myself making a year ago, highlighting my growth as a generative artist over the past year.\n\nIt is also a reflection of the inspiration gained from many of the artists and boundary-pushers in the space that each time unlock and encourage creations beyond the immediate comfort zone. For that, this is a 'Thank You' to all of you.\n\nWith that, here's to many more years of generative beauty and inspiration on fxhash and beyond.\n\nAs with previous collections, I highly recommend viewing the images at full size and savouring the details and the chaos up close. Pressing 'S' will save a 6000 x 6000 px PNG file.\n\n50% of primary sales will be donated to the Processing Foundation.",

By default the dance is paused after a few seconds to render a painting.\n[S] Save the current view (live mode).\n[V] Capture a short webm video (live mode).\n\nMouse Controls (while dancing): \n[left drag] Rotate\n[scroll] Zoom\n[right drag] Pan\n[right click] Save image\n\nBest viewed in a desktop browser. The output may be different from the preview image if your frame rate is low, reducing the size of the browser window can help improve the frame rate.\n\nMade using Three.js, canvas API and WebGL2.\nThe 3D model is based on https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/mannequin-dances-ballet-a24678a81a6f4b6d8f8ba0eb1a78e58b, using motion capture data from dancedb.eu. \nTest in Chrome v107.0.5304.107 and Safari v16.1.\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n\nCreated by elsif, 2022.11.\n",
