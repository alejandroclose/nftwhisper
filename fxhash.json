            "description": "1) INTRO (MUST READ)\n\"Emotions\" is a unique Animated, watercolor or liquid painting-like abstract generative artwork which incorporates some \"innovative\" or unique techniques and approaches.\n\nIf find the above too selfish or wonder if its worth to buy this sh**t in a relative high price from an unknown \"artist\" please give some time to read the whole description. You will not regret!\n\nI don't like to talk about myself or using marketing expressions, however sometimes have to, in order to clarify some points & spot some important features\n\nAll started as an exercise to shaders on Nov. 2022 and is the completion of this experimentation (rotating colors): twitter.com/Uniray_net/status/1587588272842280961 \n\n\n2) SHORT BIO\nI was always between graphics & programming. Was very good in both areas (as my teachers were saying) & remember me also drawing from childhood \nThe first years i was focusing more in graphics (i was teaching graphics as well) and i was programming graphics for hobby\n\nFrom 2005 & later i started a turn in my career & made programming my profession for the last 13-14 years (developer in some private companies)\nIn 2020 I started again a more serious involvement with graphics without knowing anything about NFTs or WEB3. And from 2021 i started getting more & more involved. Still so many to learn\n\nI am new in gen art, started few months ago with plain javascript.\nStarted learning p5js in Aug. 2002 and shaders in Oct. 2022 & \"Emotions\" is my first \"large\" work. \nAlready published some simpler & old works (eg. 3D) & things i developed as i was learning\n\n3) FEATURES\nI think i am presenting something relatively different with \"Emotions\" & always try to apply one of my favorite motto: \"Lead, don't follow\"\n\nThe general experience in programming & the fact that i had already programmed graphics in conjunction with my love for experimentation & searching behind the things, helped me to incorporate in \"Emotions\" some \"innovative\" i believe features & techniques (it sounds selfish but let me explain)\n\n- First i am \"proud\" of the shader work. I developed completely custom \"advanced\" techniques that discovered after experimentation & some knowledge of course.\n\n- \"Emotions\" includes 51 palettes (with several color each) that have been stored externally (in the application folder) as Adobe \".act\" color table files so that avoiding hard coded (including all palettes in the code) consuming in this way resources eg. memory from user's system. I just load only the one palette i am going to use\n\n- A fast svg Convolution kernel Matrix filter along with a displacement filter used for the texture\n\n- Lastly & minor, you can switch Orientation (Portrait, Landscape, etc) & Resolution with the press of a key (no need to manually add params in the url)\n\nFrom the above the most important part is the webGL shader.\n\n4) CONCLUSION\n\"Emotions\" is an animated watercolor painting-like (or liquid pigments material) abstract \"live\" work, that instead of staying static, starting with an initial state & slowly flowing, changing shapes & colors as sometimes happens with our emotions & feelings which may changed over time. \nColors also represents emotions eg. red is for passion, green is the color of hope, etc \n\nGive some time to observe the progress and liquid feel and motion in shapes and colors.  Relax and look the flow and color diffusion - spread  & the whole \"painting\" to transformed slowly. \n\nKEYS:\n- 1-4: Set resolution from 1x to 4x of the current dimension (slower performance in higher values)\n- T: Texture on/off\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait (default). Aspect ratio 0.75\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape with ratio 4/3\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ between orientations\n\n- Spacebar: animation on/off\n\nMOUSE:\n- Click: animation on/off\n- Move: left - right on canvas (when in animation) to interact\n\n----\nMade with p5js & custom shaders. Pure code. No Images used\n\n© Dec. 2022  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

It began as a study of points of light, with geometric objects in the background. The background objects developed a life of their own and then birds, and ships, made out of bezier shapes became the focal points. Then everything got lost in clouds before the collection as it stands now emerged. Aside from the published traits, many of the artifacts created on the way are still generated. For example, star fields, birds, sonars and gas bubbles. These are sometimes visible, but when they appear, it is simply by some chaotic chance.\n\nThis collection has been coded with P5js and WebGL.

            "description": "This project is borne out of my longstanding fascination with brushwork, and the intricate textures that can be created with a brush, some paint and a canvas. Brush strokes are simulated using many overlapping lines and given texture and depth using a custom shader. Another important aspect of this work, is the composite forms that are created by the brush strokes, which are my attempt to emulate the emphatic energy of many abstract painters that have come before me. Color palettes are named after common paint colors, based on the background color used for the palette.\n\nThose who collect during the first tier of the Dutch Auction can claim a signed print. They will be printed on A3 Hahnemuhle Photo Rag, and shipped to the collector free of charge. More details on how to claim a print and specify the necessary shipping information will be provided via the artists twitter (@landlinesart1).\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

            "description": "This token generates a deterministic set of minimal, abstract buildings of varying widths, heights, transparencies, and patterns, assembling a skyline view of your own unique imaginary city. Each city comes with its own randomized city day.\n\nEach mint has a native setting (Day or Night) which combined with the current time of viewing influences real-time movements of celestial bodies in your mint, e.g. on a mint with the Day setting, the sun will only appear when viewed during the day. The piece will re-render every minute.\n\nThe individual strokes of this token feature some of my latest developments of an algorithm that generatively simulates the texture of print imperfections. They are randomized at each render to give it a unique character. Note that depending on the complexity of each mint, some renders may introduce a brief pause. The aesthetics are greatly inspired by plotter art of early computer artists such as 'City Painting' by Grace C. Hertlein.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Nov 2021\nArtist: @Yazid",

Mint or collect “fx(haish) - the Generator”\nStep 2. Visit https://www.arqtistic.com/fx(haish) to generate your “fx(haish) - The AI City” based on your mint. You have 20 tries.\nStep 3. Await further instructions.\n\n\n// FURTHER INFO\n\nThis algorithm has been designed to produce images which are suitable for the subsequent AI generation. The token consists of a random number of randomly placed and sized rectangles, filled with a noise gradient pattern. In short, Diffusion AI Models thrive on noise.\n\nThe AI generation uses Stable Diffusion 1.5 through an API designed by the 330ai team (@Pixelmindai). The WebUI has been developed by Nik0gda (@AntonCebanu2). AI Prompt has been designed (by me) to produce images of Cities, but you can possibly make it do other things, if you try hard enough.",
