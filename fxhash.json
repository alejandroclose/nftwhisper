The grid cells get subdivided into another grid and the resulting cells become filled with pixels in color (~33%) or black and white (~66%).\nThe colored pixels come in 3 different coloring styles.\n- Big Palette (~49%)\n- Small Palette (~49%)\n- Monochrome [b/w] (~2%)\n4 noise algorithms modify the pixels of selected grid cells while at the same time 4 reset algorithms reassemble the initial image. The selected cells switch over time.",

The algorithm is specifically designed to preserve the cognitive functions of the species during \"slow time\" and overload. The use of the algorithm by other races has not been studied.

They are switched by click. Each switch changes the input parameters, so there are quite a few options\n\n!!!Flashing lights seizure warning!!!",

            "description": "A mix of aesthetics from the Ukiyo-e and Shin-hanga woodblock movements, with modern elements.  \n\nukiyo-e (浮世絵) = \"pictures of the floating world\", which peaked in the late 19th century. \nshin-hanga (新版画) = \"new prints\", from roughly the 1920-1950s. \n\nSome comparisons between the prints of the Japanese masters and gen-art: \n\n* The number of prints. Based on how well a piece was received, the publisher could decide to produce more copies, usually in batches of 200. Compare this to limiting the edition size on fx(hash). The initial prints would have sharp lines and accurately coloured areas. Very popular prints with thousands of impressions would slowly degrade the blocks, leaving final prints with worn-out linework and colours that weren't true to originals.  \n\n* Woodblock prints were actually a collab between the artist, the wood carver, and the printer. In many cases only the artist and publisher were recognized on the final prints. It was usually the publisher who owned the woodblock, not the artist. Often the artist was considered a worker, contracted at the request of the publisher or patrons funding the project. Compare this to the NFT space, where ownership is carved onto the blockchain, and artists have freedom to create whatever they wish. \n\n* Copyminters.... Similar to the NFT world, fake publishers sprang up from time to time, who would reproduce famous prints. Enji Takamizawa was one such counterfeiter, who was able to skilfully produce woodblocks replicating originals down to the wood grain! \n\n* While fine-quality woodblock prints from the Edo era command huge auction prices today, they were in reality affordable art for the regular people of their time. NFTs are similar in this light, where we can enjoy pieces at home rather than say, visiting galleries or museums of unattainable art. \n\n\n\nAdditional querystring params (use when viewing in a separate window) \n\n* fullsize=true (33 megapixel output) \n* colourcorrect=false \n* grain=false \n* border=false \n\n\n\nLicenses included in source. Relying on: \n\n* PIXIJS for drawing \n* JSTS for geometry functions \n* chromajs for colour functions \n* noise and gaussian helpers from p5js ",

            "description": "This generator is named 'Ichigo' (苺/ いちご), the Japanese word for 'strawberry'. \n\nSeeing each iteration from a suitable distance, small dots (to me, reminiscent of strawberry seeds) overlay different sequences of geometric repetitions, implying a sense of texture, grittiness and irregularity. \n\nBy looking closer however, it becomes apparent to the viewer that the majority of the composition is in fact government by orderly elements, in this case grids of dots. \n\nThis discovery invites the viewer to consider the output in front of them at different levels, near and far. At what point do you feel the dots begin to dissolve into a texture? When do you stop noticing the dots and instead begin to perceive the overall composition?\n\nThese questions are posed in a similar fashion as with meditation; at what point does something become something else? When does an in-breath become an out-breath and vice versa? \n\nContemplation on simple questions like these can open a small portal into stillness and mindfulness by taking time to slowly observe our responses. \n\n23 palettes are included, each named after different areas of Tokyo. \n\nPress 'S' to download a full size 6000px x 6000px PNG output. \n\nAs always, much gratitude and enjoy your piece.

            "description": "by Daeinc\nAug 2022\n\nDuet explores generative+computational motion and creates an almost infinite sequence of visual compositions. Two groups of shapes transform, merge, and split randomly. What can be disorienting starts to make sense as every element is animated from one to the other. This transition animation is what connects random pieces and creates a relationship between them. Each element is mathematically interpolated, with its motion defined by an equation. \n\nAlthough there are key moments, it is hard to summarize time-based work as a static image. As a constantly evolving generative motion piece, Duet invites viewers to form their impression by feeling the rhythm over time.\n\n## Guide:\n- The animation responds to window aspect ratio. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- For reliable playback, keep the window active and use IPFS view.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.5.1 with Chromium 104.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction\n- [n] to play a new random loop.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause.\n- [s] to save PNG. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [up] and [down] to change shape resolution.\n- [left] and [right] to change BPM. only works while looping. \n- [h] to toggle high DPI mode. off by default.\n- [p] to toggle pixel snapping. off by default.\n\n## URL Parameters\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&w=1200&h=600\n- [w] and [h]: set width and height in pixels. (ex. w=1200&h=600)\n- [s] and [e]: set starting and ending keyframes (inclusive) for loop. (ex. s=20&e=24) \n- setting large values for start/end is not advised.\n- [len]: instead of start/end, set a loop length between 1 and 16. (ex. len=4)\n- [bpm]: beats per minute. (ex. bpm=80)\n- [res]: shape resolution between 0 and 18. (ex. res=2)\n- [pr]: pixel ratio. set it to 2 (or press [h]) for hi-DPI screens.\n- [ar]: maximum aspect ratio. set to any value over 1. 1.2 by default.\n- [snap]: add the param to snap to pixel grid.\n\n## License\nCC BY-NC 4.0\nPlease refer to the included LICENSE.md for license information.\nLibraries used: canvas-sketch, canvas-sketch-util, dom-events, hsv2rgb, keyframes, equations from easings.net, array shuffle from stackoverflow.",

            "description": "culture and community are not an organic occurrence. they are painstakingly constructed in a wholly sterile lab that suffocates sickening spontaneity or reprehensible natural evolution. in this lab, there exists true beauty, without the perversion of free thinking or differing perspectives. interests are dictated by gloved hands and surgical masks. flesh is pulverized into optimal packaging. and mouths are opened with car jacks for optimal penetration.\n\nthat’s why we here at Fxck Kulture Labz (a partner of Meatverse) are creating a one of a kind, grassroots, visionary project that euthanizes the need to think before consumption and destroys everything that came before. we’ve rented out a mall kiosk that used to sell metal dragons holding orbs and shrimp deveiners shaped like medieval hernia belts and have transformed it into a one stop shop for factory farmed revolutionary art that is perfect top soil for more genetically modified celebrities and brands to spawn from. because we at Fxck Kulture LaBz believe that creation is simply a pointless product of consumption and what you put in will never come back out.\n\neach celebrity has been hand crafted for ideal cultural impact, with varying deformities, goiters and impacted hairs grown thoughtfully from the medical waste of other celebrities who are also desperate for another insufferable attention grab. they’ve sacrificed themselves for you. because you didn’t have what it took to build something. so do what you need to do. for them. by buying their deformed, barely sentient heads to worship at. it would really make them feel better. and there’s nothing worse than an upset genetically modified celebrity and brand collaboration corpse.\n\nfeed them. grow them. wonder if this means anything at all. drink from the never ending drain of reheated influencer bath water. die with the most likes.\n\nthank you @purespider for the code!",
