            "description": "Just,Steven - is a shell that has always followed me, or has been a part of me, I never fully understood. This is a character who ironically, because of the many social culture shifts in his life, began to resort to the way of putting other people's faces and stories on himself. At first it was necessary to adapt in a certain circle of society so as not to be a black sheep, after a few years he stopped noticing how the consciousness itself uses the stories or phrases he has already heard from absolutely different people received during a conversation, news or other, another of the features is the numerous personalities of Steven.\n\nI am creating this project because I have long wanted to try to tell people that being yourself is the most difficult and wonderful feeling. My goal is to get an animated movie adaptation on Netflix, the script will be written by anyone who wants to participate in the community. \n\nPeace be with you all!",

There are 6 types of buildings and structures such as windmills and water towers and multiple houses with different structures and styles in this artwork. There are various arrangements and color palettes based on different times of the day.\n\nTo see the artwork in full size, It's highly recommended to open it in live mode.\n\nYou can save the artwork by pressing 's' in live view after render was completed.",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "This project began as an exploration of how human beings across all sorts of cultures respond in remarkably similar ways in terms of associating sounds with shapes.  That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",

These creases form the boundaries of the individual textured tiles.\n\nOnce the folds are complete, they are undone in reverse order, recreating the original plane.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",

We're here for our families, our friends, and our community. Like everything in life, there are joyful times and challenging times. We must accept happiness as something that is not constant but that we feel at times (a \"tratti\" in Italian).\n\nWith \"tratti\", we want to send a message to every disheartened human being: \"Stay strong and never let anyone or anything crush the hope in you.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s.

There are 6 types of buildings and structures such as windmills and water towers and multiple houses with different structures and styles in this artwork. There are various arrangements and color palettes based on different times of the day.\n\nTo see the artwork in full size, It's highly recommended to open it in live mode.\n\nYou can save the artwork by pressing 's' in live view after render was completed.",
