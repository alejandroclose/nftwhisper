We as humans have a need to leave traces - stories - that others can read and learn from. What will be the traces machines want to leave? This piece employs sinusoidal signals drawn with lines as a simple metaphor for every trace and every language, for every message and every communication.\n\necologías-A is an entity that is part of a broader ecology. Released on occasion of the show \"Unbound - Ecology in the Age of Machines\" at Unit London. The data generated by this entity is read by a different piece minted on Ethereum, creating a link between Tezos and Ethereum, a metaphor for an ecology of blockchains.\n\nit shares a common element with two other works released on fxhash: ecologías B and ecologías C, all of them contributing data to aforementioned pieces.\n\nread more at https://www.iillucid.com/ecologias\n\n15% of primary sales are donated to institutions working towards improving biodiversity and environmental efforts.\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nBuilt on p5.js, glsl\n\nappend &pd=N (N a number) to the URL in live view to increase/decrease resolution\npress s to save current image in current resolution\npress z,x,g,b,n followed by +/- to increase/decrease, respectively, brightness, contrast, gamma, blur, noise",

As machines enter into our societies - our ecologies - we may think what would be like a society of machines only. What are portraits of said machines without us humans around? Will they want to seek for their individual character, much like we do? It will depend on their personalities, their will, their intent, their traumas... their versions of all of this. We shall need to understand what their motivations will be like - what the potential basis for their potential version of a potential conscience is and how it will evolve. Only through a good understanding of diversity can we reach a functioning system.
