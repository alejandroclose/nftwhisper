            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

(...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

            "description": "Among the thousands of different types of natural ecosystems, we come across some that are more bizarre than others and have particular characteristics. They might also be imposing most of the time to us as a misty forest that contains plenty of diverse habitats. \n\nThe point with these beautiful is that they are too complex ecosystems because they're formed by numerous tree layers. Since these forests that consist of different types of trees develop in areas laden with water vapor or dew at the flora level, the degree of sun exposure is reduced, which makes the evaporation of water by plants much lower. \n\nAfter this information about the misty/foggy forests, I wanted to give the name called 'Rudeneja' which describes the way nature and/or the weather begins to feel like Autumn. I've tried to achieve that by creating a dense layer of trees, fog, grasses, and leaves. Also, the blur effect I've applied after all layers gives a nice depth effect in the composition. Each different color spot for the element of the piece translates the art's structure to a possible iteration. The features of the project are below, you can review and try them through the variations. \n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Back Trees Density: Very low-26%, Low-6%, Medium-7%, High-9%, Very High-52%\n- Big Tree: true-89%, false-11%\n- Leaves: true-29%, false-71%\n- Back Trees Type: Poplar-16%, Elm-9%, Sycamore-12%, Eucalyptus-11%, Dogwood-9%, Horse Chestnut-15%, Serviceberry-13%, Ginkgo Biloba-11%\n- Big Tree Type: Poplar-11%, Elm-10%, Sycamore-8%, Eucalyptus-9%, Dogwood-14%, Horse Chestnut-17%, Serviceberry-18%, Ginkgo Biloba-13%\n- Gray Scale: true-17%, false-83%\n- Fog Density: Very Low-17%, Low-14%, Medium-17%, High-23%, Very High-29%\n- Grass Colors: Absolute Dark-26%, Ebony Clay-13.5%, Rosy Brown-4.5%, Black Olive-9%, Black Eel-5.25%, Crater Brown-6.75%, Cork-6%, Bleached Cedar-3.75%, Night-7.5%, Gray-15.75%\n- Sky Colors: Gray-26%, Dark Blue-%9, Bordeaux-6.75%, Dark Sienna-5.25, Dark Blue Gray-6.75%, Tuna-6%, Asphalt-4.5%, Light Burgundy-5.25%, Clear Blur-4.5%, Black Bean-6.75, Bean Red-4.5%, Light Green-6.5%\n- Leaves Colors: Black-26%, Night-10.5%, Blur Charcoal-6.75%, Jaguar-7.5%, Wood Bark-6.75%, Sepia Black-10.5%, Dried Blood-14.25%, Dark Teal-8.25%\n- Fog Colors: Gray-27%, Lavender Pinocchio-11%, Link Water-10%, Pale Aqua-13%, Blossom-13%, Summer Green-13%, Jungle Mist-13%\n- Light Direction: Left-38%, Right-41%, Behind-21%\n\n\nPress 's' to export a 2000x3000 png file in live mode.\n\nThe project was tested on desktop Chrome 105.0.5195.127, Mozilla 104.0.2, and Edge 105.0.1343.42 versions.\n\nMade with p5js.\n\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0 LICENSE\n\nSeptember 2022 / Rhaegar",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "This is an algorithmic tribute to the pioneering work of Anna Atkins (1799-1871). Considered by many the first female photographer, Atkins learned about the cyanotype process soon after it was invented by John Herschel, a family friend. As a botanist, she had the idea of using the new technique to produce contact prints of plants. Her investigations succeeded in capturing the nuances in morphology and the delicate details of many species.\n\nIn 1843 she published “British Algae: Cyanotype impressions”, the first published book to use a photographic process for the illustrations. Each copy gathered around 400 prints, each of them individually produced from a different specimen. Thus, all books featured the same species, but each of them was different, in a process that was itself generative in a certain way. Today, about 17 copies of the book are preserved in different institutions. Atkins went on to publish two more books in the following years, with the help of her friend Anne Dixon, dedicated to various ferns and plants.\n\n“Cyanotypes” pays homage to her wonderful work, which sits at the intersection between science and art, and used technology in a novel way to capture the beauty of nature. Here things are taken one step forward, to generate algorithmic simulations of plants, ferns, and algae, which are the work of fantasy and not necessarily faithful to the traits of any real species.\n\nThe work features 28 basic configurations, each of them in turn capable of unlimited variations. As was the case with the prints from “British Algae”, every image is at the same time part of a series and unique. \n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 800 x 1000 resolution. Please note that rendering at high resolutions can be very slow.\n\nMade with p5.js. \n",

            "description": "Among the thousands of different types of natural ecosystems, we come across some that are more bizarre than others and have particular characteristics. They might also be imposing most of the time to us as a misty forest that contains plenty of diverse habitats. \n\nThe point with these beautiful is that they are too complex ecosystems because they're formed by numerous tree layers. Since these forests that consist of different types of trees develop in areas laden with water vapor or dew at the flora level, the degree of sun exposure is reduced, which makes the evaporation of water by plants much lower. \n\nAfter this information about the misty/foggy forests, I wanted to give the name called 'Rudeneja' which describes the way nature and/or the weather begins to feel like Autumn. I've tried to achieve that by creating a dense layer of trees, fog, grasses, and leaves. Also, the blur effect I've applied after all layers gives a nice depth effect in the composition. Each different color spot for the element of the piece translates the art's structure to a possible iteration. The features of the project are below, you can review and try them through the variations. \n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Back Trees Density: Very low-26%, Low-6%, Medium-7%, High-9%, Very High-52%\n- Big Tree: true-89%, false-11%\n- Leaves: true-29%, false-71%\n- Back Trees Type: Poplar-16%, Elm-9%, Sycamore-12%, Eucalyptus-11%, Dogwood-9%, Horse Chestnut-15%, Serviceberry-13%, Ginkgo Biloba-11%\n- Big Tree Type: Poplar-11%, Elm-10%, Sycamore-8%, Eucalyptus-9%, Dogwood-14%, Horse Chestnut-17%, Serviceberry-18%, Ginkgo Biloba-13%\n- Gray Scale: true-17%, false-83%\n- Fog Density: Very Low-17%, Low-14%, Medium-17%, High-23%, Very High-29%\n- Grass Colors: Absolute Dark-26%, Ebony Clay-13.5%, Rosy Brown-4.5%, Black Olive-9%, Black Eel-5.25%, Crater Brown-6.75%, Cork-6%, Bleached Cedar-3.75%, Night-7.5%, Gray-15.75%\n- Sky Colors: Gray-26%, Dark Blue-%9, Bordeaux-6.75%, Dark Sienna-5.25, Dark Blue Gray-6.75%, Tuna-6%, Asphalt-4.5%, Light Burgundy-5.25%, Clear Blur-4.5%, Black Bean-6.75, Bean Red-4.5%, Light Green-6.5%\n- Leaves Colors: Black-26%, Night-10.5%, Blur Charcoal-6.75%, Jaguar-7.5%, Wood Bark-6.75%, Sepia Black-10.5%, Dried Blood-14.25%, Dark Teal-8.25%\n- Fog Colors: Gray-27%, Lavender Pinocchio-11%, Link Water-10%, Pale Aqua-13%, Blossom-13%, Summer Green-13%, Jungle Mist-13%\n- Light Direction: Left-38%, Right-41%, Behind-21%\n\n\nPress 's' to export a 2000x3000 png file in live mode.\n\nThe project was tested on desktop Chrome 105.0.5195.127, Mozilla 104.0.2, and Edge 105.0.1343.42 versions.\n\nMade with p5js.\n\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0 LICENSE\n\nSeptember 2022 / Rhaegar",
