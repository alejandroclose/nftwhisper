            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "The Corium is a roughly spherical mass (diameter ~1km), of currently unknown origins situated within the core region of the solar system's asteroid belt.\nThe body was discovered during a uranium extraction mission undertaken by ET Resources at the behest of Station 733-H (Mars colony) leadership, when ionising radiation levels detected by deployed surface craft exceeded equipment and personnel tolerance levels by many orders of magnitude.\n\nWhile ETR crew were quick to respond to local abort orders (27 minutes from initial readings to fleet reorientation); Station 733-H made the determination that radiation exposure levels were already far in excess of anything that could be reasonably mitigated upon the ETR fleet's return.\nThe ETR fleet was ordered to jettison fuel reserves under Section 9 of the Space Corporations Act (Mars) approximately 90 minutes after the readings were initially reported. It is understood that all deployed personnel accessed their barbiturate rations within the following 24 hours.\n\nThe fleet itself remains in position some ~3000kms from The Corium, with plans to relocate the vessels still underway (albeit a low priority).\n\n\nSTATION 733-H OBSERVATION REPORT SUMMARY (14.1.1)\n\nTo date, remote analysis suggests that the body is compositionally similar to corium deposits observed following terrestrial nuclear disasters, consisting of a range of solidified radioactive compounds as well as a number of currently unidentified metal alloys. More in-depth analysis has been impossible to date due to the rapid physical decay of personnel and equipment as their proximity to samples reach a critical threshold.\n\nAll samples have so far been extruded from the surface of The Corium via laser, and maneuvered into orbit around Mars at the edge of it's sphere of influence (at a distance of no less than 50,000kms from Station 733-H), via projectile barrage and gas envelopment.\n\nThe surface of The Corium itself is littered with an array of clearly engineered forms; radial and rectangular patterns, deep crevasses, mazes and grids with only a select few areas resembling the pools of lava observed where Corium has formed terrestrially (it is unclear whether these deposits have formed since the surface was initially engineered).\n\nThe accompanying files are LIDAR renders of the extracted samples in proximity to Station 733-H and are marked for dissemination to terrestrial research teams on Mars. Study of The Corium remains the sole priority of Station 733-H research personnel, as any risks presented to the solar system or its inhabitants are currently not well understood.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe piece will render from the top right and might take ~5-10 seconds to begin.\n\nAppend \"&print=true\" to the live render URL for a hi-res output.",

            "description": "‘For the artist communication with nature remains the most essential condition. The artist is human, himself nature; part of nature within natural space.’ (Paul Klee, 1944) \n\n\nWorking on long-form nature has an interesting side effect. On the one hand, you're attempting a shallow imitation of a landscape.... You are working with cold logic and code, vainly trying to control randomness to create this virtual facsimile, something you know is artificial.... \n\n....and yet.... even with all this left-brain activity, your right-brain pushes back, and imagines being there. While working on this project I found myself continually daydreaming, wandering off to hear the sounds of waterfalls, or the crunch of walking along a sandy lake shore. If you've ever wondered about coding, I urge you to learn. Daydreams await....\n\n\nPress '1' once rendering is finished, to redraw at 5120x5120 resolution \nPress '2' to export without post-processing effects \n\n3rd party libraries (license text and links included in source) \n- p5.js - Creative coding framework \n- JS Topology Suite \"JSTS\", a port of Java Topology Suite \"JTS\" - High-level Geometry library \n- WebGLImageFilter, Dominic Szablewski - phoboslab.org \n\nI have tried to use soft blurs and shadows to give a sense of layering and depth to the scene. After viewing for a while, it reminds me of 3D paper-art. There are traits for colour and amount of birds, waterfalls, etc. but none are especially rare – These properties are intended for filtering the collection.  ",

The artist is human, himself nature; part of nature within natural space.’ (Paul Klee, 1944) \n\n\nWorking on long-form nature has an interesting side effect. On the one hand, you're attempting a shallow imitation of a landscape.... You are working with cold logic and code, vainly trying to control randomness to create this virtual facsimile, something you know is artificial.... \n\n....and yet.... even with all this left-brain activity, your right-brain pushes back, and imagines being there. While working on this project I found myself continually daydreaming, wandering off to hear the sounds of waterfalls, or the crunch of walking along a sandy lake shore. If you've ever wondered about coding, I urge you to learn. Daydreams await....\n\n\nPress '1' once rendering is finished, to redraw at 5120x5120 resolution \nPress '2' to export without post-processing effects \n\n3rd party libraries (license text and links included in source) \n- p5.js - Creative coding framework \n- JS Topology Suite \"JSTS\", a port of Java Topology Suite \"JTS\" - High-level Geometry library \n- WebGLImageFilter, Dominic Szablewski - phoboslab.org \n\nI have tried to use soft blurs and shadows to give a sense of layering and depth to the scene. After viewing for a while, it reminds me of 3D paper-art. There are traits for colour and amount of birds, waterfalls, etc. but none are especially rare – These properties are intended for filtering the collection.  ",
