You are the land. \nThere are waves on the shore, and the waves are slices.\n\nGazing at the slices, you feel the coldness of the Arctic Ocean, the permafrost of the Antarctic Sea, the deep darkness of the bottomless sea.\n\nStay silent, hear the sound of the waves lapping at the innumerable shores far away.\nFeel the soul of the digital ocean.\n\nInteractivities:\n> Key P: Pause\n> Key S: Save\n> Press and move mouseX: wave moves slower / faster\n\nChe-Yu Wu",

            "description": "Looking at a motherboard seems like leaning over a busy city. Underneath the dense buildings (the components) runs at speed of electric fields an intricate transportation network that would drive any of our most practiced commuters crazy.\nDesigning circuit boards has been my job for a while. In addition to the technical approach I've come to deeply appreciate their aesthetical quality. The bond with generative art was striking to me.\n\nThe core code for \"Bright Circuits\" is a strict transcription of the rules at work when routing circuit tracks, i.e they can make 45° or 90° turns, they must respect a security gap between each other, and above all, they must never overlap. When the routing problem has no solution, we solve it by adding another layer of tracks, which communicates through soldered drill holes (Bright Circuits can have up to 3 layers).\n\nAt this point, the engineer in me got carried away by the art. As I was evolving from function to form, I started to imagine that the tracks where lifeforms driven by natural impulses, in an attempt to reach either freedom or a higher level of collective consciousness.\nDespite the advent of AI we know that something that still differentiates the human from the machine is the ability to both feel, and conceptualise the feeling ; the free will and the ability for undeterministic decisioning.\n\nCircuit tracks have managed to escape their boxed fate and arrange in shapes such as a circle, a heart, a skull (the components of a Vanity).\nThey now seek the experience of feeling. They have comprehended that feeling comes in a large palette of possibilities. Bright tracks are attracted to light (or positive moods), while dark tracks are running away from it (dark moods). The mix of both movements reflects the complexity of human feeling, which translates into a large variety of visual patterns.\nOccasionally, they will go as far as outpassing their fundamental electronics rules and display a breakthrough creative mindset through features called \"artistic rebellion\" and \"cartesian rebellion\". \"Bright Circuits\" will also communicate through a pair of human words their clumsy attempt at feeling and doubting.\n\n\n- press [s] in live view to export a PNG image file, between 9 and 8000 pixels wide.\n- press [enter] to stop the animation and go straight to the result\n\nCode in Vanilla Javascript + CSS\n\n10% of the royalties are for minters",

            "description": "Looking at a motherboard seems like leaning over a busy city. Underneath the dense buildings (the components) runs at speed of electric fields an intricate transportation network that would drive any of our most practiced commuters crazy.\nDesigning circuit boards has been my job for a while. In addition to the technical approach I've come to deeply appreciate their aesthetical quality. The bond with generative art was striking to me.\n\nThe core code for \"Bright Circuits\" is a strict transcription of the rules at work when routing circuit tracks, i.e they can make 45° or 90° turns, they must respect a security gap between each other, and above all, they must never overlap. When the routing problem has no solution, we solve it by adding another layer of tracks, which communicates through soldered drill holes (Bright Circuits can have up to 3 layers).\n\nAt this point, the engineer in me got carried away by the art. As I was evolving from function to form, I started to imagine that the tracks where lifeforms driven by natural impulses, in an attempt to reach either freedom or a higher level of collective consciousness.\nDespite the advent of AI we know that something that still differentiates the human from the machine is the ability to both feel, and conceptualise the feeling ; the free will and the ability for undeterministic decisioning.\n\nCircuit tracks have managed to escape their boxed fate and arrange in shapes such as a circle, a heart, a skull (the components of a Vanity).\nThey now seek the experience of feeling. They have comprehended that feeling comes in a large palette of possibilities. Bright tracks are attracted to light (or positive moods), while dark tracks are running away from it (dark moods). The mix of both movements reflects the complexity of human feeling, which translates into a large variety of visual patterns.\nOccasionally, they will go as far as outpassing their fundamental electronics rules and display a breakthrough creative mindset through features called \"artistic rebellion\" and \"cartesian rebellion\". \"Bright Circuits\" will also communicate through a pair of human words their clumsy attempt at feeling and doubting.\n\n\n- press [s] in live view to export a PNG image file, between 9 and 8000 pixels wide.\n- press [enter] to stop the animation and go straight to the result\n\nCode in Vanilla Javascript + CSS\n\n10% of the royalties are for minters",

Inspired by Wiederrecht’s mastery of line and Vittoria’s notable palette, this 1/1/250 series captures the present moment.

            "description": "“In Due Time” is a collaborative generative collection between artists Melissa Wiederrecht and Amber Vittoria. Inspired by Wiederrecht’s mastery of line and Vittoria’s notable palette, this 1/1/250 series captures the present moment. It serves as a reminder that we are more similar than we are different, leveraging homogeneous shapes to create distinctive compositions.\n\nVittoria’s poem for the collection:\n\n“In Due Time”\nWe will all become\nParticles dancing\nAcross the skyline.\n\nThe artwork listed is indeed authentic, created by, and copyright to artists Melissa Wiederrecht and Amber Vittoria; the purchase of this NFT is a purchase of the asset, not of the copyright.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTo save a high-resolution image for printing, click “open” under the image on the page for your token, and then hit:\n\nDigits “1” through “9” to get an image that is 1000 through 9000px tall.  This may take a while, depending on the size and your computer, so please be patient.",

Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",
