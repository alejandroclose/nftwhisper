The fact is that, according to a few millennia of research, there are a limited number of distinct human emotions, predefined by the human psyche. Sometimes it may seem like we are experiencing a \"new\" one, but on closer inspection, we see that it is the known emotions that are superimposed. Emotions are what they are, and they exist in the same way in each of us, whether we recognize them for what they are or not. But as our history blends into a new emerging state of the world, a whole new range of emotional responses are triggered within us. An infinite maelstrom of variations generated from a simple combination of a few emotions.\n\n\nControls :\n\n‚Ä¢ Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nInland Emotions by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

Each work is created within one of three modes, Part, Counterpart, or Part:Counterpart.\n\nIn experimenting, I've enjoyed taking a simple composition and breaking it down with various methods. This transforms the original composition into something new, but it also begins to lose what the original had to say. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I want to dive a little deeper and explore ideas as a sort of tangible substance. Already we're comparing ideas against their translations and evolutions, but what happens if we present them both within the context of the other?\n\nAdditionally, what if we present both of these ideas with echoes and tangents, discussion around the ideas and their practical applications instead of imagined? Sure, these aren't our idea, or even our translation, but they exist only because the originals do.\n\nHow does this change our opinion of the original? Is every idea destined to be picked apart and reimagined forever until it bears only a faint resemblance? Where is the line between our Counterpart and an echo?\n\nThis piece hopes to inspire contemplation on the nature of storytelling and artistic inspiration.\n\n10% of ideas are encrypted to obscure the original Part.\nPress ‚Äôs‚Äô to save a 3600x4500 png.\nPress ‚Äòp‚Äô to save the original Part, pure and untouched.",

            "description": "The title of the work is a paraphrase of Ren√© Magritte's famous work. In today's world, the irony embedded in it is wrapped up in a new way. How can we tell one from the other, such as natural from natural, if they look the same or perform the same functions?\nI was inspired to create branches by the news of the development of mechanical trees that can capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These cyborgs are able to do the job much more efficiently than their natural counterparts. Soon there will be an entire forest of mechanical plants in Arizona.\nThe mechanical trunks are tall columns, 1.5 metres in diameter, which are made up of discs, just like the stem of the mechanical-digital branch in this work. It is capable of twisting and taking a variety of forms, from entirely natural to more angular, industrial, mechanistic ones. Where does the fine line between our recognition of a living organism and an artificial one pass, does it exist and will it be important to us in the future?\n\nThe palettes are taken from Japanese prints celebrating the beauty of nature.\nPlus there is a vaporwave palette that reminds me of the game Metal Mutant, the aesthetics of which I was fascinated with as a child.\n\nMade with p5.js code\nTo save the image, press the 's' key.

            "description": "INSPIRATION\n\nSpirali was inspired by Tyler Hobbs' work with flow fields. However, instead of selecting random starting points for each shape to be drawn, which is more usual in flow fields works, I wanted to constrain the starting points to certain positions so that the shape being drawn could expand freely without the risk of colliding with other shapes, that's when I got to the spiral flow field.\n\nWHY SPIRALI?\n\nThe name of this collection is not only a direct translation of spirals in Italian, but it is also related to Italian cuisine and my own personal experience in Italy. The relationship with Italian cuisine is due to the immense number of types of pasta that exist, including one called spirali. When I was a child I only knew three or four types of pasta, but when I became a bit older I was amazed to learn that there were many more. Actually, there are hundreds. Just like from the same type of basic dough, you can make hundreds of types of pasta, my idea was, from just one type of spiral flow field, to make hundreds of images. A strategy of forcing creativity by imposing a major constraint.\n\nThe name of this collection also relates to my personal experience because it was visiting Italy many years ago that I first became interested in art and design because of the beautiful buildings, churches and works of art that I came across.\n\nDESIGN STRATEGY\n\nA spirali is made up of several tails and each tail is made up of a basic element, which I called slice. A tail may have from one to thousands slices. It is mainly the variation in the number of slices and how they are colored that creates the different tail styles in each spirali.\n\nThe slices start at the center of the spiral and in each iteration they grow a certain length or split in two depending on the parameters used in the algorithm, which also determine the outline and fill of each slice when it is rendered.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe main features that a spirali can have are:\n\n- Styles: Refers to the drawing patterns of each tail, that means, the shape, fill and stroke of the slices that form the tail. There are about 16 possible styles from which the algorithm will choose about 3 for each spirali.\n\n- Zoom out: It is related to how much larger the flow field area is in comparison to the image area. There are two possibilities: 50% and 100%.\n\n- Curvature: An arbitrary measure of the rate the tails of a spirali are turning. A spirali can have high or low curvature.\n\n- Rotation: The rotation direction: clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n- Tails: The number of tails in a spirali.\n\n- Palette: The palette's name. There are about 14 possible palettes.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n\n- Press \"m\" to export a medium resolution image (2000px x 2000px);\n- Press \"h\" to export a high resolution image (6000px x 6000px);\n\nLICENSING\n\nPlease see license.txt file.\n\nTwitter: @PauloSilvaGArt\nSite: https://paulosilva.art",

            "description": "Inland Emotions\n\nOver the centuries, ancient philosophers and modern psychologists have come to the same basic conclusion. The fact is that, according to a few millennia of research, there are a limited number of distinct human emotions, predefined by the human psyche. Sometimes it may seem like we are experiencing a \"new\" one, but on closer inspection, we see that it is the known emotions that are superimposed. Emotions are what they are, and they exist in the same way in each of us, whether we recognize them for what they are or not. But as our history blends into a new emerging state of the world, a whole new range of emotional responses are triggered within us. An infinite maelstrom of variations generated from a simple combination of a few emotions.\n\n\nControls :\n\n‚Ä¢ Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nInland Emotions by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",
