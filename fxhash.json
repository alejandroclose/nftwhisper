            "description": "This project began as an exploration of how human beings across all sorts of cultures respond in remarkably similar ways in terms of associating sounds with shapes.  That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens —created in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco— that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking “what if” questions such as “What if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?” Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road —one direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature— it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario’s thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",

            "description": "This project began as an exploration of how human beings across all sorts of cultures respond in remarkably similar ways in terms of associating sounds with shapes.  That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",
