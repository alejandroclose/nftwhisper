            "description": "In the creation of \"Asta,\" a tapestry of mathematical precision and mythological grandeur unfolds before the viewer. The name itself is an ode to the Old Norse term \"Ástríðr,\" which combines \"ás,\" or the divine, with \"fríðr,\" the beautiful. Much like the gods and goddesses of Norse mythology, \"Asta\" dwells in a space where disparate forces like unity and fragmentation or chaos and order find harmony.\n\nThe visual core of the artwork is composed of concentric circles meticulously shaped from individual spheres. Each circle, akin to the realms over which Norse gods presided, is a universe unto itself, yet all function as part of an overarching cosmic design. The deities of Norse lore were complex beings, embodying both virtues and flaws, and such dualities reverberate through each sphere and orbit within the piece.\n\nServing as a backdrop for this celestial assembly is a canvas marked by signs of distress and decay. This reflects the concept of entropy inherent in Norse cosmology—often symbolized by the serpent Jormungandr biting its own tail to form a circle. Circles that appear to have lost their center drift aimlessly, reminiscent of gods who have fallen from grace, thereby capturing the unpredictable and imperfect nature of existence.\n\n\"Asta\" is not merely a visual spectacle; it's an invitation to embark on a philosophical exploration. As viewers traverse the delicate balance between intricate patterns and intentional anomalies, they are compelled to confront the eternal dualities symbolized in Norse mythology—such as order and chaos, the finite and the infinite, and the divine and the mortal.\n\nFor those who engage with it, \"Asta\" serves as more than just an art piece. It becomes a poetic meeting with the sublime and a tribute to the complexities that both life and mythology bestow upon the human experience.\n\nControls\n========\nThe controls are as follows:\n- Press `t` - 370 x 200 png output (thumbnail)\n- Press `1` - 650 x 1200 png output\n- Press `2` - 1300 x 2400 png output\n- Press `3` - 1950 x 3600 png output\n- Press `4` - 3250 x 6000 png output\n- Press `5` - 5200 x 9600 png output\n- Press `6` - 7800 x 14400 png output\n\nPlease note that the larger the output, the longer it will take to generate.",

            "description": "In the creation of \"Asta,\" a tapestry of mathematical precision and mythological grandeur unfolds before the viewer. The name itself is an ode to the Old Norse term \"Ástríðr,\" which combines \"ás,\" or the divine, with \"fríðr,\" the beautiful. Much like the gods and goddesses of Norse mythology, \"Asta\" dwells in a space where disparate forces like unity and fragmentation or chaos and order find harmony.\n\nThe visual core of the artwork is composed of concentric circles meticulously shaped from individual spheres. Each circle, akin to the realms over which Norse gods presided, is a universe unto itself, yet all function as part of an overarching cosmic design. The deities of Norse lore were complex beings, embodying both virtues and flaws, and such dualities reverberate through each sphere and orbit within the piece.\n\nServing as a backdrop for this celestial assembly is a canvas marked by signs of distress and decay. This reflects the concept of entropy inherent in Norse cosmology—often symbolized by the serpent Jormungandr biting its own tail to form a circle. Circles that appear to have lost their center drift aimlessly, reminiscent of gods who have fallen from grace, thereby capturing the unpredictable and imperfect nature of existence.\n\n\"Asta\" is not merely a visual spectacle; it's an invitation to embark on a philosophical exploration. As viewers traverse the delicate balance between intricate patterns and intentional anomalies, they are compelled to confront the eternal dualities symbolized in Norse mythology—such as order and chaos, the finite and the infinite, and the divine and the mortal.\n\nFor those who engage with it, \"Asta\" serves as more than just an art piece. It becomes a poetic meeting with the sublime and a tribute to the complexities that both life and mythology bestow upon the human experience.\n\nControls\n========\nThe controls are as follows:\n- Press `t` - 370 x 200 png output (thumbnail)\n- Press `1` - 650 x 1200 png output\n- Press `2` - 1300 x 2400 png output\n- Press `3` - 1950 x 3600 png output\n- Press `4` - 3250 x 6000 png output\n- Press `5` - 5200 x 9600 png output\n- Press `6` - 7800 x 14400 png output\n\nPlease note that the larger the output, the longer it will take to generate.",
