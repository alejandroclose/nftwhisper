            "description": "This series is about finding the beauty in discarded things. It's about seeing the potential for art in the most unexpected places and creating something new from what already exists.\n\nOne thing we love about art is that it can be a direct expression of our thoughts and feelings. But what about the happy accidents that can happen when we let go and allow the materials to guide us?\n\nI love the serendipitous moments that arise when I relinquish control, letting the materials show me the way. The printmaking process can be messy and unpredictable. I often use sheets of notebook paper to keep my workspace clean. When I’m done, I save some of the scrap sheets of paper. \n\nThe mark of a dirty brayer, drips of paint, a coffee stain, or a ripped edge can all be embraced as part of the final composition. A similar process happens in generative art, where projects can have near limitless possibilities.\n\nSheets of paper can represent many things: a blank slate, an adventure, or even noise. This project is dedicated to all the leftovers and forgotten things in the world. It's a reminder that even the smallest piece of paper can be beautiful.",

            "description": "Mountains throughout human history have taken on deep meanings. Coated with immense sacredness by all peoples in the most different places. Being them as a representation of God himself or being the object of worship. For many the mountains were the very abode of the Gods. They are in the collective unconscious as the ability to connect men and gods, through the flow of energy between earth and heaven.\n\nThe symbology is very strong. It unconsciously reminds us of the process of encounter between the loneliness of the earth and the hope of the sky, between the fog that blinds and the cloud that supports, between the abyss of the ground and the proximity of the stars. All this is very charming and fascinating.\n\nAll human beings have their own mountain, which demands from each one their limits to reach the top, the desire for the breathtaking view, the fear of falling, but also the hope of the last step at the highest point.\n\nIn generative art it couldn't be different, going through all the learning, from its fundamentals, to all the countless hours of tests, to countless moments of problem solving and research and more research. This whole process is without a doubt like climbing a mountain. Thinking about the project is exactly like looking at a mountain and imagining how exhausting it will be all the way to conquer it. Finishing your work is like breathing a sigh of relief, looking down and seeing how hard it was to get there, but at the same time looking ahead and realizing how rewarding it was to be able to have that vision and breathe the refreshing breeze of the moment.\n\nAfter going through a transformation in my first work, where I transmuted my artistic essence from illustration to generative art. Now I come to this second work that I delved into, and after months of climbing this mountain of mine, I give it to you.\n\n\n- Press \"S\" in live view mode after loading to save at 1600x1600px.\n\nlicense: \nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nproject website:\nhttps://playman.me/projectmountain\n",

For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

            "description": "\"Junina\" is a tribute to the June popular festivities in Brazil, when the streets and house facades are decorated on many cities, mainly on the Northeast Region of the country. Small flags, paper balloons, and lamps are hung on public space creating a very special atmosphere and colorful landscapes. \n\nPlenty of forró (traditional music), bonfires, fireworks, typical food and drinks are part of these festivities that celebrate rural popular culture. The “Festas Juninas” (June festivities) have an important affective place in the imaginary of the Brazilian population. \n\n\"Junina\" continues the experimentations with code of my previous work \"Monotipia\". The challenge of creating graphic compositions with simple elements remains. Searching and trying to delve deeper into ways to play with the rhythm and subtleties of transparencies, colors, shapes and textures.\n\nThis project is also an homage to the painters who made the Brazilian June festivities as the theme of their works, especially Alfredo Volpi (1896-1988) and Alberto da Veiga Guignard (1896-1962), but also Anita Malfatti (1889-1964), Emiliano Di Cavalcanti (1897-1976), Heitor dos Prazeres (1898-1966), and many others.\n\n---\nFeatures:\n-> 8 palettes (rarest = grayscale)\n-> 9 compositions\n-> Elements: 6 geometric shapes OR mixed element compositions\n-> 5 canvas formats: \n-----> tall portrait (9:16)\n-----> portrait (2:3)\n-----> square (1:1)\n-----> landscape (3:2)\n-----> wide landscape (16:9) = rarest\n-> Border colors: \n-----> soft\n-----> dark\n-----> deep gray\n-----> soberest color from palette\n-----> random color from palette (rarest)\n\n* The names of the color palettes are words related to popular June festivals. The decision to use untranslated expressions was made because these words carry many poetic meanings in Portuguese. For example, \"cinza\" means \"gray\" but also \"ash\". A word that refers to both the color and to the residue that results from burning wood in bonfires.\n\n---\nTo save the image as a png file, type:\n[1] save at actual size \n[2] save with 2000px height\n[3] save with 3000px height\n[4] save with 4000px height\n[5] save with 5000px height\n\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n---\nCreated with p5.js\n\n---\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2023\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada",

After that, you can shout as loud as you want and take a deep breath.\nYou can see the colors more clearly now, green, red, blue, everything is brightly colored and arranged.\nDon't worry, I didn't forget my canvas.\nIn any case, I want to see the world like this, full of colors, the way I want ...\nThis time I want to draw the mountains blue, the grass red, and the sun pink.\nIt is not my strength to draw everything accurately since I am not a painting master! I paint as I please, just with a brush and my canvas..\nThis time I want to be free..\nWhen I first had this idea, I thought I would need hundreds, perhaps thousands of canvases! Or how many colors will be enough to allow me to depict the vastness of my imagination in it?\nDoes a forest still exist that can be painted?\nWhat about the rivers? Do they still flow?\nThere are a lot of questions I don't know the answer to!\nNo matter what happened, I am me, and maybe I should put a dot on the canvas and use all the colors, Maybe just one color and millions of lines..\nit's our world..\nWe paint a world where we can be free, as we please, on our canvas.\n\ns = save",
