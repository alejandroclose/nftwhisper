            "description": "Everything is divisible. Larger organisms are made up of smaller ones, entire galaxies are comprised of stars, planets, people, dust, and one effect here and now ripples into eternity. Nothing exists without the elemental components that have evolved to make them possible — and nothing on the plane of existence arrives in isolation from something greater. This enmeshed reality is the concept of a Holon: a whole that is simultaneously part of another whole. \n\nAs cells, energies, beings, and ideas grow in complexity, each new advancement includes and transcends their holons, the very catalysts of evolution. What does this essential process look like on its own when scale, context, and definition are removed? The senses are forced to purely observe the present interactions and reactions that occur between all parts. This is what Holons attempts to portray — the witnessing of birth, formation, and crystallization simultaneously. \n\nUpon viewing each piece and inspecting its detail with curiosity — we can observe living reality that has been temporarily suspended from motion and artificially stopped for us to witness. Can we see what is a part, and what is a whole? Can we define what these holons are? \n\nLet each Holons remind us that the impossible can always be made; let each one be nothing and everything — organisms, cosmos, energy itself — all at once, for it’s the creation of something entirely new that best reminds us that everything is actually made of the parts already here. So, remember to create without barriers or limitations because reality itself is made of that which lives now only in imagination.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x flight404\nOctober 2022\n\nPress ‘h’ in live view to render a high resolution version of any token.\nPress ‘s’ in live view to save a .png of the current view of any token.\n\nHolons was created in vanilla Javascript and WebGL, but the majority of the work was done in GLSL shaders. This setup was substantially assisted by fx(hash) community leader and artist Liam Egan who provided technical assistance and emotional support during the project's lifespan. For this reason, we have included him in the split of proceeds.\n",

            "description": "This project is a playful attempt to depict how Neo-plasticism painters abstracted compositions, inspired and a tribute to the \"De Stijl\" movement, drawn using statically rendered block elements. The visual language reminds the original designs of famous artists of this art movement; in this project, each color palette is categorized by the name of a favorite piece of these artists. These palettes are sometimes determined by the color combination of this artist's works, which form the visual identity of their works from the color dimension.\nIn this project, different nodes are simple orthogonal shapes of color spots and thin lines to demarcate colors. I tried to create a dynamic effect by questioning the usual signs of vision in the abstract works of this period, to modify the relationship between them profoundly, and to show another field of my understanding of this movement by drawing a personal space.\nThe colors red, black, blue, and yellow were used from this turning point in the Neo-plasticism that the artists of the 'De Stijl movement cared about.\nSubtle black lines separate the vast rectangles, which for some are filled with bright or black, or gray; each small component is a member to create a whole and a single visualization, and each aspect of the components receives its visual value from the whole.\nThis work has set 27 color palettes and three variations to shape different rarities. It is better to set the browser to standard mode to see the effect better.\n\nDe Stijl\n \nThe style \"De Stijl\" of the Dutch avant-garde movement is an essential key to understanding the sources of the modern movement. The movement is organized around three central figures: the painter Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg and the furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld. Other core members are the painters Bart van der Leck, Georges Vantongerlo, and Willmus Huzar; the architects J.J.P Oud, Robert van Hoff, and Jan Wills; the poet Anthony Cook, later the graphic designer Piet Zwart and the architect Cornelis van Stern.\nIn 1918, a year after the official founding of the group and publication of the magazine's first issue that published and publicized the movement's doctrine, the creators of De Stijl combined the aesthetic and social vision. The group's first manifesto calls for a new balance between the individual and the universal and fights to free art from the limitations of the cult of individualism. \n \nDe Stijl originates both in the Hegelian tradition and in the Theosophical movement, then spreading in the Netherlands, both a utopian vision and a commitment to the production of the reality of the industrial world. However, it is a formal, plastic, pictorial, or architectural transcription of the principles of universal harmony that its creators implement. Painting, sculpture, furniture design, graphic design, architecture, and soon urban planning support this experiment, carried out simultaneously by different group creators. De Style productions naturally go beyond the traditional and academic division between primary and secondary arts, decorative arts, architecture, and urban planning.\nFrom the realm of the mind to the city, this can be the guiding thread for the evolution of the Style's productions during its fourteen years of life. The spatial nature of the work of art gradually reaches from the status of supporting the analysis of the world to a factor in building the social and political environment of the city. In this way, the spatialization of the work forms an experience of the world, gives order to the world, and gives essence to society. \nThe Style's priority is to invent an official language that responds to the challenges of the industrial society after World War I and outlines strategies for implementing the new social order.\nThe method of this vision is Neo-plasticism, which initially consists in radicalizing the approach of the contemporary avant-gardes.",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.

            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

Today, our most basic human rights are being ignored in Iran, and we fight for them every day. In my land, women fight and die but do not accept humiliation. Women and men stand shoulder to shoulder and fight together.\n\n🟢I published this collection of 1401 generative tokens to show my support for the people of Iran. 401 tokens are reserved for other known supporters of this cause, and 1000 tokens are free to mint.\n\n🟢All my works about Iran's freedom are royalty-free and will always be. Due to fxhash's limitation on royalty selection, I have selected it all for the minter.\n\n✅After completing the token animation, you can save the image in the following sizes and apply the following color filters: \n\n⌨️ SPACE key   ⏩ No Animation\n⌨️ \"r\"   key   🔁 Reset All Filters\n⌨️ \"c\"   key   ▶️  Random Tint Mode\n⌨️ \"g\"   key   ▶️  Grayscale Mode\n⌨️ \"t\"   key   ▶️  Black & White Mode (Normal)\n⌨️ \"y\"   key   ▶️  Black & White Mode (Darker)\n⌨️ \"u\"   key   ▶️  Black & White Mode (Brighter)\n⌨️ \"i\"   key   ▶️  Invert Mode\n⌨️ \"p\"   key   ▶️  Random Posterized Mode\n\n⌨️ Key number  1️⃣  1000✖️1000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  2️⃣  2000✖️2000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  3️⃣  3000✖️3000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  4️⃣  4000✖️4000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  5️⃣  5000✖️5000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  6️⃣  6000✖️6000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  7️⃣  7000✖️7000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  8️⃣  8000✖️8000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  0️⃣  16000✖️16000 pixels\n\n🅿️5️⃣ Built with p5js\n\n🔆Generative art by Arash",
