            "description": "Nebula is one of the most magnificent stellar phenomena to behold. It is a distinct luminescent part of the interstellar medium, which consists of ionized gas and cosmic dust. Nebulae are often star-forming regions, where stars are born in solitude but surrounded by beautiful light and matter.\n\nIn this series, I continue the exploration of color and gravity, the effect of mass on speed, the effect of speed on hue, and how light can change by passing through big particles and dust systems.\n\nI also want to let you participate in the creation of your artwork variation too. Each iteration is a unique and unpredictable dance of light in the dust and gravitation between matter clusters, however,  with the controls listed below, you can change the probability of light/dust blocks as well as the tiling layout.\n\n[L] - create a new layout\n[S] - reshuffle the current layout\n\n[Shift] + [1] - change dust blocks probability to 0.0 and reshuffle the current layout\n[Shift] + [2] - —//— 0.2\n[Shift] + [3] - —//— 0.4\n[Shift] + [4] - —//— 0.6\n[Shift] + [5] - —//— 0.8\n[Shift] + [6] - —//— 1.0\n\nBasics:\n[A] - skip/restart the animation\n\n[1] - save PNG in low resolution\n[2] - save PNG in medium resolution\n[3] - save PNG in high resolution\n[4] - save PNG in ultra-high resolution\n\nExperimental zone:\n[E] - toggle endless animation\n[0] - save the current frame in low resolution\n\nSaving with high and ultra-high resolution may take a while, please be patient.\n\nUse Chrome 107 for the best experience, other browsers are significantly slower on this artwork, visual results also may vary.\n\nMade with love and p5js\n\nBy Collapsar Beauty\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

            "description": "The initial spark for this piece started with Armin Hofmann’s exercises in style and composition. Just as George Nelson wrote in the preface to Armin’s book Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practices: \"Despite all our efforts to simplify things - efforts constantly expanding in order to keep abreast of steadily increasing complexity - nothing is very simple anymore\", these explorations just opened doors to other issues, and further grounded the idea that \"if problems can be correctly stated, they can be solved.\"\n\nArmin suggests we go back to the beginning, to concern ourselves with dots and circles and lines and then bring opposed components in confrontation. \"Confrontation is a theme on which variations can be played with any desired consonances, with any imaginable values, and in a great variety of ways. [...] (Only then) (s)he will be able to find creative solutions to the problems presented by the confrontation of opposites.\"\n\nVery quickly opposed components, even with extending the angle of vision from the two-dimensional surface to the three-dimensional space, and with the contrasts of thin-thick, solid-transparent, softened-hardened line, etc., started looking like I’m weaving complicated plots, visually similar to textile works by  Bauhaus women - Gunta Stölzl, Anni Albers, Gertrud Preiswerk and others.\n\nWhen Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919, he proclaimed that “every eligible person whose talent and training are considered adequate will be accepted without regard to age and sex.” However, in practice, discriminatory gender roles were reinforced, and female students were guided and advised to work with textiles rather than in workshops for heavy crafts such as carpentry. Despite that, Gropius’s “women’s section” became one of its most collaborative and brave experimental sectors. \n\nA hundred years later, it is disappointing to see we still carry on with inherited gender roles. Check the number of female computer science students in your country. How are things going \"at the intersection of arts and technology\"? I've implemented some of the percentages from Serbia in the distribution of shapes in the final compositions. I sampled the number of female vs. male students at the Faculty of Mathematics and the University of Arts (where I studied and now work), and gender distribution among graduated students, and it didn't look bad at all. But then I realized I'm the only female professor (out of 5) teaching main subjects at doctoral studies program in digital arts.\n\n\"When a group is underrepresented, people come to take that underrepresentation as the norm.\" Since representation is imperative to achieving equality, it is equally critical to change the biases we’ve developed over centuries.\n\nFor the title, I chose a dated version of the word for a female weaver on purpose. My native language is one of the Slavic languages, which are all gender sensitive. It is natural to have feminitives, but since historically some occupations were less (or not at all) practiced by women, many of the feminitives for those professions, jobs, and specializations are rarely used or don't exist in the dictionary. Also, not surprisingly, the dominant version of the noun describing a person who weaves in Serbian would be the female noun \"tkalja\", whereas the male version is so rare that is missing from some dictionaries. Conscientiously choosing the female version of the noun for the title, I position myself and this piece in the historical context with Bauhaus weveresses, contemporary language, and gender contexts, and finally in the curatorial context of the exhibition. \n\nCode Weaveresses is part of the FEMGEN exhibition curated by Micol Ap @verticalcrypoto in partnership with @RtClick_Save and @artblocks_io.\n",

Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

The human settlements are growing like huge organisms – and the growth is often impossible to plan, control or limit.\nCities as a phenomenon are with their incredible complexity highly enigmatic structures, that are as fascinating as they are terrifying.\n\nThis project is a study of the beauty of complexity.\n\nEach city iteration is an entirely unique structure with unique hatching, arrangement of buildings, heights, sizes, additions and rare items.\nThe cities are made even more organic by the meticulous modelling of analog ink drawing.\n\nThe project is 100% generative. All lines, hatching and dots are generated for each iteration.\n\nAs a gesture of appreciation towards our supporters, 20% of royalties will go to the original minter.\n\nKey commands:\nPress 's' to save a png version\nPress '2' to render at twice the resolution\nPress 'b' to remove the colored background before saving\n\nThe loading progress is animated, hence the epileptic trigger warning.\nDue to memory constraints on mobile devices, rendering uses a lower resolution on these.\n-----------\n\nOriginal concept by @Lax_raven\nAll code by @r1b2art",

            "description": "Roll the dice with shapes and capture the moment!\nAlea, by the way, is Latin and means dice / gambling.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach Alea consists of 64 objects randomly arranged around a center and randomly differing in shape, texture, and movement. A curated 5 colors palette is picked and used for the textures. The colors are first sorted by saturation to select a reference color. With this, the colors are then sorted again by luminance.\n\nThe animation itself is 32 frames long and stops abruptly. It consists of 3 layers. The first layer moves the objects around the center and draws the animated objects. The second uses the first layer and a double buffer to capture the motion blur based on a depth mask. The third is mainly for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- shapes [7] (toruses, cubes, planes, toruses & cubes, toruses & planes, cubes & planes, toruses, cubes & planes)\n- palette [58] (based on German Max Magazine covers 1991 - 1995)\n- color sort direction [2] (up, down) - sort by saturation\n- color sort reference [3] (0, 1, 2) - used for sorting by luminance / background color\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 32 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar to trigger a spinning animation (or single click / tap)\n- `o` to trigger random object change animation followed by a rotation animation (or double click / tap)\n- `r` to trigger a random feature change followed by a random object change and rotation animation (or triple click / tap)\n- `k` to toggle this kiosk mode (off, 3, 5 or 10 secs)\n- `c` to capture an image\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- size=8000 - sets the base size for width/height to 8000px (default 3000, useful if you want to capture bigger pngs)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=5 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

            "description": "Roll the dice with shapes and capture the moment!\nAlea, by the way, is Latin and means dice / gambling.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach Alea consists of 64 objects randomly arranged around a center and randomly differing in shape, texture, and movement. A curated 5 colors palette is picked and used for the textures. The colors are first sorted by saturation to select a reference color. With this, the colors are then sorted again by luminance.\n\nThe animation itself is 32 frames long and stops abruptly. It consists of 3 layers. The first layer moves the objects around the center and draws the animated objects. The second uses the first layer and a double buffer to capture the motion blur based on a depth mask. The third is mainly for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- shapes [7] (toruses, cubes, planes, toruses & cubes, toruses & planes, cubes & planes, toruses, cubes & planes)\n- palette [58] (based on German Max Magazine covers 1991 - 1995)\n- color sort direction [2] (up, down) - sort by saturation\n- color sort reference [3] (0, 1, 2) - used for sorting by luminance / background color\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 32 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar to trigger a spinning animation (or single click / tap)\n- `o` to trigger random object change animation followed by a rotation animation (or double click / tap)\n- `r` to trigger a random feature change followed by a random object change and rotation animation (or triple click / tap)\n- `k` to toggle this kiosk mode (off, 3, 5 or 10 secs)\n- `c` to capture an image\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- size=8000 - sets the base size for width/height to 8000px (default 3000, useful if you want to capture bigger pngs)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=5 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

It doesn't matter, you did it right. Your accomplishments will serve well the next generations in their journeys, in their search for themselves.\n\nNow it's time to stop, time to take a moment and contemplate the vast universe.\n\nSoon all of this will be ending.\n\nYou did it right.\n\nEmbrace the void.\n=========\n=========\n\n\n./ Color scheme (feature)\nThere are 12 color schemes and with each set, specific arrays for color collections for the space, stars, planet, and accent colors. \n\nThese are color schemes in the known universe of \"In the Edge\":\n- Mars visions\n- Cyberpunk\n- Unknown passenger \n- Renegade\n- Primary\n- Coral\n- r.e.d.\n- Machines of an ancient-future \n- The void\n- Tinted light \n- Malibu dreams\n- Atari (horrendous brown, red and yellowish combinations... I love it)\n\n./ Mountain type (feature)\nIn the Edge, you will find a mountain, and that mountain will be special, which type will you find?\n\n- Parallela insolitum\n- Sandy dunes of the truth\n- Wavy uncertainty\n- Intrinsic soul ridges\n- Cerritulus formationis\n\n./ Mountain direction (feature)\nLife is about direction... mountains too.\n\n- Left\n- Right\n- Left-Right\n\n./ Space scenery\nThis is the spicy touch, some of the iterations will have animation and others will not, giving you a clear view of the magnificent space in front of you.\n\n- Clean (NOT animated)\n- Windy planet (animated)\n- Topographic planet (animated)\n- Meteor shower (animated)\n\n./ Distance from Earth (feature)\nHow far did you go?
