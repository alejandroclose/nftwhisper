It plays on my own fascination with scale models and bird's-eye views, as well as technical drawings.\n\nThe number of parameters that can be tweaked was purposefully kept to a minimum. Even the best planners cannot (and maybe should not try to) account for everything.\n\nDuring the late stages of the creative process, I read Jane Jacobs's 1958 essay 'Downtown is for People' and it played an important role in how I decided to frame this work. The last words, especially, stuck with me: 'Designing a dream city is easy; rebuilding a living one takes imagination.'\n\n—\n\nWhat You See Is What You Get: the minter’s wallet and seed parameter are used to seed the algorithm. Your mint will look exactly as it appears in the preview.\n\n—\n\nControls\nS - PNG export\nV - animated SVG export\nG - GIF export\nP - plottable SVG export\nF - fullscreen\nC - hide/show cursor\nSPACE/click - pause/unpause animations\n\n—\n\nCreated by loackme, 2023\n",

This project, initiated this spring, allowed me to delve into various mechanics and approaches. Today, I am concluding this inaugural study on the cube and publishing it on fxhash, with the aim of sharing it and enabling others to play around with the parameters that make it up.\n\nThanking each individual who has contributed to this project, whether intentionally or otherwise, would be a lengthy task, and I risk forgetting someone. Therefore, a huge thanks goes out to the community here and on OpenProcessing for their ongoing exchange of advice and knowledge.\n\nWhile the code remains riddled with errors, I won't be progressing further with this initial project. This will presumably allow me to avoid overworking on subsequent projects. :-)\n\nmade with p5js, p5.grain and chroma.js\non Openprocessing https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1962145\n",

This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

The role of lines is such that sometimes they help the dynamics of the composition and sometimes they appear in the form of texture and its contrast with empty spaces leads to the visual richness of the work. I avoided drawing various visual elements in favor of clarity of composition. Also, in order to avoid exaggeration, I used colors sparingly because I think they will have a stronger impact in their occasional presence.\n\nCreated using p5.js.",

The less practical and most bizarre, basically the most overcomplicated self-made tool anyone could ever imagine. But it's THE tool to explore ideas.\nI created this one to investigate, to poke and nudge at a few concepts that seem to go hand-in-hand.\nFirstly, Representation, as in changing something to better explain it. Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.\n\nWhile many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.\n\nBut there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.\n\nI can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.\n\nWhat happens when a flower has more petals than pixels? Why do we know there's more layers to that thumbnail?\nMy best answer is:\n\n--Press \"s\" key to save a bigger image (2400x3200 px)\n",

            "description": "'Murals' is a collection of 256 abstract compositions born out of an intense period diving deeply into street art, pointillism and the inner workings of neural networks.\n\nThe work explores projection, refraction and abstraction of points as they ripple through multi-dimensional space-time. Points refract through multi-dimensional space to become shapes, which then become coordinate systems for the projections of new points that create a sense of form, texture, lighting, and material properties. \n\nThe work is also a celebration of imperfections and how a combination of many tiny – almost individually imperceptibly small – imperfect details can shape our perceptions of form, materiality, mood. This is explored within this work through subtle uses of sprays, flecks, scuffs, cuts, grain, targets (projections of projections), construction lines, base projections, occasional glitches that cause curvature, bounced light, shadows, and more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n15 colour palettes: \nScream, Night Bus, Double Backflip, Jaws, Sunday, Atom, Space, Tipex, \nGraphite, Leaf, Earth, Bubble Gum, Citrus, Jellyfish, Damp Concrete.\n\n4 times of day (that create subtle changes in light colour):\nDaylight, Winter Morning, Midnight, Sunset\n\n2 Border types: \nNormal, Thin\n\nVarious features that subtly impact appearance surface textures and shard forms:\nMetallic, Engrave, Number of Shards, Scuff Marks, Symmetry. \n\nControls:\n- Press [ S ] to save the work at its current image size as a PNG.\n- Press [ 1 ] to set the image size to 1440 x 1944 pixels (default size)\n- Press [ 2 ] to set the image size to 2880 x 3888 pixels\n- Press [ 3 ] to set the image size to 4320 x 5832 pixels\n\n- Press [ F ] to toggle freeform mode to create custom image sizes and aspect ratios\n- Press [ R ] to reload the image (for use in freeform mode)\n\nThis work has been tested on Chrome and Safari on Mac OS, and also using an Android smartphone. Please make sure that it works on your device before minting. Based on testing (in May 2022), each work should take about 5-10 seconds to fully load on a laptop or desktop machine, and 15-20 seconds on a mobile device.

            "description": "aRo \"a Representation of\"\n\nLike a ladder or a hammer, art is often a tool. The less practical and most bizarre, basically the most overcomplicated self-made tool anyone could ever imagine. But it's THE tool to explore ideas.\nI created this one to investigate, to poke and nudge at a few concepts that seem to go hand-in-hand.\nFirstly, Representation, as in changing something to better explain it. Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.\n\nWhile many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.\n\nBut there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.\n\nI can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.\n\nWhat happens when a flower has more petals than pixels? Why do we know there's more layers to that thumbnail?\nMy best answer is:\n\n--Press \"s\" key to save a bigger image (2400x3200 px)\n",
