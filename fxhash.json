It involves arranging, manipulating and combining circles to form different shapes, patterns and designs.\nHere, concepts such as symmetry, balance, rhythm and repetition are often examined. I used circles of different sizes, colors, textures, and opacity to create depth and visual interest, and added compositions like squiggly lines for complexity and variety.\nThe possibilities are endless when it comes to circles, as they have the freedom to experiment with different techniques and styles. It can take many forms including minimal, abstract designs, mandalas (spiritual symbols), optical illusions or even representational images made entirely of circles.\nBy focusing on the simplicity and versatility of circles, I have created a visual approach that evokes harmony, unity, and balance while also allowing for creative expression.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "Diamond Twirl Composition was inspired by a series of OP Art paintings done by Victor Vasarely, called Collage Vert (c. 1990). Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the second in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nDiamond Twirl Composition is a regular grid of square tiles. The background of each square tile is filled with a random color. A coin-toss algorithm then decides whether to draw a diamond shaped polygon in its own random color leaning left or leaning right connected to opposite corner of the square tile background. Every iteration is unique and filled with energy. \n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "The first version of Bulges & Dents was produced in 1975 at Michigan State University. In the medium of the day it was a Plotter Drawing written in FORTRAN and executed on a mainframe. The original work can be seen at:\n\nhttps://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/102533321289937785770383303242324483383336827215255965779615131544848265379841\n\nIt was the early days of computer graphics/ computer art and I was still acquiring programming skills. I was fortunate to have my friend and collaborator Christopher Scussel help me write the algorithm.\n\nI met Herbert W. Franke in 1977 and we became friends. I asked him to submit some of his work to a show I guest-curated at the Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art in 1980, which he did. Later he honored me by a mention and thumbnail of Bulges & Dents 1975 in his book: Computer Art - Computer Graphics, Second, Revised and Enlarged Edition (Springer-Verlag) 1985, p118.\n\nBulges & Dents 2022 is an encore collaboration between Chris and me. A redux and re-imagination of a concept we worked on 47 years later. What a thrill to be working with Chris again. I believe we took it to the next level. \n\nOur picture plane is truly a plastic space that consists of a tessellation of tiles with a white central dot and a gradient background. Chris has transformed the bulges and dents into spatial forces that push and pull at that space. The number of bulges and dents, their locations and their sizes are controlled by random variables. Also, for purely aesthetic reasons, it's a coin toss as to whether the white bounding boxes of the tiles are drawn by the program or not. Bulges and dents often collide in the picture space forming complex interactions that tear at the space frame and often distort its edges. The random intersections of push and pull forces produce a very visually dynamic image. \n\nBecause of the interesting connection of this work to Herbert w. Franke I submit this work as a precursor to his Tribute: https://www.tribute-hwf.com/\n\nPlease visit http://www.drbillkolomyjec.com",

How could he have predicted that this would become a basic building block of almost all Generative Art, especially NFT's on fxhash. His work (Logic Grid Construction #2) was in a show called Art In/Art Out  I curated at The Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art in 1980. (Reference: https://www.drbillkolomyjec.com/events-and-media/art-in-art-out) \n\nI was inspired by Roger's work at the beginning of my career. In this piece I have taken the liberty of analyzing his \"tile\" structures and synthesizing them into my own composition using my Boxes algorithm.

An algorithmic version of Action Painting.\n\nMy Fractions of the Whole algorithm organizes the space frame into areas for a tile comprised of closed paths of bezier line segments with random parameters. An underlying layer is tessellated with tiles made up of closed pathways are filled with a random color; that simulates the chance effects of dripping and spilling paint onto a canvas. Simulating the moving brush-in-hand, nine more iterations the image are overdrawn, each in separate random color, where the shapes are in outline (not filled). The result is a highly dynamic image that simulates the direct, instinctual, and spontaneous application of vigorous, sweeping lines of color.  \n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Boxes I and II combine two of my original plotter art pieces from the 1970s. In the beginning when we only had the most primitive of output devices: main frames, FORTRAN and line plotters. A small community of computer artists began producing aesthetic works and they were an inspiration to all of us. I was influenced by one of these earliest pioneers: George Nees. His work called \"Gravel\" inspired me to create Boxes I and, it's complement, Boxes II.\n\nThe overall structure is a regular grid of square tiles. As the computer draws each square its position relative to the center of the array is calculated. In the case of Boxes I the closer each individual square is to the center of the grid, the more random displacement (rotation and translation) is allowed by the algorithm; loose on the inside. In the case of Boxes II the further each square is relative to the center of the grid the more displacement is allowed; loose on the outside. \n\n(c)2022 Dr. Bill Kolomyjec. All rights reserved.

However, while there may be a grid of 5 x 5 squares in the composition there is a grid of 9 x 9 circles superimposed over the squares. \n\nFirst a random color is chosen for the overall background. Each square is drawn in its place in a random color and that color value is saved. On a second pass the circles are drawn, if they fall in the middle of a square they are rendered in that squares' complementary color. If the circle falls between the squares it is rendered in the background color appearing to alter the shape of the underlying square.\n\nAgain, there are many Gestalt interactions within this piece. The most prominent being the figure-ground relationship. The in-between background colored squares form a strong unifying structure, as do the other similar shapes. In Gestalt, similar shapes are seen together as a unifying whole.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Superimposed Rectangles\n\nThis is the fifth in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nSuperimposed Rectangles is my variation of one of Knowlton’s test examples: Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids (Example 3). As Christopher Scussel continues to revamp the EXPLOR engine I endeavor to understand its capabilities as an aesthetic tool.\n\nThe inherent qualities of an original EXPLOR image is it is low resolution and uses a 4 gray scale color palette. When it was used in the 1970’s images were often generated this way as a series of frames then recorded on film and manipulated in post production. In this image we use a higher resolution (250x250) and employ 3x3 “blocks” of pixels instead of alphanumeric character combinations that we can render in 24bit color. \n\nTHE EXPLOR language consists of a set of functions that manipulate the contents of an internal array. Each element in internal display memory maps into a block in the output image. The CHANJ() function places rectangular areas of blocks over previously drawn sections in internal memory and more important, it applies rules that look at the current state of a particular array element and applies a rule to change that element. The trick is how to make this visually interesting.\n\nI employ a grid structure to distribute a rectangular widget across the picture plane. The widget is a randomly defined area that grows in a random direction based on a set of random variables. During each iteration the new area overwrites internal memory (following a set  of rules). I think this variation looks and feels like Knowlton’s Example 3 and maintains the EXPLOR vibe. The rectangles interact to form dimensional depth and an architectural quality.\n\nWe continue to honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT series. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored now updated by Scussel and Kolomyjec. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history with a modern twist.\n\n(c)2022 Dr. Bill Kolomyjec and Christoper Scussel. All rights reserved.",

            "description": "In 1980, I had the pleasure of inviting Vera Molnár to participate in an exhibition I curated at the Ukrainian Institute of Modern Art in Chicago. She was a pioneer of digital art, and her work was already well-known in Europe, but she was still relatively unknown in the United States. I was eager to introduce her work to a wider audience, and I was not disappointed.\n\nVera's work is characterized by its simplicity, elegance, and mathematical rigor. She uses basic geometric shapes and patterns to create complex and mesmerizing images. Her work is often described as \"visual music,\" and it is easy to see why. Her images have a rhythmic quality that is both soothing and stimulating.\n\nI am delighted to see that Vera is finally getting the recognition she deserves. She is a true pioneer of digital art, and her work has had a profound impact on the field. I am honored to have been able to play a small role in introducing her work to the world.\n\nThis homage is a small token of my appreciation for Vera's work. It is my hope that it will help to introduce her work to a new generation of viewers.\n\nCongratulations, Vera, on your 99th birthday!\n\nThank you for your contributions to the field of digital art.\n\nYour work is an inspiration to us all.\n\nPlease visit Dr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "The concept of Ambiguity of Limits is based on Zeno's Paradox, which states that you can never reach your destination if you keep halving the distance between you and your destination. In this image, a single tile is placed in the center of a picture frame. Around the perimeter of the tile, an algorithm is used to draw a contiguous ring of half-size versions of the tile. This process is repeated eight times, until the tile size is smaller than a pixel. If the algorithm were to run indefinitely, it would never reach the outer edge of the picture frame. This is because the distance between the tile and the edge of the picture frame is constantly being halved, and as the tile size approaches zero, the distance between the tile and the edge of the picture frame approaches infinity.\n\nThe central tile in the image consists of an algorithmic stroke. This stroke is similar to a hand-drawn pen stroke in a calligraphic exercise. It is created by joining two randomly chosen adjacent corners of the tile with a crescent-shaped area formed by two Bézier curves.\n\nThe Ambiguity of Limits is a fascinating concept that demonstrates the power of mathematics. It shows that even though something may seem impossible, it can still be possible if we use the right tools. In this case, the right tool is mathematics.\n\nPlease visit www.drbillkolomyjec.com",
