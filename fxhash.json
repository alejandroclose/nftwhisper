Colored stripes move with seemingly random energy, yet they come together to form a pixelated tapestry that is both chaotic and ordered, a testament to the beauty of unpredictability.\n\nThis collection is a heartfelt tribute to the loyal NFT collectors who have been unwavering supporters of my creative journey. Each piece in this collection is a token of gratitude for the community that has stood by me from the beginning.\n\nIt was born out of the launch of my inaugural NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain via Foundation. \n\n\"The beauty of reflection\" NFT release on Foundation: https://foundation.app/collection/presale\n\nCreated by VICIV, 2023.09\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n\nPress \"s\" to save a high resoution png image",

It is characterized by simplicity and minimalism, and I focused on using clean and precise lines to convey shapes, forms, and textures. Also emphasized outlines, color palettes, and subject lines rather than shadows to create a more substantial visual impact.\nI expressed this idea through lines with simplicity and clarity to leave room for interpretation by the viewer. One of the advantages of line art is its versatility. I combined lines with geometric shapes to add depth and texture to the image. \nOverall, I tried to offer a unique way of expressing creativity by focusing on clean lines and minimal aesthetics, and I believe that lines can have an eternal charm that will continue to captivate audiences in various artistic media such as digital art.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "Organic Illusion is one of the very first computer graphic drawings I produced that I considered worthy of being called Art. This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory. Like a child you never forget. I submit to you again in new media for you all to enjoy.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "\"Junina\" is a tribute to the June popular festivities in Brazil, when the streets and house facades are decorated on many cities, mainly on the Northeast Region of the country. Small flags, paper balloons, and lamps are hung on public space creating a very special atmosphere and colorful landscapes. \n\nPlenty of forró (traditional music), bonfires, fireworks, typical food and drinks are part of these festivities that celebrate rural popular culture. The “Festas Juninas” (June festivities) have an important affective place in the imaginary of the Brazilian population. \n\n\"Junina\" continues the experimentations with code of my previous work \"Monotipia\". The challenge of creating graphic compositions with simple elements remains. Searching and trying to delve deeper into ways to play with the rhythm and subtleties of transparencies, colors, shapes and textures.\n\nThis project is also an homage to the painters who made the Brazilian June festivities as the theme of their works, especially Alfredo Volpi (1896-1988) and Alberto da Veiga Guignard (1896-1962), but also Anita Malfatti (1889-1964), Emiliano Di Cavalcanti (1897-1976), Heitor dos Prazeres (1898-1966), and many others.\n\n---\nFeatures:\n-> 8 palettes (rarest = grayscale)\n-> 9 compositions\n-> Elements: 6 geometric shapes OR mixed element compositions\n-> 5 canvas formats: \n-----> tall portrait (9:16)\n-----> portrait (2:3)\n-----> square (1:1)\n-----> landscape (3:2)\n-----> wide landscape (16:9) = rarest\n-> Border colors: \n-----> soft\n-----> dark\n-----> deep gray\n-----> soberest color from palette\n-----> random color from palette (rarest)\n\n* The names of the color palettes are words related to popular June festivals. The decision to use untranslated expressions was made because these words carry many poetic meanings in Portuguese. For example, \"cinza\" means \"gray\" but also \"ash\". A word that refers to both the color and to the residue that results from burning wood in bonfires.\n\n---\nTo save the image as a png file, type:\n[1] save at actual size \n[2] save with 2000px height\n[3] save with 3000px height\n[4] save with 4000px height\n[5] save with 5000px height\n\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n---\nCreated with p5.js\n\n---\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2023\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada",

            "description": "Boxes I and II combine two of my original plotter art pieces from the 1970s. In the beginning when we only had the most primitive of output devices: main frames, FORTRAN and line plotters. A small community of computer artists began producing aesthetic works and they were an inspiration to all of us. I was influenced by one of these earliest pioneers: George Nees. His work called \"Gravel\" inspired me to create Boxes I and, it's complement, Boxes II.\n\nThe overall structure is a regular grid of square tiles. As the computer draws each square its position relative to the center of the array is calculated. In the case of Boxes I the closer each individual square is to the center of the grid, the more random displacement (rotation and translation) is allowed by the algorithm; loose on the inside. In the case of Boxes II the further each square is relative to the center of the grid the more displacement is allowed; loose on the outside. \n\n(c)2022 Dr. Bill Kolomyjec. All rights reserved.
