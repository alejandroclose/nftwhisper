Lines are drawn at a time given by a configuration. Once a point line has hit an attractor it both the line drawing and attractor are removed.",

            "description": "About the previous work (YANF) and during the development of this new one some people told me that it looks like carved in wood or metal or made of silk or felt, that they would like to touch it. From these considerations I decided to call this new work 'Materia'.\n\nThis new abstract work follows the lines of the previous work (YANF) going further in the direction of conveying a material sensation.\n\nHere in contrast to YANF the main field-generating functions are semi-random combinations of transcendental, polynomial and irrational functions instead of noise.\n\nThe field generated by the randomly chosen function is perturbed with different kinds of noise at different scales to obtain variety and more natural look at the same time.\n\nThe gradient orientation of the field is used to modulate luminosity to give the impression of lights and shadows even if all is drawn with bi-dimensional object (no 3D).\n\nThe final step of adding flow lines along the contour, together with previous step for lights and shadows, leads us to the final result which gives us the feeling of a material object that could be touched.\n\nFunction names were generated by ChatGPT after reading this description, I don't know why all those divine, celestial, mystic, ...\n\nThe palettes used are a subset of the Studio Yorktown Color Town Hall MIT licensed palettes with two exceptions ('ABBA' and 'BAAB').\n\n\nDefault resolution: 2000x2000\n\n[2] to redraw at double resolution (4000x4000 - it takes four times then default)\n[1] to redraw at default resolution\n[s] to save a png at current resolution\n\nSources of variations are:\n- 36 palettes\n- 32 field generating functions\n- 2 phase parameters each with 8 possible values\n- 2 types of noise\n- 2 values for scale (high, low)\n- added noise at fine scale (True, False)\n- colors banding (True, False)\n\n\nDeveloped with p5.js, FastNoiseLite.js and chroma.js libraries.\n\nCreated by Andrea Belloni, fxhash: anbello, twitter: @Waterflowing0.

In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
