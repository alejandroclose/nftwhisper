            "description": "Lines, our simple geometric friends, are nice and neat ideal forms. Until they’re not. Here they shake, crumble, twist and bend. Just like everything else in our fragile world. We put a lot of faith in lines, from marking out political borders to defining our designs, but maybe they aren’t as reliable as they seem.\n\nIn this work we make small, probing journeys into the space between pure shiny mathematics and the brittle chaos of materiality that this math tries to define. Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.\n\nI like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!\n\nMade with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.\n\nThere’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter. Sometimes unnoticed, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with angst. But always with a kind of truth. And I hope this work can conjure a kind of hazy evocation of all this. The message is only meant to be a feeling, at most.\n\n## Generate a printable version\n\nTo generate a version for printing, add the search parameter `?print=true` to the url. This disables the initial animation and doens't trigger a canvas resize when the window changes size.\n\nYou can then also add your preferred width of canvas by adding a `width` parameter, eg: `?print=true&width=2000`. Depending on your browser there's a limit to the maximum width you can use. Using Chrome on an Apple M1 laptop, I can go up to a width of 4700px, but experiment with what works for you.\n\nOnce the image is ready, press [s] on your keyboard to save as a PNG.\n\nTested in all major browsers on Apple silicon and on windows PC with an Intel chip.",

We as humans have a need to leave traces - stories - that others can read and learn from. What will be the traces machines want to leave? This piece employs sinusoidal signals drawn with lines as a simple metaphor for every trace and every language, for every message and every communication.\n\necologías-A is an entity that is part of a broader ecology. Released on occasion of the show \"Unbound - Ecology in the Age of Machines\" at Unit London. The data generated by this entity is read by a different piece minted on Ethereum, creating a link between Tezos and Ethereum, a metaphor for an ecology of blockchains.\n\nit shares a common element with two other works released on fxhash: ecologías B and ecologías C, all of them contributing data to aforementioned pieces.\n\nread more at https://www.iillucid.com/ecologias\n\n15% of primary sales are donated to institutions working towards improving biodiversity and environmental efforts.\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nBuilt on p5.js, glsl\n\nappend &pd=N (N a number) to the URL in live view to increase/decrease resolution\npress s to save current image in current resolution\npress z,x,g,b,n followed by +/- to increase/decrease, respectively, brightness, contrast, gamma, blur, noise",

It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

The tip of the triangle is the uterus which makes the space grow.\n-- LIA DREI (Diaries, 2004)\n\nMy paintings have no past, they are empty of meaning in the present, but await the discussions of the future, as remotely as possible.\nAnd this is why they don't have their feet firmly planted in the ground, although there are invisible roots that take life from the earth, like so many blades of grass.\nWhile I work I look for the truth in what I do. The time is not yesterday because it would be false, it is not today because the emotion takes my breath away and I die every moment and am reborn after every new brushstroke.\nSoon after, time becomes old, useless, meaningless. I never know what will come out with the next brushstroke or spatula stroke.\nMy thoughts go at supersonic speed and only stop to choose another color. The one just painted is never the right one. So I live the life of the new painting with the sense of mystery that the moonless night has. (…)\n-- LIA DREI (Notes, 1962)\n\n----\n\nI never talk about myself.\n\nI'm not creative.\nI blatantly steal other people's art.\nI'm a bad coder, I copy, paste, mix ideas.\nI often ruin it, degrade it.\nBut I always make it mine what I like.\n\nI absorb.\n\n-- ALESSANDRO FIORE (fxhash, 2024)\n\n\n—————\n\nThe work is created responsive by default and it will adapt to the browser window.

            "description": "The second piece in this series is dedicated to another fundamental algorithm in computer graphics: Voronoi. It's origin precedes its use with computers by several decades, or centuries, depending on who to credit, since science always is a continuum. In the generative art & design field, the algorithm has been an instrumental tool for generation(s) of practioners, sadly often to the point of turning cliché.\n\nIn this piece I've attempted to \"break\" the classic resulting aesthetics of this algorithm and focus more on revealing its inner workings. There are many ways of computing a Voronoi diagram. The so called Jump Flood Algorithm (JFA) proved to be the visually most interesting approach to me. Again, as with the previous De/Frag piece, here the algorithm has been slowed down, timesliced and customized in dozens of ways to result in a more painterly character overall and produce a variety of new shapes & textures.\n\nFullscreen compatible (Press 'S' to toggle square frame).
