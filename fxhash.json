But why do so much awful things still exist? Well, there are many possiblities:\n - The problem is profitable for those who are working on the solution, thus in reality they would never want to solve it\n - The problem doesn't exist, it's either made up or misinterpreted\n - Fixing the problem would inflict more harm than good\n - The solution wasn't found yet\n - The solution isn't what was expected, thus it's being denied",

Each maze's solution and color-palette are unuique; Both are created on-the-fly by the generator.\n\n\n** There are billions of possible mazes to be generated! **\n\n\nMazes also have distinct physics in gameplay mode.\n\n... oh yeah, did I mention that these mazes are PLAYABLE??\n\nAfter the genesis animation completes, on PC, press 'g' to play, or 'h' to reveal the solution.\nOn mobile, touch below or left of the maze to play, above or right for the solution.\n\nIn game mode:\nOn PC, use [W,A,S,D] to move. To return to the maze overview, hold 'q' for 3 seconds.\nOn mobile, touch the maze to move. Remain still for 30 seconds to quit.\n\n\nBecause these mazes are sometimes difficult to solve, each one is equipped with visual \"hints\"\nto help you along your way. Some maze's hints are easy to see and pop up frequently,\nothers are difficult to see and rarely appear.\nKeep an eye out for them!\n\n\n----------\n\nFeatures:\n\n4 levels of grid 'tidiness' (clean, lived-in, untidy, squiggly)\n5 maze sizes (small, medium large, macro, full)\n5 levels of roominess (Claustrophobic, Tight, Small, Roomy, Spacious)\n\n2 generator algorithms:\n- Growing Tree \n- Blobby Recursive Likeness-following Subdivider\n\n5 Color-sample radii (used to colorize grid-vertices)\n5 color-affinities (oblivious, indifferent, observant, interested, obsessed)\n\n35 base images (listed below)\n136 position/size/rotation combinations are possible for each image.\n\n\nGame-mode Features:\n\n1800+ combinations of hint-types (7 styles, 6 rates, 3 durations, 3 envelopes, 5 likelihoods)\n3 levels of player traction\n4 player acceleration-rates\n\n----------\n\nBase images:\nNecromancer (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nFae (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nSolar Squid (Macro photo: 3D sculpture [Acrylic in gel])\nBolt (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nDhalgren 1 (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nBig Bang 1 (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nWar of the Worlds (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nEats Everything (Acrylic on 8x10 canvas)\nGiving Tree (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nBig Bang 2 (Acrylic on 6x6 tile)\nDhalgren 2 (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nLola (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nTrips (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nDark Tower (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nPrimordial (Acrylic on 8x8 board)\nGods and Men (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nWiccan Moon (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nPuppeteer (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nDhalgren 3 (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nBreakfast with Lupa (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nJupiter 3 (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nWizardry (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nTessaract 2 (Acrylic on 12x12 canvas)\nCow (Acrylic on 10x10 board)\nShogun (Acrylic on 12x12 canvas)\nThree Kings (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nAlice (Acrylic on 8x8 board)\nAether (Acrylic on 4x4 tile)\nReaver 1 (Macro photo 3D sculpture [acrylic in gel])\nSelf Portrait (Section 1) (Acrylic on 14x20 canvas)\nSelf Portrait (Section 2) (Acrylic on 14x20 canvas)\n10000 Leagues (Macro photo: 3D sculpture [Acrylic, seashell in gel])\nScarlett's Lair (Acrylic on 8x8 board)\nReaver 2 (Macro photo: 3D sculpture [Acrylic in gel])\nMaze Cat 3 (Photograph: Maze Cat)\n\nImages are also available on the permaweb:\nhttps://app.ardrive.io/#/drives/09e0146d-37cc-450e-8b12-d20f8845b41e/folders/5d16d9ff-5a68-4a6a-b35a-20cc406fb595\n\nThanks again to Jamis Buck for the inspiration and information.

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

            "description": "https://www.bfos.art/projects/adherence\n\n======~~~~~~~~~~===================\nWe aren’t all moving in the same direction.  Sometimes we strictly follow the paths we are destined for.  Sometimes we meander in our own way and on our own time.  Let’s explore the ways that these different paths can create beauty.\n=================~~~~~~~===========\n\n\n============Adherence?=============\nThe title feature of Adherence controls how obediently each of the streamers follow their curated path and whether they die off when destined. While each mint will have a default level of adherence, everyone will be able to see what their piece would look like at all other levels of obedience.\n\nYou might prefer to live life conservatively doing everything that is expected of you…but then you’ll be surprised at what joy and beauty can come from a rebellious spirit.\n\n\n============No Restraint============\nThis project is definitely not a lesson in artistic restraint. It has been very exciting for me to grow this project along with my learnings. I’ve spent 6 months building, adding, cutting, and tweaking.  All of this wrestling has left an embarrassingly mangled code base.  That said, I truly believe the diversity of the output-space is worth it.  \n\nDuring development, I encountered some very severe roadblocks, some of which I felt I might never be able to resolve. One in particular, related to ensuring this project is dimensionless, actually brought me to tears once I finally worked through it. Similarly, there were a fair number of major leaps that took just a few minutes from concept to implementation. \n\nMy objective for my next project will be to bring more restraint…for the sake of my sanity if nothing else. It might take me just as long to complete and I expect that it will be a far smaller release, but I’ll still put just as much care into making sure I deliver a quality project for anyone willing to mint.\n\n\n============Open and Ugly============\nI won’t be obscuring my code.  Anyone is free to use browser dev tools to look and learn to their heart’s content.\n\nBe ye forewarned, though.  It’s not pretty.  I started out well enough, but little tweaks here and there to play and expand on the project has resulted in a code base I might be a little embarrassed about.\n\nBut, that’s OK!  We are all in this together and maybe this will be a way of helping others not feel intimidated by a sense of perfection.  I have also included fairly verbose comments, too, as added commentary to my insanity.\n\nI hope that my openness and vulnerability will be seen by everyone in the community as an invitation to connect with me for any reason.  If you'd like to ask me any questions about this project, about my collecting, about learning to code, about working through challenges, or whatever else...please don't hesitate to ping me in just about any of the fx(hash) related discords (Kaloh's, TENDER, fx(hash), clewcrew) or on twitter.  \n\n\n============Interactions============\n{F}eatures\n{P}rogress\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{N}oise Switch\n{1-3} Adjust Adherence\n{4-9} Save at x² resolution\n{I}nfinite Animation Modes - [Experimental] \n\nThere are two infinite animation modes.  I call them experimental because they didn't quite reach the level of polish that I would have preferred.  \n\nThe first mode is a loop-with-reverse.  It runs efficiently, but I think it's a little too obvious what it is doing.  It also messes with the background color.\n\nThe second mode is a more subtle loop that I actually love, but performance is VERY dependent on your device.  My M1 Mac runs it fairly well, but most other devices struggle through frames.  Even at a lower framerate, I think it's a neat effect.  Though, I wish I was able to figure out a way to improve the performance.  I tried a lot of tricks, but none helped that much.\n\n======~~~~~~~~~~==============================~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~==============================\n\n",

Outputs are made up of arrangements of squares in various compositions, yet within that we are free to imagine what they could mean. For some, the resulting shapes might represent DNA strands or atoms. Others might see cells or the building blocks of the hereditary instructions that shape us as individuals. \n\nA generative genetic report accompanies each output to spark the imagination and attempt to attach further meaning to each composition. Some gene sequences carry mutations, however not all mutations are visually apparent.

            "description": "ASCII-SCAPE\n\nLike for many others growing up during the 1980s & 90s, my very first hands-on encounter with actual computer graphics (outside of games) was in the form of \"textmode\" and its various alphanumeric characters and other symbols available on the 8bit home computers of that period. These machines were perfectly capable of producing fairly high-resolution & multi-color graphics (all relative), yet most systems booted into an interactive prompt with the so-called textmode as de-facto standard environment, providing a level, if also limited, playing field for the creation of text-based graphics from a patchwork of characters & symbols of a predefined font (system or custom). As is so often the case, limitation is the mother of invention and the regular, monospaced grid and standardized set of characters quickly encouraged an entire subculture of specialized designers & artists to emerge (which is currently being re-discovered & remixed by younger generations), applying & showcasing their creativity (with often surprisingly ingenious skills) in the form of game designs, user interfaces, disk mags, demoscene productions, competitions, flyers, BBSes and even various early Web designs of the mid/late 90s.\n\nASCII-SCAPE is an attempted non-nostalgic homage to these roots & culture. It is also a textmode-only (no canvas!) rework of my previous piece C-SCAPE. It combines my love of cellular automata with the stripped back aesthetics & limitations of using only text as representation medium of these co-evolving generative systems. It required an almost complete rewrite & re-curation of various elements: 1200+ new handpicked rule combinations, 32 character sets, 40 color themes, new relationships & biases to better manage the resulting textures, densities and contrast.\n\nAlthough technically not strictly \"ASCII\" (an actual standard, but also a popular shorthand for \"text only\"), the entire simulation only uses various Unicode characters and the beautiful Iosevka open source typeface by Renzhi Li aka Belleve Invis.\n\nLike its parent C-SCAPE, this project is dynamic and evolves indefinitely. It's best viewed on non-mobile devices, where there's a decent horizontal resolution to provide sufficient simulation space. Please see the C-SCAPE project description for further details. There's no graphical export feature, but output can be captured into an UTF-8 plain text file (max. 100k lines/generations).\n\nThe following keyboard shortcuts are available:\n\n- space : toggle simulation updates (pause/play)\n- r : randomize environment\n- x : start/stop recording\n- f : toggle scroll speed (fast/slow)\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nIosevka typeface licensed under OFL-1.1 license\n\nhttps://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and https://thi.ng",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",
