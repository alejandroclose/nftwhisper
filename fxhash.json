Pages of stunning destruction, leaving me in awe.\n\nThis is my generative take on the subject. An attempt to evoke the power of that one panel in a cohesive collection.\n\nEverything procedurally generated at runtime.\nYou can find more info on the composition here : https://ulucode.com/wp/takashis-death/\n\nExport a PNG capture at various resolutions by pressing the number keys 1 to 9 (top row or numpad, and only in live mode, after pressing \"open\"). Resolutions ranges from 720 to 7680 pixels ( height ). I recommend starting with \"4\".\n\nMore features are available, but a decent GPU is recommended:\n- Press \"space\" to toggle an animation on/off\n- Press \"u\" to Unlock the camera. You can then :\n. Mouse left : Rotate\n. Mouse middle/wheel : Zoom\n. Mouse right : Translate\n. \"r\" : reset camera\n. \"a\" : change antialiasing quality : 3 settings in rotation.

            "description": "Inland Emotions\n\nOver the centuries, ancient philosophers and modern psychologists have come to the same basic conclusion. The fact is that, according to a few millennia of research, there are a limited number of distinct human emotions, predefined by the human psyche. Sometimes it may seem like we are experiencing a \"new\" one, but on closer inspection, we see that it is the known emotions that are superimposed. Emotions are what they are, and they exist in the same way in each of us, whether we recognize them for what they are or not. But as our history blends into a new emerging state of the world, a whole new range of emotional responses are triggered within us. An infinite maelstrom of variations generated from a simple combination of a few emotions.\n\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nInland Emotions by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "This generative art token was created as a collaboration between artist Kristen Applegate and the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC. The connection was made when NFT museum founder, Robert Matheson, made a presentation about NFTs to the Art + Design students of Lander University. Shortly afterward Kristen and the graduate students of Lander toured the #Cryptografik generative art exhibition. Kristen expressed interest in minting her custom cross-stitch designs as NFTs. She has since minted multiple “Saints & Martyrs” NFTs on Objkt and now her first generative art token on fxhash. \n\nOver several weeks Kristen and Robert coded side-by-side to create this generative token titled “Rosemaling I”. The outputs are functional cross-stitch patterns that can be used to create IRL pieces of embroidered art.\n\nWe share 33% of future royalties with the original minters in an effort to encourage the promotion of fxhash artists and raise awareness of generative art on the blockchain. We want this art to spread far and wide. Thank you for your support in helping us accomplish this goal.\n\n\nToken Details:\n\nRosemaling I\nCollab by kmappleg8 x NFTMuseumSC\nJune 2022\nfxhash Compliant NFT\n\n\nArtist Bio:\n\nkmappleg8 is an artist and assistant professor in the Department of Art + Design at Lander University in Greenwood, SC. She is new to coding and generative art but not to digital design. She eagerly awaits the time when her coding skills will enable her to bring more complex ideas to fruition. When not in the classroom or in front of her laptop, she can be found making pretty good ceramic work and mediocre flower beds.\n\n\nArtist Statement\n\nRosemaling, or rose painting, is a decorative folk art that flourished in Norway in the 18th and 19th centuries when the Baroque and Rococo artistic styles of the upper class were introduced into Norway's rural culture. The stylized ornamentation is characterized by fantasy flowers, scrollwork, and flowing patterns. It initially adorned church walls, but I encountered it on common use items such as the bowls, stools, chairs, boxes, and trunks at my grandmother’s house. Although she herself was not a rosemaling artist, several other female relatives were accomplished in the technique. \n\nThe “Rosemaling I” series is a first experiment with making generative art using simple patterns for traditional rosemaling designs. Although typically associated with folk painting, the 3 compositions in this series are cross stitch patterns, with each glyph signifying a particular color of thread. Theoretically anyone could print one of the generative designs, purchase the corresponding 18 colors of thread, and create a cross stitch. However at 14 stitches per inch, the final product would be only about 3” x 3”. More complex things to come.\n\n\nInteractions:\n\n- Press 's' to save .png\n\n\nAdditional Credits and Attributions:\n\n- Coded using p5js: https://p5js.org/ \n\n\nAbout the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC:\n\nEstablished in October of 2021, the mission of the Non-Fungible Token Museum is to provide a physical and virtual space for NFT art education, collaboration and exhibition in an effort to help our communities benefit from emerging blockchain technologies.

            "description": "Decoramata is an ancestor of Quartzamata (Project #24402), my recently published generative art series in which I introduce the concept of \"Decorated Cells\" and use it for visualization of Cellular Automata. I created Decoramata, and its decorated cells, in late August 2022, but it stayed a stealth project until now. In a turn and twist of fate, Quartzamata got published first, finally unlocking Decoramata. \n\nA Decoramata's cells are not mere flat squares on a 2D grid, colored with 2, 4, or even 8 colors. Instead, each cell is a high-dimensional object with multiple colors and decorated with multiple shapes. Decorated cells add an extra layer of visual beauty and complexity to CA patterns, turning them into objects and structures with intricate repeating patterns of colorful shapes and symbols, reminiscent of many types of human-made artifacts, such as wallpapers, tapestries, rugs, textiles, mosaics, embroidery, beadwork, and lace. \n\nDecoramata is a direct descendent of my first CA series, AutomataLands (a small curated collection on Objkt.com). Just like AutomataLands, Decoramata have one or more bands of regular CAs, each with its own rules and decorations. Some Decoramata are shiny and polished, while others are grungy and rustic. The rustic ones may look slightly different on different browsers. Decoramata come in a range of scales, and in two scheme of colors.\n\n\nControls:\nPress 's' to save a screenshot as a PNG file.

            "description": "Quartzamata thinks outside the box; yet it is framed inside a box. Looking with fresh eyes, it explores how the visualization of 1D Cellular Automata can be elevated to higher dimensions and heights. \n\nIn my previously published generative artworks utilizing CAs, I had explored novel ways of coloring them (in AutomataLands); used them to texturize and colorize other generative works (in AutomataPunks); and had planted mixed species of such lacy colorful CAs on curved 3D surfaces (in Cellulaire).\n\nIn Quartzamata, I turn CA visualizations into high dimensional objects and sculptures. A Quartzamata's cells are not mere flat squares on a 2D grid, colored with 2, 4, or even 8 colors. Instead, each cell is a complex, decorated, and colorful 3D object. What creates a Quartzamata's global 3D form and structure is the bending and twisting, and carving and shaping, of the cells and their 2D grid in a multitude of ways. And while some Quartzamata are static and lifeless, others are dynamic and alive organisms.\n\nThe novel concept of decorating CA cells, that I am introducing in Quartzamata, adds an extra layer of visual beauty and complexity to CA patterns; it turns them into objects and structures with intricate repeating patterns of colorful shapes and symbols, reminiscent of many types of human-made artifacts, such as wallpapers, tapestries, rugs, textiles, mosaics, embroidery, beadwork, and lace.\n\nQuartzamata twists and turns, and just like a key it unlocks the box that contains its predecessors; exotic species of CA that not only exhibited richer and more complex patterns, but also were the first to stealthily acquire the gene for decorated cells. And that's another twist and turn; this one in the lineage of Quartzamata itself.\n\nGrab a key, spot the puns, and have some fun!\n\nControls:\nUse 'h' to turn the interactive mode off/on, and to save energy.\nWhen in interactive mode use: \n\t'b' : to hide/reveal the box framing the Quartzamata. \n\t'n' : to remove/add the noisy texture/aura around the Quartzamata.\n\t'c' : to add/remove background color. \n\t'l' (small L) : to turn lights on/off. The mouse controls the location of the light source. \n\tleft/right arrows : to set the Quartzamata into rotating left/right. \n\tup/down arrows : to speed up/down the rotation. \n\t'p' : to pause the rotation.\n\t'f' : to toggle on/off the full-screen mode. Note that resizing the screen resets the scene.\n\t's' : to save a screenshot as a PNG file. Maximize your browser window to maximize the size of the PNG.\nTo enable high-resolution screenshots, add the following to the end of the URL: ?HD=1\nUse the mouse/trackball/touch to move around the Quartzamata. Turning off the noise and lights help speed up navigation. The more complex a Quartzamata, the heavier and thus harder it is to move around.\n\nLicense:\nSee included LICENSE.md\n\nCredits:\nMade in p5js and WebGL.\n\nArtist: Vida V.",

It was made with two free small, lightweight softwares like kidpix.app and magicavoxel, using the @PureSpider template to create iterations. This collection  is produced from technological limitations, a socioeconomic condition implies a determined political position and this is reflected on the access to technology, mainly the access to hardware.\nAs an artist, not having access to specialized high-tech hardware and software made my workflow, or the way I approach art, different, putting me in a place where I had to open myself and embrace low-poly or low-res alternatives to continue making art.\n\n‘Low-Res’ has 50 MagicaVoxel models in 3D and 6 backgrounds made in kidpix.app, in each piece, the features combinations build corny poems, which give each piece an unique spirit and name. These poems work as a continuation of the Digital Collage collection.\n\nHigh res tech has often been a vector of cultural hegemony over the global south, especially in terms of access to the tech- Sabatobox @sabatobox\n",

            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.
