            "description": "Brushstroke is an algorithm to form a minimal, modern, artistic paint on a canvas. It mimics a painter's hand gesture to apply different types of strokes. Those strokes may vary from thin straight lines to fat curvy arcs. The direction of the strokes may change for each stroke or not. There may be an excessive amount of them as there may be just several. Strokes may intersect and form a group. It generates color palettes as an artist does. There are more than twenty parameters that give variety to pieces. \n\nBrushstroke is built on the p5.js library. As a way of saying thanks, you will contribute to the Processing Foundation by collecting this work. ",

Bounds around line generation properties were set loosely, resulting in many possible line characters with unique weights, wobbles, and more.  Lines are generated in individual layered segments one by one, resulting in a pleasing animation of gradual composition as they compose one of twelve possible shapes, in one of eight possible color schemes.  \n\nEach \"line\" is made up of thousands of points, and so rendering the live view of this piece may be computer intensive.  As an added bonus a small amount of proprietary line data is emitted to the development console, allowing the minted collection to serve as a palette of potential line qualities for the artist to use in future works.  Any owners of pieces used in this way by the artist on future projects will be granted a share of said future project's royalties.\n\nIn active live view, press [1] to view medium res, [2] to view high res, and [0] to return to original viewport width view.\n\nWritten in vanilla JavaScript without the use of external libraries.",

They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "The Corium is a roughly spherical mass (diameter ~1km), of currently unknown origins situated within the core region of the solar system's asteroid belt.\nThe body was discovered during a uranium extraction mission undertaken by ET Resources at the behest of Station 733-H (Mars colony) leadership, when ionising radiation levels detected by deployed surface craft exceeded equipment and personnel tolerance levels by many orders of magnitude.\n\nWhile ETR crew were quick to respond to local abort orders (27 minutes from initial readings to fleet reorientation); Station 733-H made the determination that radiation exposure levels were already far in excess of anything that could be reasonably mitigated upon the ETR fleet's return.\nThe ETR fleet was ordered to jettison fuel reserves under Section 9 of the Space Corporations Act (Mars) approximately 90 minutes after the readings were initially reported. It is understood that all deployed personnel accessed their barbiturate rations within the following 24 hours.\n\nThe fleet itself remains in position some ~3000kms from The Corium, with plans to relocate the vessels still underway (albeit a low priority).\n\n\nSTATION 733-H OBSERVATION REPORT SUMMARY (14.1.1)\n\nTo date, remote analysis suggests that the body is compositionally similar to corium deposits observed following terrestrial nuclear disasters, consisting of a range of solidified radioactive compounds as well as a number of currently unidentified metal alloys. More in-depth analysis has been impossible to date due to the rapid physical decay of personnel and equipment as their proximity to samples reach a critical threshold.\n\nAll samples have so far been extruded from the surface of The Corium via laser, and maneuvered into orbit around Mars at the edge of it's sphere of influence (at a distance of no less than 50,000kms from Station 733-H), via projectile barrage and gas envelopment.\n\nThe surface of The Corium itself is littered with an array of clearly engineered forms; radial and rectangular patterns, deep crevasses, mazes and grids with only a select few areas resembling the pools of lava observed where Corium has formed terrestrially (it is unclear whether these deposits have formed since the surface was initially engineered).\n\nThe accompanying files are LIDAR renders of the extracted samples in proximity to Station 733-H and are marked for dissemination to terrestrial research teams on Mars. Study of The Corium remains the sole priority of Station 733-H research personnel, as any risks presented to the solar system or its inhabitants are currently not well understood.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe piece will render from the top right and might take ~5-10 seconds to begin.\n\nAppend \"&print=true\" to the live render URL for a hi-res output.",

Through years of growing in fluxed vapor, its knots and roots construct organized and rhythmic patterns within chaotic orders. From two-dimensional layouts to three-dimensional composition, “Magnolia” absorbs its fundamental image, and extend it even further — creating the core of generative artwork.\n\nPress \"s\" to download",
