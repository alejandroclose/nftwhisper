            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands.

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands.

            "description": "by Daeinc\nMay 2022\n\nAn exploration into time and motion. Two linear timelines - structural and surficial - are intertwined. By weaving these timelines at different points in time, almost infinite variations can be made. The changing relationship between the two creates dynamic and unique compositions and challenges the visual perception.\n\n## Guide:\n- Please note that the animation responds to window aspect ratio. This is an intentional behavior as part of interactivity. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- To export image at specific size, use URL parameters as below.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.3.1 with Chrome 101.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction:\n- [0] for exhibit. it switches to a different mode every 3 loops.\n- [s] to export PNG image. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause animation\n- [1 ~ 5] for different play modes\n- [1]: all \n- [2]: surficial \n- [3]: constant \n- [4]: all-constant\n- [5]: structural\n- [h] to toggle hi-DPI mode. (for retina display)\n\n## URL Parameters:\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&mode=exhibit&w=800&st=5.3\n- [mode]: play mode (exhibit, all, surficial, constant, all-constant, structural)\n- [w]: width.

            "description": "Everything is divisible. Larger organisms are made up of smaller ones, entire galaxies are comprised of stars, planets, people, dust, and one effect here and now ripples into eternity. Nothing exists without the elemental components that have evolved to make them possible — and nothing on the plane of existence arrives in isolation from something greater. This enmeshed reality is the concept of a Holon: a whole that is simultaneously part of another whole. \n\nAs cells, energies, beings, and ideas grow in complexity, each new advancement includes and transcends their holons, the very catalysts of evolution. What does this essential process look like on its own when scale, context, and definition are removed? The senses are forced to purely observe the present interactions and reactions that occur between all parts. This is what Holons attempts to portray — the witnessing of birth, formation, and crystallization simultaneously. \n\nUpon viewing each piece and inspecting its detail with curiosity — we can observe living reality that has been temporarily suspended from motion and artificially stopped for us to witness. Can we see what is a part, and what is a whole? Can we define what these holons are? \n\nLet each Holons remind us that the impossible can always be made; let each one be nothing and everything — organisms, cosmos, energy itself — all at once, for it’s the creation of something entirely new that best reminds us that everything is actually made of the parts already here. So, remember to create without barriers or limitations because reality itself is made of that which lives now only in imagination.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x flight404\nOctober 2022\n\nPress ‘h’ in live view to render a high resolution version of any token.\nPress ‘s’ in live view to save a .png of the current view of any token.\n\nHolons was created in vanilla Javascript and WebGL, but the majority of the work was done in GLSL shaders. This setup was substantially assisted by fx(hash) community leader and artist Liam Egan who provided technical assistance and emotional support during the project's lifespan. For this reason, we have included him in the split of proceeds.\n",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.

Smaller grasses form groups, alliances making it harder for taller ones to take over. Dead leaves remind us that some of them lost the fight, fallen warriors who, soon enough, will be forgotten too. Growth, decay, life, death, the endless cycle, right in front of our eyes.\n\nIt is fascinating, and, for me at least, an endless source of inspiration.\n\nIt is my hope that, through this project, you will take the time to take a closer look at nature, and that, as the pale blue dot we call home keeps getting drier and drier, remember that even humble patches of grass should not be taken for granted.\n\n\nKey commands:\n's' - save as png\n'b' - make the background transparent (for printing)\n'1', '2, '4' - set the pixel density, for resolutions up to 8000x8000\n\nThis updated version of the project should render on mobile devices, albeit with slightly reduced quality. \nIf you want to save the image for printing, I recommend you do so on desktop.\n",
