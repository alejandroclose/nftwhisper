Differences in pressure, temperature, state, all act in pursuit of equilibrium. Given enough time, a closed system will eventually fall into an even dispersal. Somewhere in between is some yet-to-be-determined point at which beautiful unexpected forms emerge.\n\nThis system takes the standard model of equal exchange and throws it off balance, so each reaction will randomly decide which side has an advantage over the other, and instead of dispersal, one force will win out.\n\nIn this system, do similar complex patterns appear? Will we see anything new that doesn't appear with our usual rules?\n\nI found this idea very interesting, that even with no law towards chaos, actually the opposite, we can still end in formlessness. A blank end where no pixel differs from another.\n\nI think that through observation of the world and experimenting with its concepts, we can learn far more about life than just the processes we're studying. \n\nI'd be very curious to hear about what you take away from the work, and where your somewhere might be <3\n\nPress the space bar to add another step toward chaos\nPress ‘p’ to add 10 steps (enters mode 2)\nPress ‘f’ to enter an animation that will run for 1,056,993,066,125,486,216,810,417,723,659,732,792 years\nPress 'f' again to pause\nPress ‘a’ to add a new section of order to the system, you can use this when one state has taken over the canvas\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png\nPress ‘1’ or ‘2’ to begin render between the default 3200x4000px or 6400x8000px\n\nCreated by Chris McCully using p5.js, chroma.js, and GLSL.\n\nBuilt to run best on Chrome and Chromium based browsers.",

            "description": "“Bleaching” is the third episode of “The Restoration Scheme” Series. The work was based on Acropora digitifera. \n\nCorals derive their colors from symbiotic algae. With the change of environment, such as rising water temperature, symbiotic algae leave the coral and therefore it becomes white. Coral bleaching does not mean death, but it does mean that the coral has lost its source of nutrients without symbiotic algae. The coral will be starving to death little by little if the environment does not improve.\n\n——\n\n“The Restoration Scheme” Series\nIt’s a virtual action extended from the coral restoration plan led by Delta Electronics Foundation from Taiwan, consisting of five generative corals. Each of them was based on five different species of coral as the theme.\nIf collectors mint virtual corals, Delta Electronics Foundation will drop coral seedlings collectively in the sea. \n\nThe project is powered by FAB DAO (Formosa Art Bank). The split will donate to the local organization from Taiwan dedicated to the coral restoration scheme.\n\n——\n\nAbout Delta \nClimate change is causing irreversible impacts. Coral reefs, known for their rich biodiversity and the capability to nourish a quarter of marine life, are at the forefront of the crisis. Also known as \"tropical rainforests\" in the sea, coral reefs have experienced five mass bleaching events in the past five years. Once global warming exceeds the 2˚C thresholds, it's likely that 99% of coral reefs will die off worldwide.\n\nIn addition to launching a coral restoration initiative along the northeast coast of Taiwan, Delta Electronics Foundation collaborates with Asia University to host \"Earth Pulsing: Nurturing Life Exhibition\" and releases the first art NFT featuring coral restoration. Through these actions, we hope to evoke public awareness of ecological issues. For more information, please visit https://delta50.deltaww.com/initiative/sea.html\n\n——\n\n35 ~ 60 corals to render. You might need some patience for the result.\n\ndouble click or press 's' to save as an image\nmade with p5.js and chroma.js\n\n____________________________\n\n《白化》為《恢復方案》系列第三作，品種為指形軸孔珊瑚。\n\n珊瑚的顏色來自共生藻，隨著環境變化（如水溫上升），共生藻離開了珊瑚，珊瑚露出了白色。所以珊瑚白化其實不等於死亡，但共生藻的離開意味著珊瑚失去了養分來源。在環境沒有改善的狀況下，珊瑚就會慢慢餓死。\n\n——\n\n《恢復方案》\n恢復方案是虛擬演算珊瑚實驗，一系列共五件的生成珊瑚作品，每一件對應到特定珊瑚物種。本實驗與台達電子文教基金會合作，藏家每收藏一件 NFT，台達電子文教基金會就會實際在海中植下一株對應的珊瑚苗。這項專案與 FAB DAO （福爾摩沙藝術銀行）支援鑄造，部分分潤將直接捐助給台灣在地珊瑚保育組織，詳細資訊將於 FAB DAO Twitter 公佈。\n\n——\n\n關於台達電子文教基金會氣候變遷引發許多不可逆的環境衝擊，以豐富生物多樣性著稱、滋養四分之一海洋生物的珊瑚，便是首當其衝的受害者。\n被譽為「海中熱帶雨林」的珊瑚生態系，已在最近五年遭遇三次大白化，一旦升溫跨越攝氏2℃，屆時恐有多達99％的珊瑚瀕臨滅絕。\n近年在東北角投入珊瑚復育的台達電子文教基金會，今年與亞洲大學共同策畫「地球˙脈動中」生態與藝術特展，並合作發行全台首見的珊瑚生成藝術NFT，喚起社會大眾對生態議題的重視。更多資訊可參考: https://delta50.deltaww.com/initiative/sea.html",

This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels.
