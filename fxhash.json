            "description": "Flowers and Sky\n\nUsing natural brushstrokes and bright colors, this generative system creates stunning scenes of flower-filled meadows under a brilliant sky. It is inspired by the masters of impressionist art and aims to capture the beauty of nature.\n\nEvery leaf, petal, cloud, and sunray are generated from code using simulated brushstrokes. The flowers and trees are suggestive only and do not depict real species.\n\nThere are 8 formal features that have many values in order to generate a wide variety of outputs. The only rare feature is a SkyMode of 'Eclipse' which occurs in 3% of the outputs.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis is a 100% code generated project. Outputs are created at a default resolution of 1500 x 1000.\n\nClick on the output and use these keys to change the resolution or save the output:\n's' - save at current resolution\n\n'2' - change to  3000 x 2000 resolution\n'3' - change to  4500 x 3000 resolution\n...\n'8' - change to 12000 x 8000 resolution\n\nURL Parameters: You can also set the resolution in the url.\nTo change the resolution append &res=2 (or 3-8)\n\nCopyright 2023 Jeff Clark",

            "description": "\"A mille-feuille (French pronunciation: ​[mil fœj], \"thousand-sheets\"), also known by the names Napoleon, vanilla slice, and custard slice, is a dessert made of puff pastry layered with pastry cream. Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.\n\nTraditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry (pâte feuilletée), alternating with two layers of pastry cream (crème pâtissière). The top pastry layer is finished in various ways: sometimes it is topped with whipped cream, or it may be dusted with icing sugar, cocoa, pastry crumbs, or sliced almonds. It may also be glazed with icing or fondant alone, or in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) or other colored icing stripes, and combed to create a marbled effect.\" — Wikipedia\n\nPrints available upon request: prints@stefancontiero.com\nBest enjoyed on browsers supporting Display-P3 color gamut.\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n@stefan_contiero\n",

            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

The series is inspired by the captivating beauty of water, a source of fascination for both artists and it features two distinctive palettes, each created by one of the artists. \n\nThe endless real time animation captures the essence of water, its ever-changing form, and the interplay of light and shadow. It creates a sense of movement and dynamism, immersing the viewer in a world of fluidity and serene beauty.\n\nEach token has an original set of characteristics, randomly determined by the hash from the following options:\n\n• Color palettes (JG or MCHX)\n• Animation speed (Ocean, River or Waterfall) and direction (North or South)\n• Number of cascades (1, 2, 3 or 4)\n• Number of color sets (2, 4, 7 or 13)\n\nDon't forget to click on the canvas to change the color combinations! We hope you enjoy it! 🙂\n\nJG & MCHX. 2023.",

            "description": "All generative art on fx(hash) comes about through a unique collaboration between artist and minter. Each artwork has a deterministic component provided by the artist, the generative algorithm, and a random component provided by the minter, the transaction hash. The minter creates the random component, the hash, through the act of minting a token and leaving a transaction record on the blockchain. In this way, the minter is permanently linked to the specific iteration that they personally created.\n\nTo celebrate this collaborative effort between artist and minter, this collection dedicates all royalties from secondary sales to the respective minting wallets. Primary proceeds, on the other hand, will be sent to a smart contract wallet collecting funds in support of humanitarian aid in Ukraine. For details, see: https://twitter.com/fx_hash_/status/1497113575466360837.\n\nThe core generative algorithm employed is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), implemented in AssemblyScript and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for maximum performance. The WASM code is embedded into a JavaScript program that generates an input dataset, runs it through the t-SNE algorithm, and then visualizes the output with colored dots. The final artwork is a static SVG file that can be downloaded and displayed at any resolution. All color palettes are computationally generated and have random components. No external libraries have been used.\n\nCode and outputs are Copyright (C) 2022 Claus O. Wilke and are licensed to the general public under CC BY-NC 4.0. In addition, token holders are granted a non-exclusive, irrevocable, non-transferrable license to reproduce the output corresponding to their token, in any medium, for any purpose, inluding for commercial gain, for as long as they hold the token.\n\nPress 's' to save as svg.\n\nPress 'p' to save as png.\n\nAuthor:\nClaus O.

            "description": "\"Bored Computer Screen\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Art Basel, Basel 2022\n\n\nBored Computer Screen (BCS) is a direct descendant of Specter👻pixel⬛latte☕, where the central idea is agent and displacement. In BCS, there are agents—the small moving circles—that get their colors ripped away by the surrounding pixels. Though they occur on the same screen space, they are separated in their own cells, a simultaneous multiverse of sorts. In some iterations, a very clear voronoi pattern will appear. I didn't consciously strive for this look. It's what naturally happens, when you try to divide space, so that the borders occur exactly in between the closest neighbor. When I first saw this pattern emerge, I wanted to see how far I could get the distinct cells to influence each other. The idea that the same algorithmic processes can happen many times but still separately in a single piece has always interested me (and explored in the Infinite Browse series). BCS is an extension of that, albeit a little more chaotic.\n\nNote:\n- Best experience on browsers and devices with support for WebGL2 \n\nMade by Sam Tsao (@sam___tsao) with P5, P5Fbo and perlinjs.\n",

Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",
