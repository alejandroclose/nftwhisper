            "description": "Polar Grid is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, London 2022.\n\nThis is a study of color, motion, and composition, and an homage to cinema as an artform. Colorful shapes overlap and pulse in a ever repeating dance. An abstracted movie experience. Each color palette in the series (except one) is inspired by a different film director (if you want a real challenge, see how many you can guess without looking at the feature names).\n\nThe palettes were extracted from movie stills or movie posters and fine tuned by hand. As often, I have to thank independent tool makers for their indirect help. My gratitude goes to David Aerne for FarbVélo and Fabrizio Bianchi for Coolors.\n\nThe code for Polar Grid is based on early iterations of what ultimately became my carat series. Both projects come from the same fascination for color as a system, even though I used a different approach here. You could call this a carat prequel.\n\nThe animation is done using a technique called polar noise. This makes it so the motion of all elements ends up repeating in the same amount of time. This is useful for generating motion that loops perfectly while still appearing organic. In this particular case, the animation repeats every π × 100 seconds.\n\nA challenge in building any generative system is to find the right balance between coherence and variety. I designed the system with the large edition size in mind. During development I generated hundreds of iterations and tweaked my code to make sure that every iteration is truly unique and fits the overall aesthetic of the collection.\n\nI truly hope you will enjoy your own little abstract movie.\n\n— Raphaël de Courville\n\n\nReleased: July 6th 2022\n\nMedium: p5.js, html canvas, css\n\nReference: sk220621\n\n\n**About the artist**\n\nRaphaël de Courville is a generative artist, streamer, and educator.

            "description": "Let me take you places. Those are not in your town, not even on your planet. They’re placed somewhere between reality and subconsciousness.\nEnormous, peculiar structures emerge upon you, refusing to be ignored. They are your unfulfilled cravings or ever-lurking demons. They were always there, under your skin, intangible, now they’ve materialized.\nYou may not like them, they may seem too vast, too scary to tame. But ultimately, you have to face them, unless you enjoy living in their shadow. \n\n___\nInspirations\n\nI’ve never truly realized that, but ever since I remember, the sight of gigantic objects or creatures evoked strong emotions within me.\nIt probably started with playing Shadow of Colossus (a video game) as a kid and seeing The Cathedral (short movie by Tomasz Bagiński). Years later, reading Solaris (by Stanisław Lem) aroused the same feeling (among others) of being mesmerized by the vastness. More recently, movies like Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival (which also nudged my attraction to mystery) and Dune - have charmed me.\n\nEarlier this year I have stumbled across Dawid Planeta (artist and yoga teacher) and began contemplating his visions of mini people in the jungle inhabited by giant animals. These works in particular, plus Hollow - generative series by Jacek Markusiewicz - were probably my final inspirations to make Intangible look the way it does.\n\nSettling semi-random generative structures in some kind of reality, gave them a meaning - they may symbolize things much bigger than you - the ones you try to escape from or those you’ve been longing to experience for years. I have mine, don’t you?\n\n___\nControls in live mode\n\n\nKeyboard\n[ space ] - toggle light animation\n[ S ] - save image with current size (default is 120% of browser window’s height; you may change browser’s scale or check URL size param)\n[ F ] - fullscreen \n[ up / down ] - light intensity\n[ left / right ] - base light position\n[ 1..5 ] - aspect ratio: 10:16 („zero” ratio), 1:1.4142 (vertical A4), 1:1, 1.4142 (horizontal A4), 16:10\n[ B ] - toggle border\n[ Z ] - toggle canvas „raw” mode - no shadow / margin (auto applied in fullscreen mode)\n[ N ] - toggle „that thing you may not want on print”\n\n\nURL params\nYou may add any number of parameters to the URL to start it with particular settings. \n[ animate ] (1/0) - toggle light animation\n[ size] (number) - number of px for longer edge, i.e. 4000\n[ ratio ] (number or ratio with format: 10/16, 10:16, 10_16) - aspect ratio\n[ light ] (number 40..120, some palettes have slightly different limits for good results) - light intensity\n[ lightShift] (number -100..100) - base light position\n[ border ] (1/0) - toggle border\n[ hddcy ] (0/1)\n\nExample: [ &size=4000&border=1&light=100&animate=1 ] \n\n\nMobile\n[hold 2 fingers for 2s] - save\n[double tap] - fullscreen\n\n\n___\nNote:\nI encourage you to do some light adjustments before you save an image for print. I’m pretty sure you can do better than fxrand().\n\n\n___\nSpecial thanks to my brother Krzycho, for lots of advices / heathy criticism and to Olga, for never-ending excitement and „dorady”.\n\n___\nDeveloped in Javascript, using p5.js (2D Canvas) and chroma.js.\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n© April-July 2022, MadeUpLifeforms (mulf)\n",

            "description": "\"Balancium\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Art Basel, Basel 2022\n\nIn the fall of 1931, in Alexander Calder's studio, Marcel Duchamp coined the term 'mobile' for his kinetic sculptures. Later, Calder wrote: \"This, in French, means not only 'movable'— but also a 'motive', 'a reason for an act' so I found it a very good word.\"\n \nAround the same year, Bruno Munari started making colorful and whimsical mobiles. He called them \"useless machines\", existing without any purpose and inviting viewers to just look. Elements are connected with nearly invisible threads or wires, allowing the artist to create the illusion of shapes floating in the air.\n\nBalancium is both a virtual mobile and a useless object. Generated by the code, it undergoes a continual transformation. The movement of the air, or invisible fluid, becomes an integral part of the design and amplifies serenity. \n \nThere is a keyboard key that unlocks more variations.",

In BCS, there are agents—the small moving circles—that get their colors ripped away by the surrounding pixels. Though they occur on the same screen space, they are separated in their own cells, a simultaneous multiverse of sorts. In some iterations, a very clear voronoi pattern will appear. I didn't consciously strive for this look. It's what naturally happens, when you try to divide space, so that the borders occur exactly in between the closest neighbor. When I first saw this pattern emerge, I wanted to see how far I could get the distinct cells to influence each other. The idea that the same algorithmic processes can happen many times but still separately in a single piece has always interested me (and explored in the Infinite Browse series). BCS is an extension of that, albeit a little more chaotic.\n\nNote:\n- Best experience on browsers and devices with support for WebGL2 \n\nMade by Sam Tsao (@sam___tsao) with P5, P5Fbo and perlinjs.\n",

Smooth-brained is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, London 2022.\n\nThe initial visual idea for ‘Smooth-brained’ was to use one pixel and a two-colour gradient in multiple ways across a grid, using repetition, orientation, placement and scale, resulting in a visual composition that became the genesis piece. From that original artwork, Murat took the premise and through creative-coding, began to expand and experiment on the parameters, introducing new visual possibilities and paving the way for this collaborative generative art collection. The beauty of a gradient is that it gives the impression of depth and form on a 2D surface. This allows the visual fields to seem outward and also inward while giving the impression of movement within the whole piece and within individual cells; conjuring up spaces within spaces. The compositions are meant to be spaces for the eye to roam, decorative yet functional, complex yet minimal, a place where the brain is pleased and not duly complicated - a state of ‘smooth-brained’.\n\nPress 1 to 8 export PNG between 1000px to 8000px ",

Smooth-brained is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, London 2022.\n\nThe initial visual idea for ‘Smooth-brained’ was to use one pixel and a two-colour gradient in multiple ways across a grid, using repetition, orientation, placement and scale, resulting in a visual composition that became the genesis piece. From that original artwork, Murat took the premise and through creative-coding, began to expand and experiment on the parameters, introducing new visual possibilities and paving the way for this collaborative generative art collection. The beauty of a gradient is that it gives the impression of depth and form on a 2D surface. This allows the visual fields to seem outward and also inward while giving the impression of movement within the whole piece and within individual cells; conjuring up spaces within spaces. The compositions are meant to be spaces for the eye to roam, decorative yet functional, complex yet minimal, a place where the brain is pleased and not duly complicated - a state of ‘smooth-brained’.\n\nPress 1 to 8 export PNG between 1000px to 8000px ",

            "description": "A Generative Art Project by Matthew Hawtin & Murat Atimtay. Smooth-brained is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, London 2022.\n\nThe initial visual idea for ‘Smooth-brained’ was to use one pixel and a two-colour gradient in multiple ways across a grid, using repetition, orientation, placement and scale, resulting in a visual composition that became the genesis piece. From that original artwork, Murat took the premise and through creative-coding, began to expand and experiment on the parameters, introducing new visual possibilities and paving the way for this collaborative generative art collection. The beauty of a gradient is that it gives the impression of depth and form on a 2D surface. This allows the visual fields to seem outward and also inward while giving the impression of movement within the whole piece and within individual cells; conjuring up spaces within spaces. The compositions are meant to be spaces for the eye to roam, decorative yet functional, complex yet minimal, a place where the brain is pleased and not duly complicated - a state of ‘smooth-brained’.\n\nPress 1 to 8 export PNG between 1000px to 8000px ",

(maybe that center is you.)\n\nmaybe that curve is a relationship. (or a job.) (or repressed trauma that needs processing.)\n\nmaybe that curve has other curves within. (it probably does.)\n\nsometimes there are many curves at once. (usually this the case.) \n\noccasionally, there may only be one. (life isn’t always so complicated.) \n\nwhatever curves the moment contains it can help to step away and see how they come together.
