            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

Auction will stop changing price when non-reserves are fully minted.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nNature’s wild flourish and untamed growth wondrously represent the exacting function of beauty — a function that is at once useful and infinitely creative. Perhaps nowhere is this delicate symbiosis better observed than in the flower, wherein a pure balance of physical fundamentals exists beneath ornate patterns and elaborate aesthetics.\n\nAmongst the layers of undulating, vividly colored petals, attention-grabbing stigma and stamen, and lusciously decorative features, nature’s organic abundance and disorder disguises its masterful propensity for precision. Each of the flower’s components evolve through unpredictable interactions with an unwieldy natural environment, creating spectacular adaptations that emerge from the tension between what attracts.\n\nRococo painters appreciated the organic fluidity found in flowers and vegetal forms, using their joyful abundance to depict a break from the rigid and stoic period the artists hoped to leave behind. They sought to reframe perfection away from predictability and toward compositions as surprising as the natural world around them.\n\nThus, ‘Rococo’ is a generative distortion of an old tradition: a digital painting created entirely with code that interprets and processes the natural world’s dichotomies. This painting algorithm builds upon natural structures while melding and moving their colors beyond form, growing randomly organic iterations that are as perfect as they are imperfect.\n\nCreated by Ori Ben-Shabat & Ronen Tanchum @Phenomenalabs\nCreative contributions from Tender @tender_art\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTechnical Details:\n\n- Mobile/GPU Intensive\n- Press “s” to save a .png of the artwork in live view\n- Press “p” to render a high res output + press “s” to save a printable .png",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",
