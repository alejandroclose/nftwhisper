This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

            "description": "The old master made thousands of drawings during centuries. Always starting with tiny dots, thin strokes, short and long lines that could shape textures where light bounces and shadow diffuses. Thanks to his formula, he could draw anything that we know and that we don’t know. And that’s what he did, and because of that, people named him the master. But one day, ages ago, no one cared anymore about words and things, and because of that, he left out the figures, the landscapes, animals, plants and objects, and even the deities and their symbols. “I can’t stop drawing”, his hand said to him. “Then we draw”, the master answered. “Look at this pebble the many ricochets it’s having upon the clear and calm water. From now on, we have to draw like this. Repetition, refraction, randomness, intuition, gesture. Take a sheet and give the first stroke.” And something new happened, something both bright and dark. Light and shadows merged into chiaroscuro.\n\n- - -\n\n“Ses idées ressemblent à des carreaux de vitres, entassées dans un panier de vitrier, claires une à une, et obscures toutes ensemble.” - Jules Renard.\n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 3000 × 4500 px).\nFor higher resolution, add to the URL ”&size=n” (where 4 = 4000 × 6000 px / 5 = 5000 × 7500 px / 6 = 6000 × 9000 px / 7 = 7000 × 10500 px / 8 = 8000 × 12000 px). Rendering may last for high numbers.\nWe recommend the use of Chrome browser in order to render properly the texture. Also because of the moiré effect, scaling or zooming could alter the perception of the work, not its essence.\n\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 3000 × 4500 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.net",

This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",
