            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

Whether it's the facial recognition unlock system on smartphones or crowd management systems in large venues, facial data is being utilized. However, this data is usually analyzed based on the distance between the contours of the face and the features, rather than the complete \"face\". Therefore, I believe that some digital facial features are blurry and simplified.\n\nThis work draws on the experience of sketching in pixel art, using elements such as dots, lines, and shapes to construct the form of the face, and adding surface points to enrich the details of the digital face.",

Water is also indispensable for the continuation of the life that emerged from - and with - it. The advent of AI species and their introduction into society is a new form of cambrian explosion. What is their medium? What is their water? How scarce and precious will it be for them? AI entities are not foreign to human resource necessities, though. The water that is essential to our human life will also be so for machines, as their energy still depends on our natural resources. Therefore, the ecologies of humans and machines will have, at least, the same elements as the ecologies of humans. AIs may help us reach better balances, only if we employ them to do so and if we teach them to help us.\n\necologías-B is an entity that is part of a broader ecology. Released on occasion of the show \"Unbound - Ecology in the Age of Machines\" at Unit London. The data generated by this entity is read by a different piece minted on Ethereum, creating a link between Tezos and Ethereum, a metaphor for an ecology of blockchains.\n\nit shares a common element with two other works released on fxhash: ecologías A and ecologías C, all of them contributing data to aforementioned pieces.\n\nread more at https://www.iillucid.com/ecologias\n\n15% of primary sales are donated to institutions working towards improving biodiversity and environmental efforts.\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nBuilt on p5.js and p5.Framebuffer (massive thanks and respect to the corresponding authors)\n\nappend &pd=N (N a number) to the URL in live view to increase/decrease resolution\npress s to save current image in current resolution\npress z,x,g,b,n followed by +/- to increase/decrease, respectively, brightness, contrast, gamma, blur, noise\npress l (as in loop) to pause/resume the piece",

I never know what will come out with the next brushstroke or spatula stroke.\nMy thoughts go at supersonic speed and only stop to choose another color. The one just painted is never the right one. So I live the life of the new painting with the sense of mystery that the moonless night has.

It means that the world around us is a reflection of our inner world, and vice versa. Also implies that the universe is a harmonious whole that everything is interconnected.\n\nI use circle, dashed line and transparent filling as a base form to construct a framework that generates images which attempt to represent the mind and thoughts of this verse.\n\nThe \"BaseCircle\" Feature means that how many circle was used as a starting point to expand to the whole canvas. Those rules construct different forms in visuals of harmony . Hope you like the abstract and the concrete of this work.\n\nDone by P5js.

            "description": "How and How Not To Maintain Friendships charts the ways that relationships between people can develop or dissipate over time. Starting from different places, and different degrees of distance or closeness, friendships evolve over time. Sometimes we grow closer to others, sometimes we grow apart. Sometimes this happens quickly, and other times it is slow. Sometimes we become so enmeshed in our friends’s lives that our paths twist together, interlocking and criss-crossing in a shared journey. Other times we may follow mostly parallel paths with a handful of others, some of whom may head off on their own paths at different points down the line. Each of us influences the many people around us in different ways. Like masses suspended in space, friendship works like gravity on the people close to us, sometimes bringing us closer together and sometimes sending us whirling off in new directions.\n\n2022 by LIA (www.liaworks.com)\n\nToken-holder's usage rights:\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",
