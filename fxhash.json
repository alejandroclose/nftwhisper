            "description": "\"Slice of Life\" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

            "description": "\"Mystical Fusion\" is a captivating generative artwork that embarks on a creative journey to simulate the essence of an abstract acrylic painting. This digital masterpiece captures the heart of abstract artistry by leveraging code to recreate the intricate interplay of colors, textures, and the artistic process. Each layer in the artwork contributes to the final composition, with a deliberate focus on embracing both structure and chaos, precision and randomness, and order and imperfection. \nFor an in-depth exploration of the concept and a behind-the-scenes step-by-step journey into its creation, please check out this link. https://www.abdimorris.xyz/post/mystical-fusion\n\nArtist's Note:\n\n- The colors on different screens may appear slightly different due to variations in how different systems handle color rendering.\n- Tested on Mac M2 with Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.\n- Due to the complexity of loops and shaders involved in its creation, the live view may become slow on smaller devices (mobile).\n\nKey commands:\n\nPressing \"1\" sets the pixel density to '1' and saves a 1600x2000 resolution image.\nPressing \"2\" sets the pixel density to '2' and saves a 2400x3000 resolution image.\nPressing \"3\" sets the pixel density to '3' and saves a 3200x4000 resolution image.\nPressing \"4\" sets the pixel density to '4' and saves a 4000x5000 resolution image.\nPressing \"5\" sets the pixel density to '5' and saves a 4800x6000 resolution image.\nPressing \"6\" sets the pixel density to '6' and saves a 5600x7000 resolution image.\n\nWrite in the input field whether you want to save the image as \"png\" or \"jpg\".\nNOTE: Saving png in high-resolution images may take some time.\n\nThis generative art is made using p5.js, Chroma, and WebGL.\n\n================================================================\nfxhash Template by concavepentagon 2023\nLicense: CC-BY 3.0\n\n================================================================\n\nThis generative artwork is licensed under Apache License.\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n2023 by Abdi Morris",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

This piece is a bold exploration of the chaos that surrounds us, transformed into an abstract and otherworldly form.\nIn this artwork, I have incorporated various shapes. Additionally, in this project, I have used an algorithm to arrange rectangles one after the other with different sizes. Overall, it can be said that this is my first project on this platform. The pricing scale for my future projects will be based on this piece. Please be aware that the preview image upload may take between 20 seconds to 3 minutes",

These patterns are both interconnected and independent, symbolizing the complexity and individuality of each person's inner world.\n______________________________________________\n\nThe collection is made in pure code with p5.js and using the excellent chroma.js library.\n\n10% of primary sales are donated to institutions working towards improving biodiversity and environmental efforts.\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 1000 px x 1250 px\n2 = 2000 px x 2500 px\n\n....\n9 = 9000 px x 11250 px\n\ns = export to png using current resolution\n______________________________\nCopyright (c) 2022 WhiteKoala.\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",
