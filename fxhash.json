            "description": "Superimposed Rectangles\n\nThis is the fifth in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nSuperimposed Rectangles is my variation of one of Knowlton’s test examples: Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids (Example 3). As Christopher Scussel continues to revamp the EXPLOR engine I endeavor to understand its capabilities as an aesthetic tool.\n\nThe inherent qualities of an original EXPLOR image is it is low resolution and uses a 4 gray scale color palette. When it was used in the 1970’s images were often generated this way as a series of frames then recorded on film and manipulated in post production. In this image we use a higher resolution (250x250) and employ 3x3 “blocks” of pixels instead of alphanumeric character combinations that we can render in 24bit color. \n\nTHE EXPLOR language consists of a set of functions that manipulate the contents of an internal array. Each element in internal display memory maps into a block in the output image. The CHANJ() function places rectangular areas of blocks over previously drawn sections in internal memory and more important, it applies rules that look at the current state of a particular array element and applies a rule to change that element. The trick is how to make this visually interesting.\n\nI employ a grid structure to distribute a rectangular widget across the picture plane. The widget is a randomly defined area that grows in a random direction based on a set of random variables. During each iteration the new area overwrites internal memory (following a set  of rules). I think this variation looks and feels like Knowlton’s Example 3 and maintains the EXPLOR vibe. The rectangles interact to form dimensional depth and an architectural quality.\n\nWe continue to honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT series. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored now updated by Scussel and Kolomyjec. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history with a modern twist.\n\n(c)2022 Dr. Bill Kolomyjec and Christoper Scussel. All rights reserved.",

The construction of a visual poem without words. Where letters and other signs evoke movement, rhythm, sound, echo and silence. The work plays with processes of construction/deconstruction of characters, with the visibility or subtlety of typographic elements.\n\n*'Poema' is part of the 'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io).\n\n----------------------------------\nEach iteration has:\n-> an alternative version in Portrait format, activated by the [p] key\n-> a meta-poem, built from the features' metadata, accessible in the browser console, activated by the [F12] key\n\n----------------------------------\nFeatures:\n-> Encruzilhada (Crossroad) = 2 possibilities\n-> 3 types of Reverberations \n-> 6 types of Luminescences \n-> 5 Color schemes\n-> 14 Palettes \n\n* The names of the palettes pay homage to poets and artists who deal with the visuality of writing in their work. 7 palettes honor women, 7 palettes honor men. Almost all from Latin America.\n\n----------control keys------------ \n[F12] access to the meta-poem on browser console \n----------------------------------\n[p] alternate format portrait/square \n[o] border on/off \n[e] save image with 2000 pixels height\n[m] save image with 4000 pixels height\n[a] save image with actual size\n----------------------------------\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n----------------------------------\nCreated with p5.js\nTested in Chrome and Firefox on both Windows and Mac OS.\n\n----------------------------------\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2024\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada\n\n----------------------------------\n*Please note: there are two reservation lists in this project:\n-> One for my supporters & anyone who has 4 or more editions from my previous projects\n-> Another one for those who have one piece from any of my projects (this list is overallocated, which means there are more people on it than available slots, so: first come, first served).\n*If you use more than one wallet, or the address on the reserve list is your vault, contact me via one of my social networks up to 12 hours before the drop.\n----------------------------------",

            "description": "A special collection for #objkt4objkt 2024\n\nTaking a very simple concept and sticking to it. Here we divide a space in Voronoi cells, extrude the defined polygons in 3D, and then rotate them along one of the polygon's sides.\nI was doing research on materials and lighting when I tried this and thought it had some generative merits, and then I heard of the event, so I decided to create a generator with it.\nAll the colors/tints come from the lights, environment and material properties, the volume themselves are always \"white\".\n\nBest enjoyed on desktop / Chrome.\n\n!!! Be sure the check the menu that you can find by clicking/tapping the BUTTON in the TOP LEFT !!!\nIn this menu you'll find some options to customize and experience the artwork, as well as the exports menu.\n\n!!! TO EXPORT CLEAN HIGH RESOLUTION CAPTURES, click the \"EXPORTS\" button in the menu, select your desired resolution then click the \"START CAPTURE\" button. This only works when the generator is running in its own window, so be sure to click the \"OPEN\" button.\n\n2024 - Christophe Ulu Choffel\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0\nSee LICENSE.txt for full details",

Este proyecto se aloja en la plataforma fx(hash) y genera obras de arte únicas utilizando un algoritmo y un sistema numérico hexadecimal que se crea con cada nuevo token.\n\nEste proyecto fue desarrollado utilizando la librería p5.js de JavaScript, creada por Lauren Lee McCarthy. Reflejos es el resultado de la interacción entre la percepción humana y un conjunto de reglas interpretadas por la máquina.\n\nInspirado por la experiencia de caminar junto al mar y los estados de calma y contemplación que esta actividad puede evocar, Reflejos busca entrelazar a los espectadores con las obras de la colección. \n\nLa intención es motivar al espectador a explorar su interior y descubrir momentos de apertura perceptiva. \n\nEl objetivo es que la obra provoque una sensación de calma y claridad en el espectador a través de una conexión íntima y personal.",

            "description": "\"A mille-feuille (French pronunciation: ​[mil fœj], \"thousand-sheets\"), also known by the names Napoleon, vanilla slice, and custard slice, is a dessert made of puff pastry layered with pastry cream. Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.\n\nTraditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry (pâte feuilletée), alternating with two layers of pastry cream (crème pâtissière). The top pastry layer is finished in various ways: sometimes it is topped with whipped cream, or it may be dusted with icing sugar, cocoa, pastry crumbs, or sliced almonds. It may also be glazed with icing or fondant alone, or in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) or other colored icing stripes, and combed to create a marbled effect.\" — Wikipedia\n\nPrints available upon request: prints@stefancontiero.com\nBest enjoyed on browsers supporting Display-P3 color gamut.\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n@stefan_contiero\n",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.
