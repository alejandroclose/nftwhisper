            "description": "# Los Osos 2422\n\nI was working on the next EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "WARNING: Read instructions so you don’t get a broken token!!\n----\n\n\nQ: Why haven’t you tried fx(params)?\nA: Pff.. Sliders?\n\n\n“Pensado a mano” explores the intersection of Generative Art and Hand Drawing. The collector, by drawing a predefined number of shapes on canvas, creates a unique hand-crafted seed that generates the final artwork. That is the only customisable param, thought by hand, which interacts with various random attributes to produce a unique composition.\n\n“…the time we spend doing and making things, the process…”\n\nAnd yet the process continues. On the background, the code generates a plottable svg.\nAn artificially extended process, from hand to screen, from screen to paper, that creates a new kind of mixed media.\n\nSigned plots will soon be claimable via Artfora (tbd price + shipping)\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1 - Draw the requested shapes and wait to see the result. You can change the Seed Nr. slider if you don't like the selected mode.\n2 - Press “C” to copy drawing to Clipboard\n3 - Copy the clipboard contents to the text-input on the fx(params) sidebar\n\n***Important. If you buy several tickets, make sure you don't mint the same Seed Nr. twice (slider)\n\npress “S” to save the PNG, press “P” to plot the SVG\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis is a high-supply token minted during a bear market.

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

            "description": "The joys of childhood are too easily forgotten. Paper Planes is a generative art collection celebrating the joy and magic of origami: from the simplest materials spring delightful forms brimming with ingenuity.\n\nIn homage to the handicraft of paper folding, we developed a collection of four pens each with a unique hand-drawn feel: Ink, Pencil, Gel and Dip. They ensure each of our ten origami birds are sketched with subtle imperfections.\n\nMany of the birds are folded from patterned paper based on three traditional Japanese patterns: Seigaiha, Kōjitsunagi and Shippō. Other birds are crafted from block coloured paper which provides pop and contrast whilst sometimes birds match their background, accentuating the hand-drawn strokes that sketched them.\n\nA range of layouts bring each mint to life. Birds can flock and fly across the page. They can be confined to a regimented grid or they can escape and embrace the chaos of the currents. Contrasting frames and borders highlight different colours within each of the 15 handcrafted palettes.\n\nIf you're feeling mischievous you can press 'C' in live view to ruffle some feathers…\n\nhttps://www.phaust.art/paper-planes\n\n----------\n\nIn live view, press 'S' to save a high resolution download or add '&size=#' to the end of the URL to render at a custom height.\n\nOriginal artwork by Phaust.

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

Some extreme sounds (frequency and amplitude) can be generated.\n\n-Supply can be halved/reduced and the price can be doubled if half supply has not been minted (every 24h aprox).\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n-a synthesizer generates the sound and this is represented visually.\n\n-the sitetizer has 3 possible modulations: FM, AM and phaser.\n\n-carrier and modulator canhave 3 different types of wave: sine, square or sawtooth.\n\n-the modulator is an LFO (or noise)\n\n-each piece consists of 8 steps.\n\n-each step has randomly generated synthesizer parameters, visualizations and duration.\n\n-after the first cycle, the parameters of each step can change with higher or lower probability randomly (fxrand).\n\n-that's why in this project there are no defined fxfeatures, since they can change in each cycle. So we get an infinite and unique sequence for each piece.\n\n",

Some extreme sounds (frequency and amplitude) can be generated.\n\n-Supply can be halved/reduced and the price can be doubled if half supply has not been minted (every 24h aprox).\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n-a synthesizer generates the sound and this is represented visually.\n\n-the sitetizer has 3 possible modulations: FM, AM and phaser.\n\n-carrier and modulator canhave 3 different types of wave: sine, square or sawtooth.\n\n-the modulator is an LFO (or noise)\n\n-each piece consists of 8 steps.\n\n-each step has randomly generated synthesizer parameters, visualizations and duration.\n\n-after the first cycle, the parameters of each step can change with higher or lower probability randomly (fxrand).\n\n-that's why in this project there are no defined fxfeatures, since they can change in each cycle. So we get an infinite and unique sequence for each piece.\n\n",

These pigments are arranged in multiple layers, each layer using a different color from one of the carefully curated color palettes. Each palette consists of three to five colors. \n\nAs the pigments are shifted by random noise, new hues and patterns emerge, creating a lovely display of color and movement.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[5] to change the resolution.\n- Press [s] to save a png file at the current resolution.\n\nThis is my first generative art project. Created with p5js.\n\n________\n\nLooks best on high-resolution screens and viewed in live mode. When displayed on a low-resolution screen, an unintended moiré pattern may appear.",
