Inspired by childhood memories that passed through the watercolor sketches of my mother, who was an artist, the piece reflects my admiration for her work and her influence on my own artistic endeavors. \nIntricate forms contrast with the strict forms of cells. All these are echoes from childhood - watercolor lines of a child not bothered by a special artistic idea but trying at least to a fraction of mastering the fine arts and cubes reminiscent of ones which children use to build towers.\nOverall, the piece is a tribute to the joy and creativity of childhood, and to the power of artistic inspiration that can be passed down from one generation to the next.\n\nMade with p5js and a few GLSL shaders.

For this reason this profile is not, and should never be verified by fx(hash) and collectors should pay extra caution when collecting from it.\n\nYours, CCDDBB\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\nPowered by p5 and chroma.\n\n----------------------------------------------\nTheWallet original post: https://typed.art/967\n----------------------------------------------\n\n",

            "description": "This project draws inspiration from the dynamic and exploratory ethos of Hic Et Nunc's early days, when artists were venturing into the possibilities of NFTs and pushing creative boundaries.\n\nThe color palettes were inadvertently provided by some talented artists who had originally intended them for another project, which was ultimately completed but never published.\nHarvey McFly is to blame for the leak.\n\nThe color palettes have been paired together, creating an unexpected chromatic collaboration between the artists.\n\nI have chosen to mint this project from TheWallet, as it represents one of the most intriguing experiments ever conducted on a blockchain.\n\nThis is the inaugural work to be published on fx(hash) through TheWallet, and I hope that other artists will follow suit and engage in this playful and nonsensical practice in the future.\n\nA special thanks goes out to @TheWalletNft, who suggested the idea of minting on fx(hash) and handled the profile setup on the site.\n\nThe open and collaborative nature of TheWallet allows anyone with the seed phrase to modify the sale and to publish any kind of content from TheWallet. For this reason this profile is not, and should never be verified by fx(hash) and collectors should pay extra caution when collecting from it.\n\nYours, CCDDBB\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\nPowered by p5 and chroma.\n\n----------------------------------------------\nTheWallet original post: https://typed.art/967\n----------------------------------------------\n\n",

            "description": "-Satellites-\n\nThe Space Probe project was humanity's bold endeavor to explore the universe beyond our own solar system. At the height of the space race between the years 2400 and 2500, hundreds of probe satellites were sent out into the unknown, each with a unique mission to collect data on distant galactic objects and search for signs of life and habitable planets.\nAs the probes ventured to the edge of the solar system and beyond, they extended humanity's reach and understanding of the universe. Many of these probes were equipped with the ability to communicate their findings back to Earth, allowing us to delve deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos.\nThe probes took many forms, including galactic probes, communication satellites, and planetary probes designed for sample return. As they floated in the vast wasteland that surrounds the Milky Way galaxy, these probes searched for organic molecules, the building blocks of life, and conducted their missions with determination.\nAlthough some of the probes have since become redundant, they continue to float through the void, reminders of humanity's unending quest for knowledge and discovery in the universe. The Space Probe project was a landmark achievement, pushing the boundaries of human understanding and paving the way for further exploration of the cosmos.\n\nX to toggle the Animation (on/off)\nR to reset\n\nBuild with WebGL\nGert-Jan Akerboom - 2023\n\n(20% of primary sales will go to girlswhocode.com)\n",

This is more of a conceptual art series and I'm interested in how easy it is for an artist to lie about their work with labels, captions, and explanations in this series. I claim that it contains pornography, but it could only be pretty little bunny pictures or it could be real pornography, or both. None of it matters, ultimately, because I aim to create confusion when you look at the work.\n\nIf none of this is for you, you'll still hang the art on your wall that brings porn to mind when you look at it. After all, you, you, you, me, you, you, maybe not you, but probably you, they, we, all of us love it, and our walls deserve to have this lovely part of our lives without judgement.",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines II. Enfantillages Pittoresques” is the second of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Enfantillages Pittoresques” experiments with predefined plots, colour blending, webgl shaders, and generative music; all with a fresh, childish style. This algorithm has been trained to draw basic shapes in accordance to Satie’s lyrics. However, it uses them in unusual ways and creates what looks like fantastic creatures, microscopic beings, or, to follow Corneille, Constant, and Appel: \"human animals\".\n\n“It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child” Attributed to Picasso (falsely, probably)\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines” are best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, these have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\nPress M or Double Tap (mobile) for AUDIO mode\nWait for SILENT mode\nPress I for Trait Info (desktop)\nPress 1 for Canvas Save (desktop)\n\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=171” after URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=X” for HQ renders (standard is 2, and 8 produces 400ppi 40x44cm prints).\n\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been compressed and minified for a performance boost, but can be read fully in GitHub: https://github.com/ratchitect/\n\n\n# PERFORMANCE\nBetter experienced with Chrome.",

            "description": "A generative set of imaginary landscapes.\n\nTerrains continues a study of topographic media translations that began with Plastic Landscapes (2016) and our Field Guide to Martian Landscapes (2017). While the Field Guide focused on analyzing topographies of another planet, interpreted through telescopic imaging and software translation, this project focuses on the procedural generation of nonexistent landscapes. These landscapes are generated through a complex manipulation of perlin noise, a recurring algorithm used in videogames, film VFX, and generative art since the 1980s that resembles natural geological formations. By no means new, this tradition is part of a lineage of digital visualization projects focused on reproducing nature through algorithmic means. Our algorithm generates sequential bands of noise mapped on an X-Y plane, rendered in an oblique architectural projection, a techniques that comes from technical drawing conventions. This perspective produces a layering effect that flattens the terrain in an architectural way. Neither realistic nor completely abstract, the system plays with projection, entropy, and constraints to produce a collection of imaginary terrains sited on the Tezos blockchain.\n\nWe must also credit all who have explored this field of work: Ken Perlin, James M. Bardeen, Stephen Schmitt, Paul Bourke, Joseph Claghorn, Amit Patel, Inigo Quilez, Matt DesLauriers, and many many more...\n\nPress \"s\" to download PNG.\nPress \"r\" to redraw and shift stripes.\n\nBuilt with p5.js\nBy office ca\n2023",
