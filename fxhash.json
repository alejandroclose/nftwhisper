            "description": "Ersbla is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, London 2022. \n\nIt is the third entry in a series of abstract generative experiments inspired by the graphic and textile work of Anni and Josef Albers. As a follow-up to the 'Sabler' and 'Lebras' collections, 'Ersbla' produces textile effects using a combination of thousands of tiny dots arranged on variable grids, resulting in a wide variety of unique Bauhaus-inspired compositions in a variety of palettes.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high-resolution 2400 x 3396 px image in PNG format.\n\nDepending on the density of your output, please allow up to a few seconds for your edition to generate.",
