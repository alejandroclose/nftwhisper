            "description": "平衡 (heikō): Equilibrium\n\nAs someone with ADHD, focusing has always been a challenge for me. It's difficult for me to concentrate, especially when it comes to learning new things like p5.js. Despite the difficulty, I pushed through and managed to grasp the concepts, which was a significant accomplishment for me. To commemorate this personal milestone, I chose to incorporate the theme of focus into my first generative art token.\n\nDrawing inspiration from my childhood hobbies, I decided to represent the concept of focus by stacking stones on top of each other. As a child, I found joy in this activity, and it served as a metaphor for the determination and concentration required to overcome challenges.\n\nIn addition to my personal connection, I also drew inspiration from the Japanese culture of zen, concentration, and focus. The overall theme of my generative art token reflects these principles, paying homage to the mindset of finding inner peace and clarity through focus and concentration.\n\nBy combining my personal journey with the symbolism of stacked stones and the Japanese culture of zen, I hope to convey the importance of focus and celebrate the achievement of overcoming obstacles, especially for individuals like myself who face unique challenges in maintaining concentration.\n\nPlease press ‘2’ to ‘7’ to change the resolution (max 5600 × 7000 px).\nUse the key ’S’ to save the output as a PNG file.

            "description": "Title: Urban trajectories\n\nit's a generative work that combines the precision and rigidity of a technical project with the expressiveness and creativity of informal abstract art. Made on graph paper highlighting the technical nature of the basic design. The grid creates mathematical order and clear structure, providing a stable foundation for artistic exploration.\n\nWithin some of the squares, the shapes intertwine and overlap, giving life to the geometric vision. Triangles stand out in different directions, some dotted with circles of various diameters, while rectangles of different sizes make up intriguing compositions. The colors used are black/white and a random colour, which catch the eye and create a lively contrast.\n\nthe work challenges the viewer to perceive art even in fields usually related to mathematics and engineering. The work invites reflection on the nature of order and creativity, showing how structure and artistic freedom can coexist in harmony. the work celebrates the beauty of geometric shapes and their versatility, demonstrating that even a technical foundation can be the starting point for a unique aesthetic experience.\n\n100% code - p5.js\n\nPress left mouse button to choose density from 1 to 15 (9000x12000) (wrong results set to 1)\n\nKenzo da barra",

In my opinion, the dynamics of the lines we see in these works are very subtle, the style, the color, and the weight of each line can affect the overall picture of perception. \n\nSince 2018, I've been collecting drawings on Pinterest just for fun. I especially like the selections with spaceships, maps, robots, and boards(chip) because there are so many fine details. \n\nIn my piece called \"Symphony. Dispolarization\" I want to convey a harmonious, or relatively balanced chaos in space, just like our life from day to day we are used to what happens around us one hour, day or week can pass in an instant, based on this I show that next to one particle the world moves with unimaginable dynamics as in a symphony of great composers or, every particle, line, object, has its own rhythm.

            "description": "We are filling our one and only world with our endless cities, roads and structures, for as far as the eye can see. We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it. Thank you very much for collecting and for your continuous support.\n\n10% of primary and secondary sales will go to fxhash team; thank you for what you are doing.\n\nSelf reserved pieces are for promised gifts to my collectors.\n\nPress S to save as PNG.

That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",

            "description": "Sol is a companion project that complements my recent series, Metamorphosis. Both projects share a common foundation - a cellular automata engine. The state of each cell in a new generation is influenced by its own state as well as those of its neighboring cells from the last generation. The rules guiding these state transitions, however, are dynamic.\n\nSol for me is an experimental plotter project. As a gesture of my gratitude to minters of Metamorphosis, all minters will be on the reserve list for a free piece of Sol. I’ll take a snapshot of Metamorphosis for the reserve list 30 minutes prior to Sol’s launch. For three days (unless all reserve-holders mint sooner), Sol will be only for those on the reserve list and I'll add anyone who purchases Metamorphosis on primary subsequently. After this period, any remaining pieces, along with an additional 50 mints, will be available for public sale.\n\nA Note on the Name: The inspiration behind the name 'Sol' springs from my visits to SF MoMA, where I always find myself in the space dedicated to Sol LeWitt. Through the repetition and variation of a singular concept, LeWitt constructed forms that were striking, often evolving from basic geometric forms into intricate structures. The same is also echoed in the principle of emergence in cellular automata, where complex systems arise from the interactions of simple components governed by rules. This series, Sol, is a homage to LeWitt's ingenuity in favoring dispassionate geometric forms over the emotionally-infused abstract art styles.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

Running an optimization tool can help decrease the plotting time.\n\nPixel Love!\n",

It's difficult for me to concentrate, especially when it comes to learning new things like p5.js. Despite the difficulty, I pushed through and managed to grasp the concepts, which was a significant accomplishment for me. To commemorate this personal milestone, I chose to incorporate the theme of focus into my first generative art token.\n\nDrawing inspiration from my childhood hobbies, I decided to represent the concept of focus by stacking stones on top of each other. As a child, I found joy in this activity, and it served as a metaphor for the determination and concentration required to overcome challenges.\n\nIn addition to my personal connection, I also drew inspiration from the Japanese culture of zen, concentration, and focus. The overall theme of my generative art token reflects these principles, paying homage to the mindset of finding inner peace and clarity through focus and concentration.\n\nBy combining my personal journey with the symbolism of stacked stones and the Japanese culture of zen, I hope to convey the importance of focus and celebrate the achievement of overcoming obstacles, especially for individuals like myself who face unique challenges in maintaining concentration.\n\nPlease press ‘2’ to ‘7’ to change the resolution (max 5600 × 7000 px).\nUse the key ’S’ to save the output as a PNG file.

            "description": "### OVERVIEW ###\nThis project revisits some of the foundational ideas in my previous work \"Above (The Infinite)\" and makes them available in a parameterized form for your exploration.\n\nThis project both rewards and requires exploration. I intentionally left the parameter space very broad so that edge case configurations would be possible. In practice this means that additional curation beyond the initial random parameters will very likely be required, in a way that mimics my day to day experience as a generative artist.\n\nThanks to Karsten Schmidt for his excellent thi.ng libraries (https://thi.ng/), which form the technical foundation upon which this work was built.\n\n### CONTROLS ###\ne - Save the current frame as a PNG\nspace - Pause/Resume animation\n\n### PARAMETERS ###\nNOTE: Some combinations of parameters will cause flashing/strobing, which is why I have attached the \"Epileptic Seizure\" label to the project.\n\n* Color Palette: The color palette to apply to the output.\n* Merge Technique: The method used to combine the different patterns.\n* Patterns: The various patterns that can be combined to form the overall resulting tiled pattern.\n* Pattern Scales: The scales used to combine patterns. Higher scale values provide more visible pattern repetition.\n* Deformers: An optional additional spatial deformation of a pattern.\n* Deformer Scales: The scale of the deformation itself. Lower values use less of the deformation space, while higher values include more.\n* Detail: Acts as a filter on the visual complexity of the overall tiled pattern. Lower values will reduce visual complexity, while higher values will increase it.\n* Rotation Rate/Scroll Rates: How fast should the image rotate or scroll. Note: adjusting these parameters may result in visuals that trigger motion sickness.\n* Zoom: Lower values zoom in, higher values zoom out.\n* Round Scales Up?: When checked the pattern scales are rounded up to the nearest integer.\n* Animate?: Should some parameters be adjusted with the passing of time?\n* Low Res?: When checked, force device pixel density to 1, which reduces strain on the GPU, but may result in graphical artifacts. I usually keep this unchecked unless I want to lighten the load on the GPU.\n* Anti-alias?: When checked each pixel will be sampled multiple times to attempt to smooth out possible aliasing. This will put more load on the GPU, and will typically be slower. Can be useful when \"Low Res?\" is enabled.\n\n### HOWTO ###\nHere's how I find interesting things.\n\nFirst, I lock all of the parameters below \"Pattern 3\" at their default values. I will also usually lock both Deformers to \"Empty\", as they can sometimes hide interesting patterns while exploring, and then I experiment with enabling one or both once I have found something interesting.\n\nYou can also explore the options individually (to a certain degree) by setting other patterns to \"Empty\". This can make how patterns affect one another more obvious when you set them.\n\nAt this point I'll randomize the parameters, and then do one of the following:\n\n- If I see something that's extremely noisy/detailed, I'll turn down the \"Detail\" level, which can sometimes smooth things out.\n\n- If a tiling is very tight, I'll lower the \"Zoom\" to see more of the pattern, or the reverse if I want to see more overview.\n\n- If there's still a lot of aliasing/noise in the image, sometimes enabling anti-aliasing will help, but that will affect performance. I usually try to adjust the Scale/Detail/Zoom before resorting to anti-aliasing.\n\n- Interesting patterns are formed by the scale factors controlling how pattern overlap happens. Sometimes enabling \"Round Scales Up?\" will introduce some appealing visual symmetry.\n\n- Enable one or both of the deformers to see what impact they have on the pattern.\n\nFinally, once I've found a pattern that's interesting, I may enable scrolling or rotation. Note that enabling additional movement can increase graphical aliasing, so anti-aliasing may be required depending on the pattern.\n\nI hope you enjoy the exploration process!\n\n- Jeff Palmer\n",
