            "description": "🔥 BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY \"open edition\" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",

One of its most fascinating features are the numerous constellations that direct our gaze to the night sky and stimulate our imagination. These constellations are more than just beautiful arrangements of luminous points in the sky; they symbolize our relationship with the universe and the forces that shape it.\n\nThe constellations we see in the night sky are the result of billions of years of cosmic evolution. They tell us the story of the universe, from the formation of the first stars to the formation of galaxies and comets. These constellations remind us that we are part of a larger cosmic story and that our fate is tied to the fate of the universe.\n\nWhen we look closely at the constellations, we realize that they are constantly changing and evolving. New stars are born, old stars pass away, and galaxies move through space. This constant change reminds us that the universe is not a static entity, but a dynamic and constantly evolving system.\n\nThe uniqueness of the universe is evident not only in its size and complexity, but also in its ability to give rise to and support life. The night sky shows us not only the beauty of the universe, but also the wonders hidden within it. We are not only observers of the universe, but also part of it, and it is our responsibility to protect and preserve it.\n\nThe universe is infinite, but its infinity is not just a mathematical fact. It is a source of inspiration that encourages us to rise above our limited human experiences and explore the mysteries of the universe. We will never know everything about the universe, but we can always venture further into this infinite expanse and expand our knowledge and imagination.\n\nOverall, the universe is a fascinating and beautiful entity that never fails to captivate us. The constellations are a reminder that we are part of this beauty and complexity, and that we play an important role in exploring and preserving this universe. By getting excited about the constellations and the universe, we can spark our curiosity and expand our understanding of the world around us.\n\n[s] save\n[p] save high resolution",

One of its most fascinating features are the numerous constellations that direct our gaze to the night sky and stimulate our imagination. These constellations are more than just beautiful arrangements of luminous points in the sky; they symbolize our relationship with the universe and the forces that shape it.\n\nThe constellations we see in the night sky are the result of billions of years of cosmic evolution. They tell us the story of the universe, from the formation of the first stars to the formation of galaxies and comets. These constellations remind us that we are part of a larger cosmic story and that our fate is tied to the fate of the universe.\n\nWhen we look closely at the constellations, we realize that they are constantly changing and evolving. New stars are born, old stars pass away, and galaxies move through space. This constant change reminds us that the universe is not a static entity, but a dynamic and constantly evolving system.\n\nThe uniqueness of the universe is evident not only in its size and complexity, but also in its ability to give rise to and support life. The night sky shows us not only the beauty of the universe, but also the wonders hidden within it. We are not only observers of the universe, but also part of it, and it is our responsibility to protect and preserve it.\n\nThe universe is infinite, but its infinity is not just a mathematical fact.

One of its most fascinating features are the numerous constellations that direct our gaze to the night sky and stimulate our imagination. These constellations are more than just beautiful arrangements of luminous points in the sky; they symbolize our relationship with the universe and the forces that shape it.\n\nThe constellations we see in the night sky are the result of billions of years of cosmic evolution. They tell us the story of the universe, from the formation of the first stars to the formation of galaxies and comets. These constellations remind us that we are part of a larger cosmic story and that our fate is tied to the fate of the universe.\n\nWhen we look closely at the constellations, we realize that they are constantly changing and evolving. New stars are born, old stars pass away, and galaxies move through space. This constant change reminds us that the universe is not a static entity, but a dynamic and constantly evolving system.\n\nThe uniqueness of the universe is evident not only in its size and complexity, but also in its ability to give rise to and support life. The night sky shows us not only the beauty of the universe, but also the wonders hidden within it. We are not only observers of the universe, but also part of it, and it is our responsibility to protect and preserve it.\n\nThe universe is infinite, but its infinity is not just a mathematical fact. It is a source of inspiration that encourages us to rise above our limited human experiences and explore the mysteries of the universe. We will never know everything about the universe, but we can always venture further into this infinite expanse and expand our knowledge and imagination.\n\nOverall, the universe is a fascinating and beautiful entity that never fails to captivate us. The constellations are a reminder that we are part of this beauty and complexity, and that we play an important role in exploring and preserving this universe.

            "description": "A collaboration between leading British high-end audio brand KEF, generative artist hieroglyphica, and creative studio Parameta, Absorbed embodies the process of noise becoming high-fidelity sound through KEF’s Metamaterial Absorption Technology (MAT™). \n\nMAT™ makes the KEF sound what it is: absorbing unwanted distortion to deliver pure, accurate sound exactly as the artist intended. Inspired by this intricacy, Absorbed illustrates pseudorandom networks of patterns, slowly emerging and transforming into the maze-like form of MAT™. Clarity is revealed, noise is absorbed – high-fidelity is found.\n\nThe noise fields used in Absorbed are of two distinct types: conventional gradient noise and “sinusoidal” noise, an original algorithm developed for this series. The use of animation as artistic medium reflects the artists’ belief that no single frame can capture the full range of complexity found in the tension between sound and noise, and lets collectors observe for themselves this ever-shifting dialogue. A more extensive discussion of the algorithms used in Absorbed can be found in hieroglyphica’s companion article on fx(text).\n\n- spacebar will pause and resume the animation\n- s will save a still image of the current frame\n- technically minded collectors can consult the index.html file for info on how to render and save high-resolution images\n- use of hardware acceleration in Chrome may impact performance\n\nFounded by BBC engineer Raymond Cooke in 1961, KEF is a leading British innovator of high-end audio products including HiFi speakers, subwoofers, architectural speakers, wireless speaker-systems, and headphones.

            "description": "Field Sketch\n\nThis is a 100% generative abstract project. I'm experimenting again with sketchy rough drawing and trying to create something that looks like it could have been created by hand. There are seven composition types that produce different styles of output.\n\nThis project uses the fx(params) WYSIWYG functionality so the minter will get exactly the output they configure.\n\nExplanation of Numeric Params (all have range 0-100):\n\nXBounds - low values have primary structures near the middle of the horizontal axis\n\nYBounds - low values have primary structures near the middle of the vertical axis. For Quantized composition types this also affects the vertical level of the vanishing points.\n\nStructureSmooth - low values have a more complex global structure\n\nDetailSmooth - low values have a more complex fine structure\n\nSegmentLength - low values have more but shorter lines drawn\n\nAngleVariation - low values have more coherent line direction\n\nColorNoise - the higher the value the more random color variation for each line segment\n\nOrder - low values have the lines follow the flow fields in a more chaotic fashion\n\nBlur - higher values will use blur on top and bottom of output to simulate depth of field\n\nSymmetry - The possible values are no symmetry, 3, 4, 6, or 12. Any symmetry will be imperfect - it guides the construction of the composition but other random factors will usually prevent an exactly symmetrical result.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThere are some keyboard operations available.\n\nClick on the output and use these keys to affect it:\n's' - save at current resolution\n'2' - change to 2000 x 2000 resolution\n'3' - change to 3000 x 3000 resolution\n...\n'8' - change to 8000 x 8000 resolution\n\nNote that at higher resolutions there will be some minor variation in output.\n\nCopyright 2023 Jeff Clark\n--------------------------\n100% generative\n\nAll drawing and geometric code created by Jeff Clark using standard javascript and canvas 2D api. Perlin noise was used with support from perlin.js at https://codepen.io/sixsided/pen/emxxea.js\n\n",

            "description": "## PROJECT DESCRIPTION\n\nWhat is it like to be a sea turtle in the age of plastic?\n\nOur global addiction to single-use plastic is destroying our marine environment. Over 11 million metric tons of waste plastic enter our oceans every year. Thankfully, there is a growing force of ocean defenders rising to combat this crisis. Activists and non-profit organizations around the world are working diligently to solve the ocean plastic problem — but they don’t have nearly enough resources to succeed. This project aims to help.\n\nTurtle Vision uses code, chaos, and regl.js to offer us a glimpse into the experience of a sea turtle in 2023, struggling to survive in an ailing ocean. Turtles prey heavily on jellyfish, but have trouble distinguishing them from the countless plastic bags clogging our oceans given their similar shapes and movement patterns. Because of this, we are finding more and more sea turtles dead on beaches, having starved to death with bellies full of plastic bags.\n\nWe believe that generative art can help to reverse this trend and restore sea turtle populations to pre-plastic levels. Turtle Vision aims to raise money for 5 Gyres, one of the foremost nonprofit groups in the war on single-use plastic. 5 Gyres has a storied pedigree in this space, and has also emerged as a leader amongst conservation organizations in its embrace of blockchain technology.\n\nThis project is a collaboration between renowned generative artist @s_r_r_z, the creator of the iconic Generative Octopuses, and @Casson.tez, a professional ocean conservation activist who works at the intersection of environmentalism and web3.\n\nWe are grateful for the support of Tender.art, fx(hash), TZAPAC, the Tezos Foundation, and the entire Tezos community.\n\n\n## EDITION\n\n- Series size: 534 (it's SEA)\n- Price: 111-99-77-55-33\n- Charity share: 40% of primaries, 5% of secondaries\n\n\n## TECHNICALS\n\nVisuals:\nThis artwork portrays jellyfish intermixed with litter in the ocean, such as plastic bags and masks. The outputs offer variance in color, species, clarity, ratio, motion pattern, framing, and additional variables.\n\nSpecies:\n- Moon Jellyfish (Aurelia aurita)\n- Crystal Jellyfish (Aequorea victoria)\n- Sea Nettle (Chrysaora quinquecirrha)\n- Spotted Jellyfish (Phyllorhiza punctata)\n- Flower Hat (Olindias formosa)\n- Pink Meanie (Drymonema larsoni)\n\nScenes:\n- “Do You Feel Lucky?” (1 jellyfish + 1 bag)\n- “Unwrap Before Eating” (1 jellyfish + 1 bag)\n- “It’s In Here Somewhere” (1 jellyfish + n bags)\n- “Two Bites Left” (2 jellyfish + n bags)\n- “Fugu” (n jellyfish + 1 bag)\n- “Omakase” (n jellyfish + n bags)\n- “Feast” (no trash)\n- “Famine” (trash only)\n\nControls:\n- Drag to rotate\n- Hold alt + Drag to pan\n- Scroll to zoom\n- Press the spacebar to pause/play (in\n- Press R to toggle auto-rotation\n- Press S to take a screenshot\n- Hold the up/down arrow to adjust visibility\n\nThe work was made with JavaScript by s_r_r_z_, except for the following:\n- regl (MIT License)\n- glsl-random by mattdesl (BSD-3-Clause)\n- glsl-lut by mattdesl (MIT license)\n- glsl-noise by hughsk (MIT license)\n- glsl-fbm by yiwen lin (MIT license)\n- glsl-rotate (MIT license)\n- simplex-noise (MIT license)\n- alea (MIT license)\n- hsv2rgb (MIT license)\n- canvas-orbit-camera by hughsk (MIT license)\n- hueShiftYIQ by MISAKI NAKANO (public domain)\n- waterCaustics function adapted from jaybird (public domain)\n- Compiled using fxhash-boilerplate-webpack by fxhash (MIT License).\n\n2023.

They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "Graphic compositions made with simple elements. Playing with the subtlety and rhythm of colors, shapes and textures.\n\nThis work was inspired by the textures of monotype prints and those of metal engraving. Especially in the geometric marks made by the inking roller while stretching the graphic ink to make a manual printing. It is a tribute to the visuality of handmade prints.\n\n\"Monotipia\" means monotype printing in Portuguese. It is a graphic printing process that results in a single copy. Here I make a parallel between monotype printing and the code+hash minting process, which also produces a single image.\n\n---\nFeatures:\n-> 15 composition schemes\n-> 51 handpicked base colors\n-> 3 canvas formats:  \n-----> Portrait (vertical) \n-----> Square \n-----> Landscape (horizontal)\n-> 3 element tones options: \n-----> Light Texture & Shapes\n-----> Light Texture / Dark Shapes \n-----> Dark Texture & Shapes\n\n---\nTo save the image as a png file, type:\n[1] save at actual size \n[2] save with 2000px height\n[3] save with 3000px height\n[4] save with 4000px height\n[5] save with 5000px height\n\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n---\nCreated with p5.js\n\n---\nThis is my first project on FX(hash) and I would like to express my special thanks to Janaina Selva, Dmarchi, Gyo and Morbeck for their support and for following the step-by-step development of this work, always contributing with a critical eye and great suggestions. I also thank the help from the FX(hash) community on Discord.\n\n---\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2023\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada",
