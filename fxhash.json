            "description": "An ancient civilization had conquered the stars, building huge monoliths to harness their energy. These mega structures now lie in decay, as their lights begin to dim. What happened to these civilizations? We may never know. We can only bear witness to their ends.\n\nThe code for \"Dying of the Lights\" explores the effect of heredity on structure and color. The base data structure is a quadtree in which child nodes inherit properties from its parent. The evolution of each node depends on the structure of the paren, and not all nodes will survive. The structure is then exploded into their final resting place as they slowly orbit the star.\n\nThe piece can be animated by hitting \"Space\" to slowly watch the Dying of the Light. Performance of the animation depends on the complexity of each piece, and the technical specifications of the device.\n\nThe viewer can also control the frame depth and color of the final display, as well as show / hide several additional easter eggs in the details.\n\nControls:\n[UP / DOWN] - Adjust frame depth\n[LEFT / RIGHT] - Adjust frame color\n[D] - Show / hide details\n[SPACE] - Animate\n\n*Higher resolution images can be generated by adding &x=[width]&y=[height] behind the url. Larger images may not be rendered well on devices with less memory.\n\nCommon sizes at 300dpi: \nA4 = 2490 x 3510\nLetter = 2550 x 3300\n\nLICENSE: \nThis code is licensed under CC-BY-SA-NC 3.0 \n\nNOTICE:\nThis code makes use of the XORSHIFT prng algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift)\nIt also uses the Roboto Slab font from Google fonts (Apache 2.0: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\nAlso, much thanks to thecodingtrain for their quadtree tutorial\n",

            "description": "\n\n\nDigitally crafted flowers in pots for virtual window sills.\n\nIn the spirit of the piranha plant from the Mario Bros videogame. We wanted to create a project that acknowledges the playful depiction of nature in early videogames by creating a retro futuristic collectible that explores aesthetics over gameplay, whilst preserving the playful energy of these early digital worlds. There are many game elements that have emerged over the years that have become iconic in their own right. Their memorable designs have come to represent the exciting feeling of when we first discovered these worlds, but over time an appreciation for their simple design execution, harmony and balance has emerged. Art can exist in many forms and places including a digital pot plant.\n\nRarity:\n\nThere are a total of 23 hand-drawn and animated sprites divided into 4 groups Firelillies, Flytraps, Quasars and Stargazers and there are 15 possible combinations made from these 4 groups. 18% of the collection is a combination of these 4 groups which we can call random and the remaining 72% is divided between the remaining 14 combinations.\n\n\nThere are 3 possible grid systems 1x1, 3x3 and 4x4 \n\n3% 1x1\n\n40% 3x3\n\n57% 4x4\n\n\n\nThere are 14 possible placement points for all grids and 76 stem/sprite arragement in total\n\n\n\nFor the pots and stems there are 11 colors to choose and  no rarities for color combinations.\n\n\n\nThe flower distribution can be either symmetric or random. 35% symmetric and 65% random\n\n\n\nExport options:\n\nPressing 's' on desktop or holding for 2 seconds will download gif to whatever the current device resolution is. To export at a different resolution open the token in new window by clicking 'open' link under the token image and add \"&exportsize=1080\" or \"&exportsize=2160\" to end of the url and hit enter then either hold for 2 seconds or press 's' to create gif and download.\n\n\n\n ",

            "description": "This project is the culmination of many generative art experiments I have run throughout 2022. It relies heavily on the random walks through color and space techniques I have been working with, but also introduces other elements related to 2D and 3D rotation, framing and grains.\n\nContinuum began as an abstract composition made up of a set of interacting elements against a background. This is still true. However, in my own mind, I have come to consider many Continuum pieces as peculiar, stylized observations of massive futuristic spacial, or quantum, constructions. Maybe even involving a wormhole through the fabric of space-time for some civilization well past 1 on the Kardashev scale. At the center is an erratic crystalline form, which is fed by power trains, and all around is a massive multicolored rotating containment structure.\n\nAside from the standard, inverse, threshold and washed types, the most defining trait of each composition is the “Back Style” which relates to a point of construction, activity or deconstruction of these structures. This is further refined by the panel style, the panel density and the rotation level. The other traits largely relate to color variability and aesthetics. \n\nThis work has been coded using p5.js, and half of all royalties from the primary, and secondary, sales are assigned to the processing foundation.\n\nPress s to download a 2400x2400 pixel image.\n\nThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.\n",

            "description": "\n\n\nDigitally crafted flowers in pots for virtual window sills.\n\nIn the spirit of the piranha plant from the Mario Bros videogame. We wanted to create a project that acknowledges the playful depiction of nature in early videogames by creating a retro futuristic collectible that explores aesthetics over gameplay, whilst preserving the playful energy of these early digital worlds. There are many game elements that have emerged over the years that have become iconic in their own right. Their memorable designs have come to represent the exciting feeling of when we first discovered these worlds, but over time an appreciation for their simple design execution, harmony and balance has emerged. Art can exist in many forms and places including a digital pot plant.\n\nRarity:\n\nThere are a total of 23 hand-drawn and animated sprites divided into 4 groups Firelillies, Flytraps, Quasars and Stargazers and there are 15 possible combinations made from these 4 groups. 18% of the collection is a combination of these 4 groups which we can call random and the remaining 72% is divided between the remaining 14 combinations.\n\n\nThere are 3 possible grid systems 1x1, 3x3 and 4x4 \n\n3% 1x1\n\n40% 3x3\n\n57% 4x4\n\n\n\nThere are 14 possible placement points for all grids and 76 stem/sprite arragement in total\n\n\n\nFor the pots and stems there are 11 colors to choose and  no rarities for color combinations.\n\n\n\nThe flower distribution can be either symmetric or random. 35% symmetric and 65% random\n\n\n\nExport options:\n\nPressing 's' on desktop or holding for 2 seconds will download gif to whatever the current device resolution is. To export at a different resolution open the token in new window by clicking 'open' link under the token image and add \"&exportsize=1080\" or \"&exportsize=2160\" to end of the url and hit enter then either hold for 2 seconds or press 's' to create gif and download.\n\n\n\n ",

            "description": "\"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a magical kingdom known for its beautiful landscapes and mystical creatures. The kingdom was ruled by a kind and fair queen, who loved nothing more than to spend her days exploring the vast and varied terrain of her realm.\n\nOne day, the queen was wandering through a particularly cold and snowy region of the kingdom when she came upon a strange sight. Instead of snow, the ground was covered with soft, fluffy balls of wool, as if the earth itself had been transformed into a giant ball of yarn.\n\nThe queen was fascinated by this curious phenomenon, and she decided to follow the trail of wool to see where it led. After walking for some time, she came upon a beautiful lake, the surface of which was frozen solid. But instead of ice, the lake was made entirely of woolen fibers, swirling and twirling in the gentle breeze.\n\nThe queen marveled at the sight, and she couldn't help but reach out and touch the soft, velvety surface of the woolen lake. As she did, she felt a warmth and comfort wash over her, as if the wool were alive and pulsing with energy.\n\nOver the years, the queen visited the woolen lake often, always feeling a sense of peace and contentment when she was near it. And as the years went by, the people of the kingdom began to flock to the woolen lake, seeking the same sense of warmth and comfort that the queen had found.\n\nThe woolen lake became a beloved and sacred place in the kingdom, and it was known throughout the land as the \"mar de lã\" - the sea of wool. And so it remained, a magical and mystical place that brought joy and happiness to all who visited.\"\n_AI GPT\n\nMade with <3 and p5.js",
