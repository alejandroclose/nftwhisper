            "description": "INSPIRATION\n\nSpirali was inspired by Tyler Hobbs' work with flow fields. However, instead of selecting random starting points for each shape to be drawn, which is more usual in flow fields works, I wanted to constrain the starting points to certain positions so that the shape being drawn could expand freely without the risk of colliding with other shapes, that's when I got to the spiral flow field.\n\nWHY SPIRALI?\n\nThe name of this collection is not only a direct translation of spirals in Italian, but it is also related to Italian cuisine and my own personal experience in Italy. The relationship with Italian cuisine is due to the immense number of types of pasta that exist, including one called spirali. When I was a child I only knew three or four types of pasta, but when I became a bit older I was amazed to learn that there were many more. Actually, there are hundreds. Just like from the same type of basic dough, you can make hundreds of types of pasta, my idea was, from just one type of spiral flow field, to make hundreds of images. A strategy of forcing creativity by imposing a major constraint.\n\nThe name of this collection also relates to my personal experience because it was visiting Italy many years ago that I first became interested in art and design because of the beautiful buildings, churches and works of art that I came across.\n\nDESIGN STRATEGY\n\nA spirali is made up of several tails and each tail is made up of a basic element, which I called slice. A tail may have from one to thousands slices. It is mainly the variation in the number of slices and how they are colored that creates the different tail styles in each spirali.\n\nThe slices start at the center of the spiral and in each iteration they grow a certain length or split in two depending on the parameters used in the algorithm, which also determine the outline and fill of each slice when it is rendered.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe main features that a spirali can have are:\n\n- Styles: Refers to the drawing patterns of each tail, that means, the shape, fill and stroke of the slices that form the tail. There are about 16 possible styles from which the algorithm will choose about 3 for each spirali.\n\n- Zoom out: It is related to how much larger the flow field area is in comparison to the image area. There are two possibilities: 50% and 100%.\n\n- Curvature: An arbitrary measure of the rate the tails of a spirali are turning. A spirali can have high or low curvature.\n\n- Rotation: The rotation direction: clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n- Tails: The number of tails in a spirali.\n\n- Palette: The palette's name. There are about 14 possible palettes.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n\n- Press \"m\" to export a medium resolution image (2000px x 2000px);\n- Press \"h\" to export a high resolution image (6000px x 6000px);\n\nLICENSING\n\nPlease see license.txt file.\n\nTwitter: @PauloSilvaGArt\nSite: https://paulosilva.art",

            "description": "Our vision is to create meaningful generative artworks that express human sentiments about their social experiences.\n\nWe’re currently focused on experiences centered around celebration, and we’ve chosen a theme that connects people through music.\nMusic has the power to evoke a wide range of emotions within us, especially when experienced through a collective experience.\n\nWe wanted to generate an artistic script that visually captures these expressions. \n\nOur first music NFT collection reflects human sentiments towards Tomorrowland 2022. \nIt's a creative collaboration with dahleea, an artist dedicated to colors, who gave us the inspiration for the visuals you are seeing through one of her beautiful and colorful artworks.\n\nCoding, music, and art collide to recreate emotions expressed by people coming together from all over the world to share music and connection at one of the world’s leading music festivals. \n\nThe creative process:\n\nData was collected via emotion analysis using Twitter’s API. Our data is derived from emotion analysis models to extract the emotion scores (Happiness, Anger, Sadness, Fear, and Surprise) from 105,762 tweets, written in English, and containing mention of ‘Tomorrowland' between July 15, 2022, to August 8, 2022. \n\nOur analysis demonstrated the following emotions:\n\nHappiness: 38%\nAnger 8%\nSadness: 26%\nFear: 28%\n\nMusic:\n\nIn Pillars of Tomorrow, there are 4 instruments: bass, piano, percussion (hi-hat, kick, snare, claps, fx sounds), and a quiet pad. All the rhythms are self-written using Ableton, exported, and randomly selected to create the backbone of our generative music NFT.\n\nThis music piece has 4 different parts (basic, drop, break, after-drop) which are looped 3 times. All parts include different rhythm variations which are chosen randomly. \n\nThe generative harmony is present in the basic and after-drop parts. The key to generating harmony is using the emotion percentages above as possibilities for the next piano chord and melody to sound happy or sad.  \nWe chose to distort our bass sound according to anger trait values, as distortion can turn a mild bass into an aggressive one. \n\nFinally, there is also an emotion of surprise, which is associated with a special background and the sound of bells ringing.  The surprise element trait of the mints will be revealed after the Pillars of Tomorrow collection is fully minted.\n\nWe wanted to make a dynamic collection that would give you the feeling of a live music event, an interactive experience. A big stage flowing with music and diverse human expressions.\n\nc-camera start/stop\np pause (or play)\n\nspace (play/stop)\n\nl (change where the camera look)\n\nArrow Up (View pillars from above)\nArrow down (go to starting position)\nArrow left/right (camera moving direction)\n\nAWSD work as arrows as well\nscroll (Zoom In/Out)\n\nenter (screenshot)\n\nFor an optimal experience, we recommend using Google Chrome.\n\n#CodingIsArt\n\n",

In all that vastness, we are the smallest fraction of time imaginable, floating around on a speck of dust. Yet somehow, we continue to work, learn, build relationships, create, and participate in all these other odd, uniquely human practices. It’s truly fascinating, when in the grand scheme, none of it seems consequential.\n\nAmara Celestial is an artistic representation of this intergalactic madness and the love for it. To expand on the project’s identity…Amara, my wife’s name, has many meanings. In her culture and family, it means “love” or “everlasting beauty”. Celestial most commonly refers to things not of this world, but from the sky, or space. The shapes, lines, and primary design of this project represent the unpredictable nature of the universe. The entire piece is stippled with thousands of points of various palette selected colors, to resemble the uncountable number of light sources in the great sea of space, as well as to provide textural depth.\n\nThe Features:\n- Canvas Style: Pretty simple, the canvas can be square (2048 x 2048), portrait (1352 X 2048) or landscape (2048 x 1352).\n- Palettes: There are 10 different palettes, each with equal chance of being randomly chosen. The palettes were heavily influenced by my wife. She is a woman of South American descent and loves the bright colors and contrast often seen in the traditional clothing and art of her culture. There are a few muted palettes, including a mono palette to mix things up!\n- Background Color: The background color can be black, white, or blue with varying rarity.\n- Background Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the background shape (if drawn).\n- Primary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the primary shape (i.e., the foremost shape).\n- Secondary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the secondary shape.\n- Posterize: This is a color limiting filter that can cause harsher (less smooth) changes in color. The lower the number, the more abrupt the changes (2 being the lowest allowed).\n- Primary Shape Centered: This is a true/false based on whether the primary shape is centered on the canvas.\n- Background override: This will override the selected background and replace it with vertical or horizontal lines, or prevent the background shape from being drawn entirely.\n\nOther randomness factors (non-features)\n- Stroke thickness on various shapes and points of the project.\n- Size of the overall shapes, as well as the size of the inner radius of the shapes.\n- Spacing between the stippling and lines (to keep it pattern-less).\n- Positioning of all the shapes (restricted to the canvas).\n- The number of iterations (rings) for each shape.",

The species diversity and the random stack of rocks, sands, fences and other objects are main structures I want to capture, in an abstract and planar style. \n\nMoreover, in this project, I also try to explore the representation ability of generative art. I select three elements: shape of entity, layout of palette, and stack of object location. The factors behind these elements are the balance of randomness and structure: the generative art generates the variants from randomness but restricts its chaos with structure (deterministic constraints) to represent the meaningful results. \n\nVariables:\n- 4 layouts\n- 6 texture patterns\n- 15 color palette\n- 3 randomness\n- 2 completeness\n\nPlease be patient with drawing process.",

Inspired by the early pioneering work of the concrete poets such as Dom Sylvester Houédard, Ian Hamilton Finley and Steve McCaffe, the project is a play with letters, words and graphic form in the computational and generative space.\n\nEach iteration gives you the possibility to discover a variety of visual form through exploring the system. Please explore your iteration with the key interactions below. It is hoped that you give the time to explore and observe. If you don't, you may end up with just a blank canvas. \n\nThank you for collecting. \n\nKey Interactions\n\n‘a’ activates forward motion on/off\n‘b’ activates backward motion on/off\n‘r’ rotates grid 45° [ rotates on key pressed]\n‘f’ rotates the grid freely [ stops on key release ]\n‘p’ switches grid scale on/off [ this can be CPU heavy on older machines ] \n‘g’ extra glyphs on/off\n‘q’ return to the initial state \n\n\nProgram written by Mark Webster\nFont is copyright ©simonrenaud\n\nareafour.xyz\n@motiondesign_01",

            "description": "Mei(梅):\n\n\"Mei\" is an oriental art piece featuring the imagery of plum blossom, a symbol of courage and perseverance in traditional Chinese culture.\n\nThe generative system at the backend of \"Mei\" is an exploration of this cultural symbol by modern art language. The basic elements of the paintings are merely circles and enclosed flow field shapes. A great variety of short and light strokes of such elements are used across the paintings. Xuan paper is occasionally used as background, which is a painting material since the Tang dynasty.\n\nMei's outputs span different stages of plum blossom from winter to spring. The scene also changes from a calm day to snowy or even stormy weather. The consistent yet complex senses and feelings reflected are surprisingly versatile.",

In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

Still, its true nature gives the artist complete freedom from all commercially available tools/constraints.\n\nThe collection \"Modern Times\" highlights the dark ages of generative arts using a bichromatic color palette and evolves toward the contemporary \"Digital Renaissance\" era using warmer, more acid and \"pop\" colors.\n\nAbout Eko33:\nOfficial fx(hash) page: https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Eko33\nOfficial Website: https://www.eko33.com/\n",

            "description": "Cuts is an abstract representation of the exact moments in our lives when something is cut. It could be moving to a different country, being fired, quitting a bad habit, when a relationship ends or when you receive a very bad (or good!) news.\nBy themselves, cuts are not positive or negative events; it really depends on who you were before and who you wish to be after. But one thing is sure: every cut creates a new space that wasn’t there. This space could be small or huge, ordered or chaotic, regardless, you have to deal with it. Sometimes cuts try to resist and heal themselves extruding the core of the fibres we are made of, but they will fail. A cut is irreversible and it’s up to us to fill the gap with meaning.\n\nMain features include:\n- Curated palettes (21)\n- Drawing modes (3)\n- Extrusions (yes/no)\n- Orientation (3)\n- Overlapping (yes/no)\n- Covered area (2)\n- Cut position (2)\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [s] to save a 2400x2400 px image\n- Press [t] to toggle shading (sometimes flat colours rock!)\n- Press [c] to see copyright notice\n- Press [f] to log features in console\n\nBy Todemashi 2022\nNFT License 2.0\n\n### NOTES\nMade with p5js and GLSL shaders.\nShaders are based on tutorials and code by Patricio Gonzalez Vivo - The Book of Shaders - https://thebookofshaders.com/",

            "description": "The preparations for the first mission began in 2142. It had become clear that mining petroleum on Earth would soon become financially unfeasible, so looking to other planets was the only logical choice. It took seventeen more years to perfect the technology so that the first colonists could reach Proxima b within the lifetime of one generation.\n\nAfter 45 years of travelling at almost one-tenth of the speed of light, they reached their new home. It was rich in petrochemicals but scarce in the nutrients necessary for long term human survival. After merely six generations, humanity was forced to travel once again in search of a new world. The four missions that parted from the Proxima system to colonise other possibly habitable planets in the galaxy sparked a new age of human civilisation that would never see itself united and thriving again.\n\nEventually, all the colonies became independent societies as their differing interests drove them apart. Each small civilisation chose its path, wandering the void of space alone. Over time, millions of kilometres apart, each colony developed its own culture and traditions. While their habits and customs changed, some things remained the same across all the societies, like how it became a certain tradition to convert the outer world years and days to Earth time and celebrate holidays according to the calendar of the old world.\n\nThe new nomads learned from the first pilgrims. They used the technology once optimised for oil extraction to traverse other worlds, searching for sustenance. Peculiar wandering nonspaces emerged from the involuntary degrowth of human civilisation.\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "Cellular Automata are one of the oldest and simplest classes of generative systems. Beginning with the highly abstracted, reductionist models of artificial life research by Stanislav Ulam and John von Neumann in the 1940s, Barricelli in the early 1950s, then re-discovered, formalized, expanded and popularized by other mathematicians like Conway and Wolfram 20-30 years later, it's a long-running field of research, rich with unexpected surprises and new discoveries. C-SCAPE is (a partial) result of over 20 years of my own explorations and a celebration of these simple systems.\n\nMost of my purely generative work has been about creating and harnessing emergent complexity & nonrepetitve, ever-changing behaviors (and their interactions) borne from extremely simple systems, mechanisms, algorithms & languages: Exposing, investigating (and yes, celebrating) generativity in its raw form. By minimizing, though not entirely avoiding, additional human aesthetic decision making (here primarily in the form of curating automata rules & color themes), I'm trying to focus the observer on the raw beauty of the underlying processes and bring it to the fore. My hope is, this too will lead viewers asking themselves the deeper questions about the nature of rules, behavior, order and complexity in their own lives, esp. in the current rising polarizing political & anti-science climate. Furthermore, I'd like to provide a counter point and emphasize the unique qualities of generative art, compared to other, more figurative and abstract art approaches.\n\nC-SCAPE simulates a shared toroidal environment in which multiple cellular automata (CA) are evolving and influencing each other, forming short-lived symbioses and/or wiping each other out, only to be restored again later on. The automata are all operating on a single row of pixels at a time and therefore are only 1-dimensional. Yet, many of them also have a short term memory and can produce more complex structures/behaviors by utilizing their memory of previous cell states. Each individually minted version produces a unique system which evolves over time and never repeats.\n\nThe final selection of CA rules used in this piece is the result of many years of experimentation with 100,000s of different configurations and many (manual) review/pruning/cataloging sessions to encourage the minted editions to cover a interesting & balanced subset of the more than duodecillion (10^39) possible individual structures & textures (not including interactions and/or color variations)...\n\nViewing\n\nThe piece in best viewed in medium/high resolution landscape format. The horizontal resolution should be at the very least 800 pixels, preferably double that or higher. There's a max. pixel resolution limit of 4096 pixels in either direction, but CPU performance might suffer at these resolutions. On narrow/mobile portrait ratios the piece will be shown 90 degrees rotated and is scrolling sideways.\n\nControls\n\n- x : export current frame\n- r : randomize environment\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and thi.ng",
