While most of the country’s wine comes from the region of Cuyo, specifically the province of Mendoza, there is another hidden gem that is often overlooked: Entre Rios.\n\nNamed after the two massive rivers that surround it, Entre Rios is a province located in the northeast of Argentina. What many people don’t know is that it boasts a long and fascinating history of wine production that dates back to the early 19th century.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Entre Rios, I had the pleasure of exploring a small vineyard located near the Parana river. As I walked among the vines, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by their vibrant colors, intricate patterns of the leaves, and the beautiful clusters of grapes. It was clear to me that there was something truly special about the vineyards of Entre Rios.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the region’s history, I discovered that until 1937, Entre Rios was one of the largest wine producers in the country, with over 60 vineyards operating in the province. However, a national law was passed that year creating the Regulating Board of Wine, which concentrated and granted exclusivity to wine production in Cuyo. It wasn’t until 1993 that the law was repealed, allowing vineyards to be planted and modified throughout the country.\n\nToday, Entre Rios is home to a small but thriving wine industry that is known for its unique blends and varietals. One of the most notable grapes is the Tannat, which was once the predominant variety in the region.\n\nInspired by the beauty of these vineyards, I decided to create a generative art collection that celebrates the colors, shapes, and textures of the grapes and vines called ‘Lorda’.\n\n\n-----------\nAbout Lorda\n-----------\nTannat originates in southwest France (Madiran). However, it was not very admired there, so Tannat began its journey: it moved to our country, in the trunks of a Basque, Juan Jauregui, and settled in Entre Rios towards the end of the 1800s. This farmer nicknamed “El Lorda” planted Tannat in Concordia and managed to make a quite respectable wine. The grape took that nickname and became known as Lorda.\n\n\n-----\n\nPress \"e\" to save a high res png while in live mode.\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2023)\n\nMade with P5js and <3",

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

While most of the country’s wine comes from the region of Cuyo, specifically the province of Mendoza, there is another hidden gem that is often overlooked: Entre Rios.\n\nNamed after the two massive rivers that surround it, Entre Rios is a province located in the northeast of Argentina. What many people don’t know is that it boasts a long and fascinating history of wine production that dates back to the early 19th century.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Entre Rios, I had the pleasure of exploring a small vineyard located near the Parana river. As I walked among the vines, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by their vibrant colors, intricate patterns of the leaves, and the beautiful clusters of grapes. It was clear to me that there was something truly special about the vineyards of Entre Rios.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the region’s history, I discovered that until 1937, Entre Rios was one of the largest wine producers in the country, with over 60 vineyards operating in the province. However, a national law was passed that year creating the Regulating Board of Wine, which concentrated and granted exclusivity to wine production in Cuyo. It wasn’t until 1993 that the law was repealed, allowing vineyards to be planted and modified throughout the country.\n\nToday, Entre Rios is home to a small but thriving wine industry that is known for its unique blends and varietals. One of the most notable grapes is the Tannat, which was once the predominant variety in the region.\n\nInspired by the beauty of these vineyards, I decided to create a generative art collection that celebrates the colors, shapes, and textures of the grapes and vines called ‘Lorda’.\n\n\n-----------\nAbout Lorda\n-----------\nTannat originates in southwest France (Madiran). However, it was not very admired there, so Tannat began its journey: it moved to our country, in the trunks of a Basque, Juan Jauregui, and settled in Entre Rios towards the end of the 1800s. This farmer nicknamed “El Lorda” planted Tannat in Concordia and managed to make a quite respectable wine. The grape took that nickname and became known as Lorda.\n\n\n-----\n\nPress \"e\" to save a high res png while in live mode.\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2023)\n\nMade with P5js and <3",

            "description": "------------\nIntroduction\n------------\nArgentina is world-renowned for its exquisite wine, and the Malbec grape has long been a celebrated variety. While most of the country’s wine comes from the region of Cuyo, specifically the province of Mendoza, there is another hidden gem that is often overlooked: Entre Rios.\n\nNamed after the two massive rivers that surround it, Entre Rios is a province located in the northeast of Argentina. What many people don’t know is that it boasts a long and fascinating history of wine production that dates back to the early 19th century.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Entre Rios, I had the pleasure of exploring a small vineyard located near the Parana river. As I walked among the vines, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by their vibrant colors, intricate patterns of the leaves, and the beautiful clusters of grapes. It was clear to me that there was something truly special about the vineyards of Entre Rios.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the region’s history, I discovered that until 1937, Entre Rios was one of the largest wine producers in the country, with over 60 vineyards operating in the province. However, a national law was passed that year creating the Regulating Board of Wine, which concentrated and granted exclusivity to wine production in Cuyo. It wasn’t until 1993 that the law was repealed, allowing vineyards to be planted and modified throughout the country.\n\nToday, Entre Rios is home to a small but thriving wine industry that is known for its unique blends and varietals. One of the most notable grapes is the Tannat, which was once the predominant variety in the region.\n\nInspired by the beauty of these vineyards, I decided to create a generative art collection that celebrates the colors, shapes, and textures of the grapes and vines called ‘Lorda’.\n\n\n-----------\nAbout Lorda\n-----------\nTannat originates in southwest France (Madiran). However, it was not very admired there, so Tannat began its journey: it moved to our country, in the trunks of a Basque, Juan Jauregui, and settled in Entre Rios towards the end of the 1800s. This farmer nicknamed “El Lorda” planted Tannat in Concordia and managed to make a quite respectable wine. The grape took that nickname and became known as Lorda.\n\n\n-----\n\nPress \"e\" to save a high res png while in live mode.\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2023)\n\nMade with P5js and <3",

            "description": "------------\nIntroduction\n------------\nArgentina is world-renowned for its exquisite wine, and the Malbec grape has long been a celebrated variety. While most of the country’s wine comes from the region of Cuyo, specifically the province of Mendoza, there is another hidden gem that is often overlooked: Entre Rios.\n\nNamed after the two massive rivers that surround it, Entre Rios is a province located in the northeast of Argentina. What many people don’t know is that it boasts a long and fascinating history of wine production that dates back to the early 19th century.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Entre Rios, I had the pleasure of exploring a small vineyard located near the Parana river. As I walked among the vines, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by their vibrant colors, intricate patterns of the leaves, and the beautiful clusters of grapes. It was clear to me that there was something truly special about the vineyards of Entre Rios.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the region’s history, I discovered that until 1937, Entre Rios was one of the largest wine producers in the country, with over 60 vineyards operating in the province. However, a national law was passed that year creating the Regulating Board of Wine, which concentrated and granted exclusivity to wine production in Cuyo. It wasn’t until 1993 that the law was repealed, allowing vineyards to be planted and modified throughout the country.\n\nToday, Entre Rios is home to a small but thriving wine industry that is known for its unique blends and varietals. One of the most notable grapes is the Tannat, which was once the predominant variety in the region.\n\nInspired by the beauty of these vineyards, I decided to create a generative art collection that celebrates the colors, shapes, and textures of the grapes and vines called ‘Lorda’.\n\n\n-----------\nAbout Lorda\n-----------\nTannat originates in southwest France (Madiran). However, it was not very admired there, so Tannat began its journey: it moved to our country, in the trunks of a Basque, Juan Jauregui, and settled in Entre Rios towards the end of the 1800s. This farmer nicknamed “El Lorda” planted Tannat in Concordia and managed to make a quite respectable wine. The grape took that nickname and became known as Lorda.\n\n\n-----\n\nPress \"e\" to save a high res png while in live mode.\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2023)\n\nMade with P5js and <3",
