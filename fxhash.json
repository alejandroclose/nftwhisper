Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

It is characterized by simplicity and minimalism, and I focused on using clean and precise lines to convey shapes, forms, and textures. Also emphasized outlines, color palettes, and subject lines rather than shadows to create a more substantial visual impact.\nI expressed this idea through lines with simplicity and clarity to leave room for interpretation by the viewer. One of the advantages of line art is its versatility. I combined lines with geometric shapes to add depth and texture to the image. \nOverall, I tried to offer a unique way of expressing creativity by focusing on clean lines and minimal aesthetics, and I believe that lines can have an eternal charm that will continue to captivate audiences in various artistic media such as digital art.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac. In case the site crashes, close all other applications and retry. If you’re not able to render in 12K on your device, please get in touch (@pxlshrd on Social Media and Discord).\n\nPlease note:\n- The Adaptive mode has a slightly altered appearance compared to the default aspect ratio.\n\n- The code was tested on Mac Apple Silicon/Windows/iOS/iPadOS with consistent and pixel-perfect results throughout.\n\n- The live view on Android devices slightly deviates from those on the systems mentioned above.\n\n/////\n\nCreated with p5.js and GLSL shaders.",

            "description": "Our realities appear as a layering of moments, emotions, and choices that accumulate through space and time. These experiences pile up to form the foundation for everything to come, shaping our perspectives and influencing our sense of self, character, and worldview.\n\n'Pile' embraces the infinite possibilities of generative art to represent the rich, complex, and cumulative nature of life's experiences through the passage of time. Each moment builds on top of previous memories, where the present is always the sharpest, yet is soon obscured by what follows. Just as the imprint of past experiences can linger in our lives, the influences of older layers can still be seen in each piece, imbuing each composition with a depth and variety that is indicative of life's many histories. Composed of these textured and stacked layers, ‘Pile’ forms a dense and organic heap that embodies the controlled chaos of life's multitudes.\n\nResponses to our experiences tend to oscillate between thoughtfully pragmatic and mechanical means – and more sensitive, organic, and even passionate approaches. They’re a blur of exactitude and wildness, entropy and growth, a range of experiences and outcomes that vary so greatly that only by changing our perspectives and taking a step back can we see the commonality between each of our piles of life’s moments. The result is a visual representation of the cumulative nature of life's experiences, where forgotten moments and cherished memories are piled high with abandon, yet worthy of celebration.\n\nInspired by the works of artists such as Jackson Pollock and Joan Mitchell, 'Pile' invites us to contemplate the rich and multifaceted nature of life, and to celebrate the distinctive stories that each of us carries within. Through its vivid abstraction of life's controlled chaos, and the tension between organic lines and overtly digital marks, 'pile' beckons us to consider the intricacies of our own layered identities and to revel in the diversity of life.\n\ncreated in p5.js.\n\n_________________________\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press ‘p’ to save png\n- Press ‘1’ - ‘9’ to run a high resolution file (higher resolution files will take longer to load)\n",
