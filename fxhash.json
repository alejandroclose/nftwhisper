            "description": "Henge is an exploration of circular megalithic structures of the prehistoric age. It is a work of historical fiction where these stone assemblies, achieved through herculean efforts of stacking, aligning, and balancing immense chiseled rocks, are reimagined within an alternate universe of algorithmic possibility. Historically, henges share a few qualities that inspired this project. First, they are places of gathering within a loose collection of stones to organize ceremony or worship under celestial alignments. They are also monolithic in their materiality and employ the most elemental techniques of megalithic, or large stone, construction. These particular types of henges, known as cromlechs, are circular spaces fit with purpose and ritual and in this sense, serve as precedents to the great human edifices; charging landscapes with meaning and presence through geometry and order. Finally, henges are a collective language of place-making shared across a range of cultures and ages, from the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras and across territories from modern-day Morocco, Portugal, Brazil, Germany, Scandinavia, to the well-known Stonehenge in Great Britain.\n\nThis project is deeply inspired by the timeless and universal narrative created through the thoughtful and deliberate placement of large rocks in a circle. It seems that when confronted with marking a place and communing with nature, human beings like to make circles out of stones. Among all the symbols of place making, the circle is the original and still remains the most universal. Through the use of code to portray these imperfect structures, Henge animates the history of these circles in all their roughness and seemingly endless variation.\n\n\n--------\n\nCreated by Aranda\\Lasch @ArandaLasch\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\nNovember 2022\n\n[Interaction instructions]\n'left' + 'right' arrow keys to change view\n'i' saves a 2048x2048 PNG\n\n[Info]\np5.js\nHenge is optimized for Chrome, runs slowly on Firefox (the longer the wait, the more stones and/or grass are being generated)\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n10% of all primary and secondary proceeds donated directly to Girls Who Code\n",

            "description": "'Murals' is a collection of 256 abstract compositions born out of an intense period diving deeply into street art, pointillism and the inner workings of neural networks.\n\nThe work explores projection, refraction and abstraction of points as they ripple through multi-dimensional space-time. Points refract through multi-dimensional space to become shapes, which then become coordinate systems for the projections of new points that create a sense of form, texture, lighting, and material properties. \n\nThe work is also a celebration of imperfections and how a combination of many tiny – almost individually imperceptibly small – imperfect details can shape our perceptions of form, materiality, mood. This is explored within this work through subtle uses of sprays, flecks, scuffs, cuts, grain, targets (projections of projections), construction lines, base projections, occasional glitches that cause curvature, bounced light, shadows, and more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n15 colour palettes: \nScream, Night Bus, Double Backflip, Jaws, Sunday, Atom, Space, Tipex, \nGraphite, Leaf, Earth, Bubble Gum, Citrus, Jellyfish, Damp Concrete.\n\n4 times of day (that create subtle changes in light colour):\nDaylight, Winter Morning, Midnight, Sunset\n\n2 Border types: \nNormal, Thin\n\nVarious features that subtly impact appearance surface textures and shard forms:\nMetallic, Engrave, Number of Shards, Scuff Marks, Symmetry. \n\nControls:\n- Press [ S ] to save the work at its current image size as a PNG.\n- Press [ 1 ] to set the image size to 1440 x 1944 pixels (default size)\n- Press [ 2 ] to set the image size to 2880 x 3888 pixels\n- Press [ 3 ] to set the image size to 4320 x 5832 pixels\n\n- Press [ F ] to toggle freeform mode to create custom image sizes and aspect ratios\n- Press [ R ] to reload the image (for use in freeform mode)\n\nThis work has been tested on Chrome and Safari on Mac OS, and also using an Android smartphone. Please make sure that it works on your device before minting. Based on testing (in May 2022), each work should take about 5-10 seconds to fully load on a laptop or desktop machine, and 15-20 seconds on a mobile device.

Developed from scratch, it employs a system of rule-based environments that have been a source of satisfaction for me since 1995.\n\nThe program generates three invisible planets, each at a different scale - small, medium, and large. Fifty objects then randomly select a planet, a speed to orbit around it, and one of three brush sizes - small, medium, or large. These objects move around their respective planets, painting color and texture across the planetary orbit in three-dimensional space.\n\nTo reveal the blueprint of the system, press the \"s\" key on your keyboard. The hidden algorithm that governs the brushes' movement is then displayed, revealing a mesmerizing display of synchronized choreography as the brushes interconnect with each other.\n\nPress the following keys to interact :\n\n- '1': swap the background color to \"ocean\"\n- '2': swap the background color to \"mist\"\n- '3': swap the background color to \"lilac\"\n- '4': swap the background color to \"amethyst\"\n- '5': swap the background color to \"crimson\"\n- '6': swap the background color to \"emerald\"\n\n- 'l': toggle animation loop on/off\n- 's': system reveal, show the blueprint of the algorithm\n\nJoshua Davis / PrayStation 'Orbit of Influence' / (2023) real-time generative program, 1240 x 1653 px, Date Minted: April 2023\n\nTwitter: @joshuadavis\nInstagram: @praystation\nWebsite: https://joshuadavis.com\n\nBio :\n\nSince 1995, Joshua Davis is an artist, technologist, author and designer in algorithmic image making & animation.

The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature. Brought into existence via the blockchain, it is a new form of “token word poetry.”\n\n\nAs with the duo’s other poetry “unreadings,” all minters will receive an airdropped broadside of the full poem after all editions are collected. A 1/1 media-rich version of the entire poem will also be made available. \n \nPoetic traits:\n- 321 editions performed by the algorithm, out of billions of possible combinations\n- Each unique piece contains between 3 and 6 (out of 60) lines of generative text from a poem by Technelegy – a custom text generator fine-tuned on Stiles’ writing and research material, seeded with prompts from Stiles’ and Stern’s work – translated into binary and performed by Stiles\n- 24 possible binary backbeats performed by Stern in his “Nathaniel Fun Time” (NFT) stylings, and generatively re-mixed\n- 98 possible intros\n- 15 musical stems composed by Kris Bones, generating millions of possible mixes\n- Thousands of possible ending combinations \n- 5 fonts, layered in billions of potential ways, including Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer”\n- 13 color palettes based on Stern and Stiles’ respective artworka\n- Very rare attributes including music-less performance, poem-less music, repeated “B1nary 0de” (title only)\n\nClick to start and stop or replay. Although the first play through will be the same every time, starting and stopping may create minor variations in your mix (though not any of the core attributes).\n\n0RAL B1NARY: “BINARY ODE” was produced with partial support from Refraction DAO’s Creative Grants program, and premiered as part of Refraction Festival at Art Basel Miami 2022. 15% of primary sales go to Refraction, and 5% of primary sales will be donated to Black Girls Code.\n",

            "description": "Experimental generative collection that merges analog photography, AI, generative text, and algorithmic coding, by digging down into the essence and building blocks of the different artistic communication channels. \n\nThis work engages with all aforementioned mediums in a joint manner, guided by a random process. It starts with a collection of analog photographs, shot on film and scanned that were later used as a training dataset in Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training. This way, A.I. learns the main characteristics of film photography. In particular, it mimics its recognizable grain. Another type of pixel grain is added with the use of code and pixel shifting as well as digital manipulation. Finally, the last type of “grain” appears with the use of generative text where a different kind of A.I. was given a short description of the project and instructed to imagine the rest of the story. The fragmented and void of meaning parts of generative text are added to the images as one of the possible traits.",

The kernel determines the micro and macro structures that develop in the crystal. The crystals are grown from \"seed\" pixels (in this artwork, the white outline and white center pixel provide the seed).\n\nSometimes the patterns are chaotic, sometimes they are stable. If you are lucky, a pattern will be generated \"on the edge of chaos\" that mixes stability and chaos in an emergent complex system. These are rare. In addition, a small number of artworks will result in \"dead\" crystals that do not grow. These are also rare, but there is a chance that your crystal will be a mostly black square.\n\nEach piece is composed of 3 different randomly generated kernels that sweep outwards from the center.",

Recently, searching for both items in antique stores, it turned out the illustrations, although still beautiful, aren't the same as I remember them. Rabuzin's oeuvre is rich and is a direct inspiration for this project, but I failed to find any evidence those puzzles ever existed and possibly are the product of my imagination. \n\nThe same case is with fairy tales and their true and \"untrue\" nature. A hero embarks on a journey where various events unfold in seemingly random or loosely connected ways. The occurrences sometimes lead to improbable plot twists, but these enigmatic transformations ultimately bring the story full circle, evoking a sense of familiarity combined with an air of mystery.\n\nOn this Enchanted journey, you might end up in one of five possible scenes: Fairy Lake, Magic Wetlands, Giant's Woods, Over 7 Seas and 7 Mountains, or Enchanted Forest. Look out for the FOMO keyboard key to visit more locations.\n\nUse [s] key in live view to save output as PNG. \n\n----\nEnchanted was part of the Blind Gallery x Feral File Vistas Edition.\nLearn more at https://www.blindgallery.xyz/ ",
