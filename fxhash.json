            "description": "Laboratory of curious graphic studies.\n\nImagine an old file found near Weinar, containing the graphic research of a geometry enthusiast...\n\nA geometric figure with each side composed of a certain number of points (between 10 and 100) undergoes a rotation.\n\nA grain, or \"granularity\"  brings a pencil effect that gives the illusion of old archives rescued from a secret's Bauhaus laboratory. Old illustrations whose paper would have undergone the damage of time.\n\nFeatures:\n- Paper: yellowed, cracked and dry most of the time, but there were a few pages found with the marks of time bleached out.\n- Basic shape type: Polygons, sometimes stars. \n- Symmetry: Perfectly symmetrical geometrical shapes, but not always!\n- x' and y' : parameters for the deformation, based on the Lissajous equations. The value for x is very often 1, the other values are totally random between 1 and 10, but it seems that there are 30 too.\n- Length Loop : Time to draw the shape, usually 800 frames but we have seen some at 400 frames and others at 1600. \n- Granularity: 100 levels of granularity.\n- Sides or branches : Mostly between 3 and 5.\n- Points per sides or branches : around 50 (Gaussian Standard Deviation : 15).\n\nControls:\n[ENTER] to pause or restart playback.\n[s] to download the image*.\n\n*The maximum print size is limited by the resolution and power of your computer. See https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/how-to-print-generative-art to print at high resolutions.\n\nMade with the javascript framework P5.js\n\nJérôme Mercier - @generativePunk - https://www.pizza-punk.com \nDecember, 2022",

            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

All seeds begin in the middle.\n\nA couple resolutions: 256, 512, 1024, 2048 (larger is rarer)\nAll other parameters change the behavior, colorization, and animation of each piece.\nThis is a larger edition, since the parameter space is very wide.\n\nEach piece is lightly interactive. During growth, more seeds can be added by clicking and drawing into untraversed territory.\n\nWhen viewing the piece live, you can press the 's' key to take a capture. Captures may be scaled to any desired resolution using 'nearest-neighbor' scaling.\n\nMade with p5.js, p5Fbo.js, and glsl  ",

            "description": "A mix of aesthetics from the Ukiyo-e and Shin-hanga woodblock movements, with modern elements.  \n\nukiyo-e (浮世絵) = \"pictures of the floating world\", which peaked in the late 19th century. \nshin-hanga (新版画) = \"new prints\", from roughly the 1920-1950s. \n\nSome comparisons between the prints of the Japanese masters and gen-art: \n\n* The number of prints. Based on how well a piece was received, the publisher could decide to produce more copies, usually in batches of 200. Compare this to limiting the edition size on fx(hash). The initial prints would have sharp lines and accurately coloured areas. Very popular prints with thousands of impressions would slowly degrade the blocks, leaving final prints with worn-out linework and colours that weren't true to originals.  \n\n* Woodblock prints were actually a collab between the artist, the wood carver, and the printer. In many cases only the artist and publisher were recognized on the final prints. It was usually the publisher who owned the woodblock, not the artist. Often the artist was considered a worker, contracted at the request of the publisher or patrons funding the project. Compare this to the NFT space, where ownership is carved onto the blockchain, and artists have freedom to create whatever they wish. \n\n* Copyminters.... Similar to the NFT world, fake publishers sprang up from time to time, who would reproduce famous prints. Enji Takamizawa was one such counterfeiter, who was able to skilfully produce woodblocks replicating originals down to the wood grain! \n\n* While fine-quality woodblock prints from the Edo era command huge auction prices today, they were in reality affordable art for the regular people of their time. NFTs are similar in this light, where we can enjoy pieces at home rather than say, visiting galleries or museums of unattainable art. \n\n\n\nAdditional querystring params (use when viewing in a separate window) \n\n* fullsize=true (33 megapixel output) \n* colourcorrect=false \n* grain=false \n* border=false \n\n\n\nLicenses included in source. Relying on: \n\n* PIXIJS for drawing \n* JSTS for geometry functions \n* chromajs for colour functions \n* noise and gaussian helpers from p5js ",
