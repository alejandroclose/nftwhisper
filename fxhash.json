A whole new understanding of colour blindness should unfold as you struggle through inaccessibility yourself.\n\nThe 640x400px canvas consists of 25 rows, with 80 columns per row for a total of 2000 letters, using only 16 glyphs from the Codepage 437 character set scaled to a resolution of 8x16 pixels per character.\n\nCodepage 437 is the original IBM PC-ASCII font from August 1981, often referred to as the DOS font.",

This term we learned about biodiversity and how biodiversity loss affects us and the world around us.  All the images in this project are hand-drawn (on an iPad) by me.\n\nI will be donating all proceeds from the minting of this project to plant trees.  Secondary royalties will be kept by me.  Thank you all ahead of time for your support!",

Additional patterns are combined in the grid with these distortions to create the final artwork.\n\nPatterns for the individual blocks in the grid are divided into categories, and various amounts are picked for each work, with dozens of possible mixtures. Patterns can flow in different directions across the varied canvases. Distribution of these patterns across the grid varies from work to work, providing for different feels as they bunch together or spread apart.",
