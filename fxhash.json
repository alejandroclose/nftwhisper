            "description": "The Corium is a roughly spherical mass (diameter ~1km), of currently unknown origins situated within the core region of the solar system's asteroid belt.\nThe body was discovered during a uranium extraction mission undertaken by ET Resources at the behest of Station 733-H (Mars colony) leadership, when ionising radiation levels detected by deployed surface craft exceeded equipment and personnel tolerance levels by many orders of magnitude.\n\nWhile ETR crew were quick to respond to local abort orders (27 minutes from initial readings to fleet reorientation); Station 733-H made the determination that radiation exposure levels were already far in excess of anything that could be reasonably mitigated upon the ETR fleet's return.\nThe ETR fleet was ordered to jettison fuel reserves under Section 9 of the Space Corporations Act (Mars) approximately 90 minutes after the readings were initially reported. It is understood that all deployed personnel accessed their barbiturate rations within the following 24 hours.\n\nThe fleet itself remains in position some ~3000kms from The Corium, with plans to relocate the vessels still underway (albeit a low priority).\n\n\nSTATION 733-H OBSERVATION REPORT SUMMARY (14.1.1)\n\nTo date, remote analysis suggests that the body is compositionally similar to corium deposits observed following terrestrial nuclear disasters, consisting of a range of solidified radioactive compounds as well as a number of currently unidentified metal alloys. More in-depth analysis has been impossible to date due to the rapid physical decay of personnel and equipment as their proximity to samples reach a critical threshold.\n\nAll samples have so far been extruded from the surface of The Corium via laser, and maneuvered into orbit around Mars at the edge of it's sphere of influence (at a distance of no less than 50,000kms from Station 733-H), via projectile barrage and gas envelopment.\n\nThe surface of The Corium itself is littered with an array of clearly engineered forms; radial and rectangular patterns, deep crevasses, mazes and grids with only a select few areas resembling the pools of lava observed where Corium has formed terrestrially (it is unclear whether these deposits have formed since the surface was initially engineered).\n\nThe accompanying files are LIDAR renders of the extracted samples in proximity to Station 733-H and are marked for dissemination to terrestrial research teams on Mars. Study of The Corium remains the sole priority of Station 733-H research personnel, as any risks presented to the solar system or its inhabitants are currently not well understood.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe piece will render from the top right and might take ~5-10 seconds to begin.\n\nAppend \"&print=true\" to the live render URL for a hi-res output.",

They are portals opening our view to rich content.\n\nThis work is a portal to itself. It loads itself within itself 20 times. It's not pretty, it reminds us of WordArt, it's a little bit hacky, it might break when our tools to display HTML will change. But it's a proof that the limits of our tools are only limits until creativity breaks them.\n\nThis work is not purely deterministic, because it simply cannot be. Slight timing differences due to loading times being different each time an <iframe> is loaded will make each visualization slightly unique.\n\nIf you view this token on mobile, the nesting limit was reduced to 4 to prevent performance issues.\n\nThis work is highly experimental. It leverages a \"hack\" to allow iframes to be nested.\nFirefox max <iframe> nesting depth as of 28/12/2021 is capped at 9.\nWorks with chrome desktop 96.0.4664.110",

It's about the loneliness, energy dependency of our species and our interest towards monumental constructions.\n\n------\n\nIn 3541, when Solitude was far from its former glory, the high council was assembling; it's now time to find a new way to live. It has been centuries since our people started to harness the power of the stars, but they used every last bit of power to serve as a mass effort to bring people together and strengthen solidarity. But now just a few remain.. With a shortage of manpower and energy, everything decayed so quickly. Now this isolated civilization is built upon the dying stars and waiting for the eternal void. \n\nIt's time for the high council to assemble for one last time to decide what to do next…\n\n------\n\nThe first 5 collectors at the highest tier(60 xtz) will receive an airdrop of an additional edition minted by us and also will have a guaranteed reserve spot for our next collection.\n\nIn live mode, press ‘s’ to save as .png (4000 x 7111 px) - You can check the console to confirm if the render is finished.\n\nPlease beware there are some minor differences  -caused by different pixel densities- between the saved .png and work on the site.\n\nIt can take up to a minute to render or longer in low-performance computers.

Sometimes we strictly follow the paths we are destined for.  Sometimes we meander in our own way and on our own time.  Let’s explore the ways that these different paths can create beauty.\n=================~~~~~~~===========\n\n\n============Adherence?=============\nThe title feature of Adherence controls how obediently each of the streamers follow their curated path and whether they die off when destined. While each mint will have a default level of adherence, everyone will be able to see what their piece would look like at all other levels of obedience.\n\nYou might prefer to live life conservatively doing everything that is expected of you…but then you’ll be surprised at what joy and beauty can come from a rebellious spirit.\n\n\n============No Restraint============\nThis project is definitely not a lesson in artistic restraint. It has been very exciting for me to grow this project along with my learnings. I’ve spent 6 months building, adding, cutting, and tweaking.

            "description": "This project is about uncovering artifacts.\n\nEach piece is determined by approximately 15 parameters. This allows for a multitude of possible forms, and each iteration is an artifact to be discovered within the multidimensional space.\n\nThis work is focused around discovery. It is about exploring the space of the algorithm, shedding light on its many forms, and sometimes finding artifacts of the real world embedded within them.\n\nTechnically, this work is a composition of three primary elements: Voronoi tessellations, orthographic projection, and the depth-sort algorithm.\nThe latter of these is integral to the rendering mechanism. It works intuitively, drawing distant objects before near objects, evaluating the distance of each object according to its geometric center. It does this precisely, and in doing so, it can produce interesting visual artifacts, drawing some shapes in an unexpected order.\n\n\n\nThis has been a fascinating study, bringing light to unreal shapes and forms, and uncovering artifacts in an impossible space.\n\nI hope you enjoy it,\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Notes:\n- Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done.",

            "description": "https://www.bfos.art/projects/adherence\n\n======~~~~~~~~~~===================\nWe aren’t all moving in the same direction.  Sometimes we strictly follow the paths we are destined for.  Sometimes we meander in our own way and on our own time.  Let’s explore the ways that these different paths can create beauty.\n=================~~~~~~~===========\n\n\n============Adherence?=============\nThe title feature of Adherence controls how obediently each of the streamers follow their curated path and whether they die off when destined. While each mint will have a default level of adherence, everyone will be able to see what their piece would look like at all other levels of obedience.\n\nYou might prefer to live life conservatively doing everything that is expected of you…but then you’ll be surprised at what joy and beauty can come from a rebellious spirit.\n\n\n============No Restraint============\nThis project is definitely not a lesson in artistic restraint. It has been very exciting for me to grow this project along with my learnings. I’ve spent 6 months building, adding, cutting, and tweaking.  All of this wrestling has left an embarrassingly mangled code base.  That said, I truly believe the diversity of the output-space is worth it.  \n\nDuring development, I encountered some very severe roadblocks, some of which I felt I might never be able to resolve. One in particular, related to ensuring this project is dimensionless, actually brought me to tears once I finally worked through it. Similarly, there were a fair number of major leaps that took just a few minutes from concept to implementation. \n\nMy objective for my next project will be to bring more restraint…for the sake of my sanity if nothing else. It might take me just as long to complete and I expect that it will be a far smaller release, but I’ll still put just as much care into making sure I deliver a quality project for anyone willing to mint.\n\n\n============Open and Ugly============\nI won’t be obscuring my code.  Anyone is free to use browser dev tools to look and learn to their heart’s content.\n\nBe ye forewarned, though.  It’s not pretty.  I started out well enough, but little tweaks here and there to play and expand on the project has resulted in a code base I might be a little embarrassed about.\n\nBut, that’s OK!  We are all in this together and maybe this will be a way of helping others not feel intimidated by a sense of perfection.  I have also included fairly verbose comments, too, as added commentary to my insanity.\n\nI hope that my openness and vulnerability will be seen by everyone in the community as an invitation to connect with me for any reason.  If you'd like to ask me any questions about this project, about my collecting, about learning to code, about working through challenges, or whatever else...please don't hesitate to ping me in just about any of the fx(hash) related discords (Kaloh's, TENDER, fx(hash), clewcrew) or on twitter.  \n\n\n============Interactions============\n{F}eatures\n{P}rogress\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{N}oise Switch\n{1-3} Adjust Adherence\n{4-9} Save at x² resolution\n{I}nfinite Animation Modes - [Experimental] \n\nThere are two infinite animation modes.  I call them experimental because they didn't quite reach the level of polish that I would have preferred.  \n\nThe first mode is a loop-with-reverse.  It runs efficiently, but I think it's a little too obvious what it is doing.  It also messes with the background color.\n\nThe second mode is a more subtle loop that I actually love, but performance is VERY dependent on your device.  My M1 Mac runs it fairly well, but most other devices struggle through frames.  Even at a lower framerate, I think it's a neat effect.  Though, I wish I was able to figure out a way to improve the performance.  I tried a lot of tricks, but none helped that much.\n\n======~~~~~~~~~~==============================~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~==============================\n\n",
