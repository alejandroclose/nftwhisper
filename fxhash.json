            "description": "fx_doughs is a generative project based on our original \"DONUT HEADS\" design created by @dirtyblackghost(Twitter) and first used in 2017. The signature design was made for the Butternut Deluxe podcast promotional and social media posts. Since entering the NFT space in 2021 (February) and watching the rise of PFP/collectable projects we always wanted to make our own. With fx_hash and @PureSpider(Twitter) template we realized this dream of making a project like this. Enjoy!\n\nMain artist other links:\n@dirty_black_ghost(Instagram)",

Furthermore, I started experimenting with large pieces of canvas, placed them at different heights, and poured vast layers of acrylic fluid paint on them.\nThe energy of these paintings is incredible. As I layer the colors, the colors begin to converse. It seems to have the color of its own mind.\nI started with an image in mind, but always, painting takes over everything. Using canvas installed at different heights requires careful thinking and planning in advance. Sometimes the color goes into a new shape that I did not expect, but I correct it and use it to the fullest. This kind of art creates exciting and psychological paintings!\nColor flow is instantaneous. I am constantly spinning around the canvas and directing the flow; there is no time but to go with the flow. I started as a guide, but I know that I've just been an active agent - letting the song of colors sing and flow.\n- Press \"S\" to save an artwork.\n- Collectors who own this NFT have the right to print the work.\nMade with p5js.",

            "description": "Uninhabitable is a generative system built only from ellipses. The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state. Press \"h\" to save it.\n\nUninhabitable is an original work by Iskra Velitchkova. 2021.",

            "description": "We divide spaces into smaller spaces which we conquer and live in our solitude. We call that Metropolis.\n\nStarted this piece as a rule based generative art. Simply the algorithm takes a rectangle and throws 2 random points inside it within defined x and y distances. Then using those 2 points, algorithm draws another rectangle and assigns letters to the corners of rectangle \"A,B,C,D\" starting from top left corner in clockwise direction. Then it starts to draw cells from inner rectangle's corner A to parent's corner A and goes on. Once 4 cells are created, it creates 4 more cells in between other cells, thus dividing a rectangle into 9 pieces. This is where \"IX\" comes from. Depending on the cell properties; algorithm assigns circles, triangles, lines and points to cells creating a city scape when certain parameters are given to the division algorithm.\n\nThere are 18 possible outcomes:\n\"Hazy Day\" 13% probability (half of this style will come with slightly more color transition)\n\"Hazy Night\" 10% probability\n\"Crystal Day\" 11% probability\n\"Crystal Night\" 5% probability\n\"Mondrian Day\"  3% probability\n\"Mondrian Night\" 3% probability\n\"Bauhaus Day\" 3% probability\n\"Bauhaus Night\" 3% probability\n\"1 Chroma Day\" 4% probability (Multiple values of a single hue on a monochrome gradient)\n\"Mondrian Crystal Day\" 3% probability\n\"Mondrian Crystal Night\" 3% probability\n\"Monochrome Day\" 3% probability \n\"Monochrome Night\" 4% probability \n\"Vibrant Day\" 12% probability\n\"Vibrant Night\" 9% probability\n\"Rainbow Day' 5% probability\n\"Rainbow Night' 3% probability\n\"Chaotic Day\"   3% probability (which takes pretty random parameters and 25% of this outcome has probability of creating very first coloring style of the project, see console for the hidden feature)\n\n\n\n\nPress \"1\" to download 1000px height PNG\nPress \"2\" to download 2000px height PNG\nPress \"3\" to download 3000px height PNG\nPress \"4\" to download 4000px height PNG\nPress \"5\" to download 5000px height PNG\nPress \"6\" to download 6000px height PNG\nPress \"7\" to download 7000px height PNG\nPress \"8\" to download 8000px height PNG\nPress \"9\" to download 12000px height PNG\nPress \"m' to download 900x1600px PNG for mobile wallpaper\n\nUse CTRL+SHIFT+C or CMD+SHIFT+C to open console for hidden features\n\nCreated from scratch with p5.js \nMurat Atimtay 2022 | @atimtay | www.muratatimtay.com \n",

            "description": "Watercolor painting was my favorite technique for playing. I love combining colors, merging and blending them together. Furthermore, I started experimenting with large pieces of canvas, placed them at different heights, and poured vast layers of acrylic fluid paint on them.\nThe energy of these paintings is incredible. As I layer the colors, the colors begin to converse. It seems to have the color of its own mind.\nI started with an image in mind, but always, painting takes over everything. Using canvas installed at different heights requires careful thinking and planning in advance. Sometimes the color goes into a new shape that I did not expect, but I correct it and use it to the fullest. This kind of art creates exciting and psychological paintings!\nColor flow is instantaneous. I am constantly spinning around the canvas and directing the flow; there is no time but to go with the flow. I started as a guide, but I know that I've just been an active agent - letting the song of colors sing and flow.\n- Press \"S\" to save an artwork.\n- Collectors who own this NFT have the right to print the work.\nMade with p5js.",
