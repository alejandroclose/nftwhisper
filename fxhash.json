Some routines I re-use for 30 years now. \nAlthough often they have changed over time.\n\n\nVanilla javascript - And directly control your rgb buffer\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\ncons:\n- can be overwhelming for starting coders compared to p5js\n- you have to write / use and tinker with new drawing routines by yourself. \n- still can be optimized a lot, and run much faster\n-- (feel free to do that! - release new versions yourself)\n- I just coded it in Notepad++ and tested it in a browser.\n- I have no experience with git-hub, or those other nifty tools\n- I'm more an Artist than a coder, still learning new things as well.\n- I have my own 'old' coding style I picked up ages ago, and still use now and then. Started with basic and Z80a as a teenager.\n- for sure there are still some stupid bugs, spelling errors in it  ^___^\n\npros:\n- fxtemplate - fxpreview when done drawing / splash-screen support on top; while drawing.\n- do like 4000 x 4000 images on safari; on an old Iphone 5\n- just 1 index.html now - small file size: \n- the source of the 'cleaned-up' version is now 34b (not minified, and still comments in the source; can be even smaller)\n- direct control of the RGB buffer; every pixel.\n- I added some basic routines, like drawing points, lines, squares, sprite-brushes, filters, and my pixel-font\n- draw, add-mix or subtract - manipulate every pixel how you wish\n- I work with a big off-screen kind of image; a rgb-buffer; so drawing goes 'mucho' faster and render it to a screen-scaled image.\n- no other libraries used\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nMouse-click switches between:\n- screen scaled image\n- The large image \n\n- The work will refresh and restart after some time\n\nSave image - with s-key \n(includes the fxhash key-seed and num# of the follow-up images)\n--- It can take some seconds before the saving happens; \n--- the browser has to handle (very) large MB .png files first \n--- before it can save them \n\n- splash image support - to hide drawing at start\n- redraw the image after a while; or not.\n- mouse position check for the bigger image\n- fps counter for testing etc.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nwritten in vanilla JavaScript, more info in the source-code\n\n\ndrawz - latest or an updated version can be found at.\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\nIt would be nice; to include more routines into it\nin the future.\n\nAnd instead of 1 big library with everything in it\nI would like to have these templates; \nwhere you can add different little snippets and routines \nthat you want to use into it, and start playing next.\nStill learning new things as well. And getting inspired.\n\nI don't mind people to use the tech-source as a start for their own projects. \n\nBut the palette, and composition & structure build-up; is mine. \nDon't change just 1 or 2 -things then re-release it.\n\nIf you want to release something of your own,\nyour sketch and generative work; really should look total different!\nYou can use the technics to draw new things,\nbut you have to start from scratch again; \nchoosing points, lines etc. to play with and go from there.\nEnjoy! \n\n\n-for the love of Art and jumping in rain puddles-\n\n'like jimi and guitar'  0__.  ^____^\n\n\nxxx  amsterdam  chillout\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n",

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

            "description": "Verdant translates to “lush, green” and Brut means “dry, raw, or unrefined.”\n\nThis series is less about impressions of nature, or vegetal growth… but rather the vibrant, lush world that abstract art can provide and while certain iterations may serve Brutalist aesthetics, it tries to focus on the unrefined/raw aspect of the definition with more fluid shapes that feel irregular and organic in a playful, almost adolescent way.\n\nPalettes inspired by MOMO, Melissa Wiederrecht, Erik Swahn, Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, Paul Klee, Mareva Millarc, Ernst Mether-Borgström, Douglas Herbert Courtenay Auburn, Jim Harris, Alayne Spafford, Man Ray, Lajos Kassak and William Lachance. While the palettes may not always reflect their trademark colors (if they even have any) they are an homage to individual pieces by the respective artists that have influenced this series in their own way.\n\n4878 bytes of Vanilla JS with no libraries.\n\nFor more info on the chosen palettes and other inspirations, see article linked from the main project page: Regarding Verdant Brut\n\nIn live mode:\n‘S’ : save as png (2376 × 3360)\n’V’ : save as svg (without grain)\n\nURL params in live mode:\n‘g=n’ : no grain\n‘g=p’ : paper grain\n‘h=t’ : high resolution mode, 5940 × 8400 (Chrome only)\n\nFor example, if you wanted paper grain in high resolution, append “&g=p&h=t” to the url in live mode.\n\nAfter rendering with these params, tapping 'P' will then save the png with those settings applied.",

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

At what point do you feel the dots begin to dissolve into a texture? When do you stop noticing the dots and instead begin to perceive the overall composition?\n\nThese questions are posed in a similar fashion as with meditation; at what point does something become something else? When does an in-breath become an out-breath and vice versa? \n\nContemplation on simple questions like these can open a small portal into stillness and mindfulness by taking time to slowly observe our responses. \n\n23 palettes are included, each named after different areas of Tokyo. \n\nPress 'S' to download a full size 6000px x 6000px PNG output. \n\nAs always, much gratitude and enjoy your piece.

When does an in-breath become an out-breath and vice versa? \n\nContemplation on simple questions like these can open a small portal into stillness and mindfulness by taking time to slowly observe our responses. \n\n23 palettes are included, each named after different areas of Tokyo. \n\nPress 'S' to download a full size 6000px x 6000px PNG output. \n\nAs always, much gratitude and enjoy your piece.

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.
