We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "Schwere See\n(...which is german for \"Heavy Seas\")\n\nthis work creates completely generative ocean worlds between the real and the surreal.\nwhat is real? when do we feel reality? i guess as with many other things, we feel reality best when we're deprived of it.\nThat might be the reason why it never ceases to fascinate us to both exaggerate and abstract nature and reality - maybe even at the same time.\nthat's where this work tries to go...\ngiving my best to create realistic looking waves out of hmm... thin electron-gas..., and then disrupt those from realism by unnaturally exaggerating waveforms and abstracting the display to a few colors and lines - ...well, not so few of the latter, actually ;-)\n\nbeware: this needs a good GPU (at least here in 2023) to properly run in realtime.\nstills can still be rendered on a low end machine with on-board graphics, but for realtime playing you'd need some proper dedicated graphics card.\nand of course it wont run fast (or maybe not all) on your mobile phone (except maybe on a very high end device).\n\nthe different mints vary in wave shape, color, camera view, animation speed, aspect ratio, frame style, hatching density, field of view, and more.\nsome color schemes are based on pre-chosen palettes (slightly varied though), but others are wildly random-generated. there's always some risk in randomness, but lets give the error some chance to surprise us - this is one of the many benefits of generative art.\n\nas generative art can do so much more than just generate/show an image i feel almost obliged to add the possibility to animate/inteact.\nhowever, this extra control shall not be chosen without some considerations. \nyou don't want a strobingly wild animation above your fireplace or in a doctors waiting room. nor is it motion-wise very inspiring to have subtle image stills hanging in a dancefloor.\nso, by default when in animation mode (<space>-key) the scene is very slowly and steadily changing - some pieces faster, some slower. however, by pressing <f> you can toggle to a sped up animation of waves, clouds, and scene rotation.\nbtw, going faster in nav-mode also speeds up the wave animation. (...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

            "description": "Uninhabitable is a generative system built only from ellipses. The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state. Press \"h\" to save it.\n\nUninhabitable is an original work by Iskra Velitchkova. 2021.",

Along the way they may encounter many or none at all; each instance defining its past and future. The only knowns are that this will be the only path they take and that it'll always end.\n\nEnjoy watching the structures form. Due to the nature of the system it may take some time to complete.

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

We all feel this way from time to time — in our lives, jobs, bodies, situations — yet in our search for something, we shouldn't forget that there can still be beauty along the path.\n\nThe project takes some inspiration from Henri Matisse, both in the aesthetics of his later works (i.e. the \"Cut Outs\") and metaphorically in the sense that he had underwent medical treatment which left him wheelchair- or bed-bound towards the later part of his life, forcing him to give up painting, yet in his exploration of this new creative medium which involved cutting paper and pinning them up, his unorthodox work went on to become the most transformative of his career.\n\nReleased as part of the 4th edition of the Cure³ Parkinson's cure fundraiser exhibition organized by Artwise Curators and Bonhams as part of a specially comissioned selection of generative artists minting NFTs, curated by Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick with the support of fx(hash) at Bonhams, London from 13-17th January 2023.\n\n---\n33% of primary sales and 3% of secondary sales will be donated on-chain to Cure Parkinson’s\n---\n\nControls:\n• 'R' regenerates the piece (e.g. in case the window size changes)\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Jan 2023\nArtist: Yazid",

            "description": "This project is about uncovering artifacts.\n\nEach piece is determined by approximately 15 parameters. This allows for a multitude of possible forms, and each iteration is an artifact to be discovered within the multidimensional space.\n\nThis work is focused around discovery. It is about exploring the space of the algorithm, shedding light on its many forms, and sometimes finding artifacts of the real world embedded within them.\n\nTechnically, this work is a composition of three primary elements: Voronoi tessellations, orthographic projection, and the depth-sort algorithm.\nThe latter of these is integral to the rendering mechanism. It works intuitively, drawing distant objects before near objects, evaluating the distance of each object according to its geometric center. It does this precisely, and in doing so, it can produce interesting visual artifacts, drawing some shapes in an unexpected order.\n\n\n\nThis has been a fascinating study, bringing light to unreal shapes and forms, and uncovering artifacts in an impossible space.\n\nI hope you enjoy it,\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Notes:\n- Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done.",

After the roses are fully formed, a random mask of heavy ink is algorithmically screened over the flowers in a pattern of horizontal or vertical lines, occasionally fully flooding the painting. The accumulation of choices evokes graffiti or printmaking. The sequence of choices are interpreted by the computer according to the algorithm. The beauty of these choices are determined by the viewer.\n\nEach piece takes roughly 10 seconds to generate.\n\nArtist: @sarah_ridgley\nPress [s] to save the image\nJavaScript / p5js | script size: 11kb\n\n",

After that made this generative stuff for fxhash's birthday bash.\n\n#fxhashturnsone\n\nDonations:\n25% to ThreeJs team\n\nThe image contains a binary coded word or phrase with a length of 8 characters. The grays represents 0, the other colors represents 1. One row -> one character. Should be proceed decoding from left to right and from top to bottom.\n\nAn example: 'iloveyou'\n\n01101001\n01101100\n01101111\n01110110\n01100101\n01111001\n01101111\n01110101\n\nThe fxrandom selects a word and the program converts it to binary data. After that, the background (ground and sky) is randomly generated from color schemes. Then the binary gray colors are drawn. Also the color of light next to null colors is randomly generated from color schemes. Random affects also the animation.\n\nThe animation stops when you do these interactions below, then restarts after a few seconds of inactivity.\n\nPress spacebar to change:\n\n- frame view -> without frame\n- without frame -> original 8x8px size\n- original 8x8px size -> frame view\n\nPress 's' to save an svg from current view.\n\nNotes:\n- Build with ReactJs and TweenJs\n- Every upcoming day, half of the remaining pieces are burned.\n\nHappy Birthday fxhash community!\nI'm glad to be among you!",

            "description": "The code work I am most interested in creating with p5js in 2022 is a type of creation where various elements are developed in a drow() loop based on an initial state.\n\"Flux\" also recursively generates visual images based on the initial state. The result is a form reminiscent of architecture, cityscapes, or neural networks.\n\nThrough the use of the noise() function, the code initially draws lines that are then extended vertically and randomly slide across a certain area.  By repeating this process recurrently, the work itself becomes a visual image, with itself as a constituent element, while being damaged.\n\n\"Flux\" is also a work about autopoiesis (or self-organization) in damage.\n\nThe get()set() is to treat the image generated by the code as an image(), and it may damage the purity of the work as a code. Therefore, I view random get()set() as a metaphor for damage.\n\nThe parameter “interrupt” has a certain probability of being “true”; if it is “true”, the density of the strokes is reduced, but in combination with other parameters, it is not easy to determine whether interrupt is “true” or “false”. Therefore, it is a practically meaningless parameter (attribute), but I added this parameter to imagine an artificiality in the code of nature.\n\nCreating a dimensionless image (one that maintains the same output regardless of screen size) was a challenge due to the inevitable deterioration in resolution and rendering content when the same processing is performed at a smaller size. In order to prioritize resolution, the image was generated at a fixed size and displayed according to the screen size.\n\nIt is possible to get a 3240 x 5760 px png file by right click save.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries.\n\nArtwork by hasaqui, @hasaqui.\nMade with p5js\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "This generative automaton specializes in making pencil drawings of flower bouquets. It represents an attempt to capture some of the shapes, textures and nuances typical of hand-made drawings through algorithmic means. \n\nIt is a continuation of the exploration initiated with my previous work “The Likeness of a Flower”, a generator of expressionist flower paintings.\n\nStrongly inspired by the astonishing work of British artist Claudia Lowry: https://www.instagram.com/claudialowry_art/\n\n100% code – no assets. Made with p5.js.\nThis work is animated.\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 1000 x 1000 resolution. Please note that rendering at high resolutions can be slow.\n",
