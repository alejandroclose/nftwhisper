            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

Auction will stop changing price when non-reserves are fully minted.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nNature’s wild flourish and untamed growth wondrously represent the exacting function of beauty — a function that is at once useful and infinitely creative. Perhaps nowhere is this delicate symbiosis better observed than in the flower, wherein a pure balance of physical fundamentals exists beneath ornate patterns and elaborate aesthetics.\n\nAmongst the layers of undulating, vividly colored petals, attention-grabbing stigma and stamen, and lusciously decorative features, nature’s organic abundance and disorder disguises its masterful propensity for precision. Each of the flower’s components evolve through unpredictable interactions with an unwieldy natural environment, creating spectacular adaptations that emerge from the tension between what attracts.\n\nRococo painters appreciated the organic fluidity found in flowers and vegetal forms, using their joyful abundance to depict a break from the rigid and stoic period the artists hoped to leave behind. They sought to reframe perfection away from predictability and toward compositions as surprising as the natural world around them.\n\nThus, ‘Rococo’ is a generative distortion of an old tradition: a digital painting created entirely with code that interprets and processes the natural world’s dichotomies. This painting algorithm builds upon natural structures while melding and moving their colors beyond form, growing randomly organic iterations that are as perfect as they are imperfect.\n\nCreated by Ori Ben-Shabat & Ronen Tanchum @Phenomenalabs\nCreative contributions from Tender @tender_art\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTechnical Details:\n\n- Mobile/GPU Intensive\n- Press “s” to save a .png of the artwork in live view\n- Press “p” to render a high res output + press “s” to save a printable .png",

The focus will be on using these shapes and patterns to create dynamic and visually interesting compositions, both in 2D and 3D forms. The project begins by studying the use of grids and how they can be used to create structure and balance in a composition. Next, the use of cubes will be examined, and how they can be used to add depth and dimension to a composition. Finally, the project will delve into the use of patterns and how they can be used to create movement and interest within a composition.",

            "description": "In the dreamlike landscape of our minds, the specter of fears is like a wraith, ever-present and ethereal. It whispers in our ear, reminding us of all the things we dare not face. It is a shadow that falls across our hearts, casting a pall of doubt and uncertainty. But even as it haunts us, we must remember that it is a part of us. We must learn to accept its presence, and to use it to our advantage. For fear is not always a curse, it is a guide that shows us where we must grow stronger. It is a companion that walks with us through the dark night, illuminating the path ahead. By embracing our fears, we find the courage to face them, and to overcome them. We find the strength to live fully, to love fiercely, and to pursue our dreams with abandon.\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nSpecter of Fears by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2023\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",
