            "description": "### OVERVIEW ###\nThis project revisits some of the foundational ideas in my previous work \"Above (The Infinite)\" and makes them available in a parameterized form for your exploration.\n\nThis project both rewards and requires exploration. I intentionally left the parameter space very broad so that edge case configurations would be possible. In practice this means that additional curation beyond the initial random parameters will very likely be required, in a way that mimics my day to day experience as a generative artist.\n\nThanks to Karsten Schmidt for his excellent thi.ng libraries (https://thi.ng/), which form the technical foundation upon which this work was built.\n\n### CONTROLS ###\ne - Save the current frame as a PNG\nspace - Pause/Resume animation\n\n### PARAMETERS ###\nNOTE: Some combinations of parameters will cause flashing/strobing, which is why I have attached the \"Epileptic Seizure\" label to the project.\n\n* Color Palette: The color palette to apply to the output.\n* Merge Technique: The method used to combine the different patterns.\n* Patterns: The various patterns that can be combined to form the overall resulting tiled pattern.\n* Pattern Scales: The scales used to combine patterns. Higher scale values provide more visible pattern repetition.\n* Deformers: An optional additional spatial deformation of a pattern.\n* Deformer Scales: The scale of the deformation itself. Lower values use less of the deformation space, while higher values include more.\n* Detail: Acts as a filter on the visual complexity of the overall tiled pattern. Lower values will reduce visual complexity, while higher values will increase it.\n* Rotation Rate/Scroll Rates: How fast should the image rotate or scroll. Note: adjusting these parameters may result in visuals that trigger motion sickness.\n* Zoom: Lower values zoom in, higher values zoom out.\n* Round Scales Up?: When checked the pattern scales are rounded up to the nearest integer.\n* Animate?: Should some parameters be adjusted with the passing of time?\n* Low Res?: When checked, force device pixel density to 1, which reduces strain on the GPU, but may result in graphical artifacts. I usually keep this unchecked unless I want to lighten the load on the GPU.\n* Anti-alias?: When checked each pixel will be sampled multiple times to attempt to smooth out possible aliasing. This will put more load on the GPU, and will typically be slower. Can be useful when \"Low Res?\" is enabled.\n\n### HOWTO ###\nHere's how I find interesting things.\n\nFirst, I lock all of the parameters below \"Pattern 3\" at their default values. I will also usually lock both Deformers to \"Empty\", as they can sometimes hide interesting patterns while exploring, and then I experiment with enabling one or both once I have found something interesting.\n\nYou can also explore the options individually (to a certain degree) by setting other patterns to \"Empty\". This can make how patterns affect one another more obvious when you set them.\n\nAt this point I'll randomize the parameters, and then do one of the following:\n\n- If I see something that's extremely noisy/detailed, I'll turn down the \"Detail\" level, which can sometimes smooth things out.\n\n- If a tiling is very tight, I'll lower the \"Zoom\" to see more of the pattern, or the reverse if I want to see more overview.\n\n- If there's still a lot of aliasing/noise in the image, sometimes enabling anti-aliasing will help, but that will affect performance. I usually try to adjust the Scale/Detail/Zoom before resorting to anti-aliasing.\n\n- Interesting patterns are formed by the scale factors controlling how pattern overlap happens. Sometimes enabling \"Round Scales Up?\" will introduce some appealing visual symmetry.\n\n- Enable one or both of the deformers to see what impact they have on the pattern.\n\nFinally, once I've found a pattern that's interesting, I may enable scrolling or rotation. Note that enabling additional movement can increase graphical aliasing, so anti-aliasing may be required depending on the pattern.\n\nI hope you enjoy the exploration process!\n\n- Jeff Palmer\n",

            "description": "\"The Beauty In Small Things\" marks a new page in my collection of rules-based emergent systems. Like my previous projects,it is based on millions of transparent lines interacting in unpredictable ways. This time, the following rules are applied:\n- Place N circles in the canvas and pick a random point on each circle.\n- Assign a color from the current palette to each point\n- At each step, rotate the point along its circle, and draw a segment between the 2 closest points in the set.\n\nFinding the closest points in a set is another classic computer science problem. This implementation uses the sweep line algorithm to avoid the O(n^2) complexity of the naive method. Rendering still requires a good GPU (with the density at its maximum, it draws 5.7 million lines)\n\nPlaying with the token parameters will reward collectors with very diverse and unexpected outputs.\n\nFor this token I have added 2 important parameters:\n- Hash Override: when set to a valid hash value, this forces using this value for the token generation. This allows collectors to mint the exact same output as the one they see while adjusting the parameters.\n- Micro Variation: one downside of using Hash Override is that the same output can be generated multiple time, by using the same hash. The Micro Variation parameters counterbalances that, by adding a variable amount of randomness taken from the original mint hash. This ensures the output\nwill be very similar to the one currently displayed, but not exactly identical.\n*** WARNING *** If Micro-Variation is set to 0, the output is 100% deterministic and other collectors will be able to generate the exact same output by copying the Hash Override value.\n\nLike \"The Traveling Salesman\", \"The Beauty In Small Things\" is an open edition that starts with 10.000 editions priced at 1tz. After 1 week, the supply will be halved and the price increased by 1tz every day.\n\n75% of the royalties will go to the minters, to reward their creative use of the parameters.\n\nIn Live view, you can use ?s=2 or ?s=3 to render at a higher resolution.\n?noise=0 will turn off the background noise texture.",

Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",

            "description": "### OVERVIEW ###\nThis project revisits some of the foundational ideas in my previous work \"Above (The Infinite)\" and makes them available in a parameterized form for your exploration.\n\nThis project both rewards and requires exploration. I intentionally left the parameter space very broad so that edge case configurations would be possible. In practice this means that additional curation beyond the initial random parameters will very likely be required, in a way that mimics my day to day experience as a generative artist.\n\nThanks to Karsten Schmidt for his excellent thi.ng libraries (https://thi.ng/), which form the technical foundation upon which this work was built.\n\n### CONTROLS ###\ne - Save the current frame as a PNG\nspace - Pause/Resume animation\n\n### PARAMETERS ###\nNOTE: Some combinations of parameters will cause flashing/strobing, which is why I have attached the \"Epileptic Seizure\" label to the project.\n\n* Color Palette: The color palette to apply to the output.\n* Merge Technique: The method used to combine the different patterns.\n* Patterns: The various patterns that can be combined to form the overall resulting tiled pattern.\n* Pattern Scales: The scales used to combine patterns. Higher scale values provide more visible pattern repetition.\n* Deformers: An optional additional spatial deformation of a pattern.\n* Deformer Scales: The scale of the deformation itself. Lower values use less of the deformation space, while higher values include more.\n* Detail: Acts as a filter on the visual complexity of the overall tiled pattern. Lower values will reduce visual complexity, while higher values will increase it.\n* Rotation Rate/Scroll Rates: How fast should the image rotate or scroll. Note: adjusting these parameters may result in visuals that trigger motion sickness.\n* Zoom: Lower values zoom in, higher values zoom out.\n* Round Scales Up?: When checked the pattern scales are rounded up to the nearest integer.\n* Animate?: Should some parameters be adjusted with the passing of time?\n* Low Res?: When checked, force device pixel density to 1, which reduces strain on the GPU, but may result in graphical artifacts. I usually keep this unchecked unless I want to lighten the load on the GPU.\n* Anti-alias?: When checked each pixel will be sampled multiple times to attempt to smooth out possible aliasing. This will put more load on the GPU, and will typically be slower. Can be useful when \"Low Res?\" is enabled.\n\n### HOWTO ###\nHere's how I find interesting things.\n\nFirst, I lock all of the parameters below \"Pattern 3\" at their default values. I will also usually lock both Deformers to \"Empty\", as they can sometimes hide interesting patterns while exploring, and then I experiment with enabling one or both once I have found something interesting.\n\nYou can also explore the options individually (to a certain degree) by setting other patterns to \"Empty\". This can make how patterns affect one another more obvious when you set them.\n\nAt this point I'll randomize the parameters, and then do one of the following:\n\n- If I see something that's extremely noisy/detailed, I'll turn down the \"Detail\" level, which can sometimes smooth things out.\n\n- If a tiling is very tight, I'll lower the \"Zoom\" to see more of the pattern, or the reverse if I want to see more overview.\n\n- If there's still a lot of aliasing/noise in the image, sometimes enabling anti-aliasing will help, but that will affect performance. I usually try to adjust the Scale/Detail/Zoom before resorting to anti-aliasing.\n\n- Interesting patterns are formed by the scale factors controlling how pattern overlap happens. Sometimes enabling \"Round Scales Up?\" will introduce some appealing visual symmetry.\n\n- Enable one or both of the deformers to see what impact they have on the pattern.\n\nFinally, once I've found a pattern that's interesting, I may enable scrolling or rotation. Note that enabling additional movement can increase graphical aliasing, so anti-aliasing may be required depending on the pattern.\n\nI hope you enjoy the exploration process!\n\n- Jeff Palmer\n",

            "description": "This experimental project involves an on-chain cellular automaton. The features and cellular automaton rules are derived from the minter's address. Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",

            "description": "### OVERVIEW ###\nThis project revisits some of the foundational ideas in my previous work \"Above (The Infinite)\" and makes them available in a parameterized form for your exploration.\n\nThis project both rewards and requires exploration. I intentionally left the parameter space very broad so that edge case configurations would be possible. In practice this means that additional curation beyond the initial random parameters will very likely be required, in a way that mimics my day to day experience as a generative artist.\n\nThanks to Karsten Schmidt for his excellent thi.ng libraries (https://thi.ng/), which form the technical foundation upon which this work was built.\n\n### CONTROLS ###\ne - Save the current frame as a PNG\nspace - Pause/Resume animation\n\n### PARAMETERS ###\nNOTE: Some combinations of parameters will cause flashing/strobing, which is why I have attached the \"Epileptic Seizure\" label to the project.\n\n* Color Palette: The color palette to apply to the output.\n* Merge Technique: The method used to combine the different patterns.\n* Patterns: The various patterns that can be combined to form the overall resulting tiled pattern.\n* Pattern Scales: The scales used to combine patterns. Higher scale values provide more visible pattern repetition.\n* Deformers: An optional additional spatial deformation of a pattern.\n* Deformer Scales: The scale of the deformation itself. Lower values use less of the deformation space, while higher values include more.\n* Detail: Acts as a filter on the visual complexity of the overall tiled pattern. Lower values will reduce visual complexity, while higher values will increase it.\n* Rotation Rate/Scroll Rates: How fast should the image rotate or scroll. Note: adjusting these parameters may result in visuals that trigger motion sickness.\n* Zoom: Lower values zoom in, higher values zoom out.\n* Round Scales Up?: When checked the pattern scales are rounded up to the nearest integer.\n* Animate?: Should some parameters be adjusted with the passing of time?\n* Low Res?: When checked, force device pixel density to 1, which reduces strain on the GPU, but may result in graphical artifacts. I usually keep this unchecked unless I want to lighten the load on the GPU.\n* Anti-alias?: When checked each pixel will be sampled multiple times to attempt to smooth out possible aliasing. This will put more load on the GPU, and will typically be slower. Can be useful when \"Low Res?\" is enabled.\n\n### HOWTO ###\nHere's how I find interesting things.\n\nFirst, I lock all of the parameters below \"Pattern 3\" at their default values. I will also usually lock both Deformers to \"Empty\", as they can sometimes hide interesting patterns while exploring, and then I experiment with enabling one or both once I have found something interesting.\n\nYou can also explore the options individually (to a certain degree) by setting other patterns to \"Empty\". This can make how patterns affect one another more obvious when you set them.\n\nAt this point I'll randomize the parameters, and then do one of the following:\n\n- If I see something that's extremely noisy/detailed, I'll turn down the \"Detail\" level, which can sometimes smooth things out.\n\n- If a tiling is very tight, I'll lower the \"Zoom\" to see more of the pattern, or the reverse if I want to see more overview.\n\n- If there's still a lot of aliasing/noise in the image, sometimes enabling anti-aliasing will help, but that will affect performance. I usually try to adjust the Scale/Detail/Zoom before resorting to anti-aliasing.\n\n- Interesting patterns are formed by the scale factors controlling how pattern overlap happens. Sometimes enabling \"Round Scales Up?\" will introduce some appealing visual symmetry.\n\n- Enable one or both of the deformers to see what impact they have on the pattern.\n\nFinally, once I've found a pattern that's interesting, I may enable scrolling or rotation. Note that enabling additional movement can increase graphical aliasing, so anti-aliasing may be required depending on the pattern.\n\nI hope you enjoy the exploration process!\n\n- Jeff Palmer\n",

            "description": "2D or not to 2D is a project about geometry, motion and perspective. It began as a simple idea where a rectangule is partitioned into several slices, which in turn are vertically offset by using the same partitioning function.\n\n  Later I added offsets, fake 2D shadows and other elements to convey a sense of dimensionality, where the blocks now occupy a space between 2D and 3D.\n\n  Params:\n    - Number of Slices - Controls the number of individual slices. Sometimes two adjacent slices are merged.\n    - Slant Randomness - Controls the slantedness of the slices.\n    - Vertical Randomness - Controls the difference in height between the slices.\n    - Space Between - Controls the size of the gap between slices.\n    - Motion - The type of motion that the slices follow.\n    - Color Combo - The stroke and background colors of the token.\n    - Invert Colors - Flips the background and stroke color. You can still flip the colors later.\n\n  Controls:\n    - Press S to save an animated GIF of the token - this can take a bit of time, just wait until the indicator says that it's complete.\n    - Press F to invert the current colors.\n    - Press the spacebar to cycle between 5 different modes that control the rotation of the blocks:\n      1. Rotating in tandem\n      2. Rotating in a wave pattern\n      3. Flat\n      4. Rotated\n      5. Interactive based on mouse coordinates\n\n  Shoutouts:\n    - To Tom aka pumaparded for suggesting the awesome title\n    - To Jesús Rascón for his amazing work on p5's saveGif function\n    - P5JS for being such a cool library",
