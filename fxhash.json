            "description": "\"Slice of Life\" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

In this menu you will see controls to capture a screenshot, adjust resolution, and adjust the camera, along with several other controls.\n\nWhen the \"optimized render\" option is checked, the page will compute an acceleration structure before rendering to allow the piece to converge much faster. With this option checked, the piece may need to process for up to a minute before rendering begins, but subsequently the rendering will proceed much more quickly than normal. This can be used to generate high-quality captures more quickly than when the option is not checked.\n\nWhen the \"filtering\" option is checked, a noise filter will be applied to the result of the render, reducing the appearance of noise.\n\nThe \"logic multiple\" slider can be used to multiply the amount of rendering work done each frame. Increasing this number may allow the piece to render more quickly, but may also make the page laggy. It is not recommended to increase this number unless you have a powerful GPU.",

It is inspired by the masters of impressionist art and aims to capture the beauty of nature.\n\nEvery leaf, petal, cloud, and sunray are generated from code using simulated brushstrokes. The flowers and trees are suggestive only and do not depict real species.\n\nThere are 8 formal features that have many values in order to generate a wide variety of outputs. The only rare feature is a SkyMode of 'Eclipse' which occurs in 3% of the outputs.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis is a 100% code generated project. Outputs are created at a default resolution of 1500 x 1000.\n\nClick on the output and use these keys to change the resolution or save the output:\n's' - save at current resolution\n\n'2' - change to  3000 x 2000 resolution\n'3' - change to  4500 x 3000 resolution\n...\n'8' - change to 12000 x 8000 resolution\n\nURL Parameters: You can also set the resolution in the url.\nTo change the resolution append &res=2 (or 3-8)\n\nCopyright 2023 Jeff Clark",

            "description": "\"Slice of Life\" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

Attractor is a visualization of community, a central interest bringing people together, pushing past their walls, bad habits, and traumas. The image is meant to be deceiving in its focus on the attractor, where the true focus is on the overlaps and complex defenses we build around ourselves. Those defenses can make us and those connections into more beautiful, ornate structures, or keep us distant from those around us. Sometimes focusing on a shared attractor is the only way we can let down our guard.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a .png\nPress ’t’ to toggle the grain for printing or personal preference\nPress ‘p’ to save a higher quality .png\nCreated with p5.js and chroma.js",

As it usually happens after a few pints of Guinness we started talking. \n\nHe said how he spent his entire working life on an ocean-going ship, was in danger many times due to storms, and how he couldn't wait to retire and firmly set foot on land, finally spending time with his family, especially grandchildren. \n\nAnd that now as an old man, he is happiest on summer evenings, when the full moon lights up everything, he lies out on the grassy part of the beach and looks at the sea through the grass. I asked him why through the grass? He said - \"I can't live without the sea, and looking at it through the grass is solid proof that I'm really on land after so many years, and that I'm not dreaming after all.\" \n\nThis work is a dedication to that old man. I recently found out from my Irish friends that he died few months ago at age of 87. His ashes were scattered on the grassy part of the beach. Now he is forever close to his sea, but still firmly on land, which he has been striving for for years.\n\nSláinte mr. Doyle.\n\nMade in p5.js\nBajiru, November 2022.",
