We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s.

            "description": "Sol is a companion project that complements my recent series, Metamorphosis. Both projects share a common foundation - a cellular automata engine. The state of each cell in a new generation is influenced by its own state as well as those of its neighboring cells from the last generation. The rules guiding these state transitions, however, are dynamic.\n\nSol for me is an experimental plotter project. As a gesture of my gratitude to minters of Metamorphosis, all minters will be on the reserve list for a free piece of Sol. I’ll take a snapshot of Metamorphosis for the reserve list 30 minutes prior to Sol’s launch. For three days (unless all reserve-holders mint sooner), Sol will be only for those on the reserve list and I'll add anyone who purchases Metamorphosis on primary subsequently. After this period, any remaining pieces, along with an additional 50 mints, will be available for public sale.\n\nA Note on the Name: The inspiration behind the name 'Sol' springs from my visits to SF MoMA, where I always find myself in the space dedicated to Sol LeWitt. Through the repetition and variation of a singular concept, LeWitt constructed forms that were striking, often evolving from basic geometric forms into intricate structures. The same is also echoed in the principle of emergence in cellular automata, where complex systems arise from the interactions of simple components governed by rules. This series, Sol, is a homage to LeWitt's ingenuity in favoring dispassionate geometric forms over the emotionally-infused abstract art styles.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete svg file for plotting. To download three separate svg files with individual colors for plotting press 1,2 & 3. Running an optimization tool can help decrease the plotting time.\n\nPixel Love!\n",

This figurative artwork is entirely generated through code, employing simple strokes and circular arcs. It may exhibit various inks, papers, and shapes.\n\nTo redeem the NFT, simply send an email directly to greweb@protonmail.com to request a physical plot from @greweb. The NFT serves as the key to obtaining a physically plottable art piece. It exports an SVG file that can be used for plotting with pens. Plotter artists have the freedom to utilize their own materials and ship the completed artwork to collectors, provided they possess the NFT at the time of the request. To obtain the .SVG file, simply drag and drop it into a folder or right-click and save.\n\nFor those interested in the technical details, this work was created using WebGL + Rust + WASM and is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.

            "description": "‘Impressions of Order’ is a collection of 300 generative compositions. \n\nInspired by 90s ROM cartridges, server farms and future cityscapes this project explores perception and documentation of ‘order’ within complex systems. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis artwork is best enjoyed in high-resolution so that the subtle layering, colour shifts, variation in hard and soft edges, faint impressions of construction, and the various low-probability glitchy events can be fully appreciated. \n\nBy default, the artwork will load in 2K resolution (1400 x 2000 px). It is recommended that you view the work in 4K or 6K to appreciate the finer details. \n\nThe keyboard buttons: “2”, “4”, and “6” can be pressed to change the resolution to 2K, 4K and 6K resolution accordingly. \n\nTo download an image at its current resolution, press the keyboard button “S”.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtwork created with p5.js\n\n@nbswwit\nSept 2022\n",

It starts with triangles and lines and results in a diverse array of formations.\n\nIn 'Apertum', you will find a series of transformations and reshuffles, as well as a vibrant mix of textures and patterns. These interactions give rise to intricate compositions that I hope you'll enjoy discovering.\n\n'Apertum' is both a thank you to those who have supported my work so far and an invitation to those new to my creations. I invite you to step into the world of 'Apertum', to discover its interplay of shapes, colors, and textures.\n\nPress [s] to save a .png file of the artwork. Made with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023",

Then, inevitably, there is change: an anomaly, a nudge that turns into a catalyst for widespread change.The momentum cannot be stopped.\n\nBrief cycles build upon themselves, iterating and breaking into something new with each turn. Now, looking back, the accumulation of small divergences look like a leap, with trails of evolutionary decline casting tall shadows on the patterns that bore them.\n\nThe beauty of what this entropy creates, rises beyond chaos. It represents the past, and signals the future, and suddenly looks like a wild take on Order itself – the true DisOrder of life.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nFEATURES :\n21 Features implemented including colors, styles, technical parameters...\n\nINTERACTIVITY :\nPress ‘h’ in live mode for a list of options.\nPress 's' to save an image of the output at the current resolution\nPress ‘1’-’9’ to increase resolution\n...\n\nLICENSE\nCopyright (c) 2022 TidallyDisruptedStar @TidallyD.\nCreative contributions from Tender @tender_art\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, see LICENSE.txt for more information.",

            "description": "Each NFT is a recipe to a physical postcard format (A6 size) and utilizes the Redeemables feature of fxhash, allowing owners to unlock a physical plot directly from the artist @greweb. This figurative artwork is entirely generated through code, employing simple strokes and circular arcs. It may exhibit various inks, papers, and shapes.\n\nTo redeem the NFT, simply send an email directly to greweb@protonmail.com to request a physical plot from @greweb. The NFT serves as the key to obtaining a physically plottable art piece. It exports an SVG file that can be used for plotting with pens. Plotter artists have the freedom to utilize their own materials and ship the completed artwork to collectors, provided they possess the NFT at the time of the request. To obtain the .SVG file, simply drag and drop it into a folder or right-click and save.\n\nFor those interested in the technical details, this work was created using WebGL + Rust + WASM and is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.

            "description": "“In Due Time” is a collaborative generative collection between artists Melissa Wiederrecht and Amber Vittoria. Inspired by Wiederrecht’s mastery of line and Vittoria’s notable palette, this 1/1/250 series captures the present moment. It serves as a reminder that we are more similar than we are different, leveraging homogeneous shapes to create distinctive compositions.\n\nVittoria’s poem for the collection:\n\n“In Due Time”\nWe will all become\nParticles dancing\nAcross the skyline.\n\nThe artwork listed is indeed authentic, created by, and copyright to artists Melissa Wiederrecht and Amber Vittoria; the purchase of this NFT is a purchase of the asset, not of the copyright.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTo save a high-resolution image for printing, click “open” under the image on the page for your token, and then hit:\n\nDigits “1” through “9” to get an image that is 1000 through 9000px tall.  This may take a while, depending on the size and your computer, so please be patient.",

            "description": "\"Landscape painting is the contemplation of the earth's features made visible to us in their most perfect moments. It is the record of nature's beauty, which often appears like a momentary revelation; and its effect is to show us how much beauty is around us that we never attend to, and by whose presence we are cheered and elevated in unobserved and unsuspected hours of depression or anxiety.”\nJohn Ruskin\n\n In this collection, I aimed to design the essence of my utopia. Instead of my usual interactive and animated designs, I created a drawing that gives the impression of lithographic printing on 2D black paper, where textures remain static. I wanted the nature objects to have a slightly dark, somewhat Fauvist style. I sought a balance between their depressive nature and the hopeful tranquility of natural light sources, which evoked the feeling I was searching for.\n\n*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as png.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.\n\n“Stratification of the Orthogonal”\n“Agora of Timeless”\n“Surely, There is an Exit”\n\nEveryone who owns the above collections is entitled to a free mint right in this collection. It will be open for a few days specifically for you.\n\nThe remaining supply will be reopened as a paid mint for everyone at a later time. !",

It starts with triangles and lines and results in a diverse array of formations.\n\nIn 'Apertum', you will find a series of transformations and reshuffles, as well as a vibrant mix of textures and patterns. These interactions give rise to intricate compositions that I hope you'll enjoy discovering.\n\n'Apertum' is both a thank you to those who have supported my work so far and an invitation to those new to my creations. I invite you to step into the world of 'Apertum', to discover its interplay of shapes, colors, and textures.\n\nPress [s] to save a .png file of the artwork. Made with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023",
