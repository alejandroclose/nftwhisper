            "description": "Benjamin Franklin famously remarked that in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. We have never quite managed to disprove him on the latter.\n\nAt its core, death carries a straightforward definition: the complete cessation of life processes, an inevitable fate for all living organisms. While we grasp the technical definition, no one possesses the faintest notion of what occurs to an individual after they pass away.\n\nPersonally, I've always been fascinated by the idea of death. Since I was a child, I've found myself empathizing with the suffering of others and who I am today has been shaped by the losses I've experienced in my life.\n\nTo bring this project to life I gathered my thoughts and memories and I coded nightly to visually represent the felt experience of the mystery of death, intentionally using a single line to symbolize life's continuity, from start to finish.\n\nAs the project progressed, I realized the multitude of perspectives surrounding the subject. From losing a loved one to facing our own demise, from being on death row to dying while saving someone else. Whether dying young or after a long, fulfilling life. The pain of losing a child, the weight of taking another's life, the grief of losing a pet, or even the simple act of killing a mosquito—what lies beyond? How long can an object hold a memory? Can it transcend the rituals of ceremony, the solemnity of cemeteries, the grandeur of mausoleums?\n\nI invited eight artist friends to participate in this project by contributing a short phrase, or poem capturing a facet of their feelings about death. I then visually riffed on each submission.\nThere are a total of 16 different profiles, each appearing 5 times but never identical. Each output will enable its owner to redeem a physical plot at an additional cost. This means there could be a maximum of 5 signed and numbered plots for each profile in existence, all unique.\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude to Atelier Art for organizing the Visual Poetry exhibition and assisting me every step of the way, both in helping me articulate what I truly wanted to convey and in executing the concept effectively. In the end, the beauty of an art practice truly lies in the human connections it fosters.\n\nA special thanks goes to my fellow artists who participated in enriching this journey:\n\nÆther               @aethersovereign\nAlessandro Fiore    @whitekross\nHarvey McFly        @HarveyMcFly\nPaul Prudence       @MrPrudence\nPureSpider          @PureSpider\nQUBYT               @qUBYt2\nsantiago            @neymrqz\nSh!g                @shig_nft\n\n--------------------------------------\n- Press 1,2,3 or 4 to re-render the artwork at progressively higher resolution\n- Press S to save a PNG image of the artwork\n- Click and drag over the image to adjust the drawing speed of the line\n- Double-click on the image to restart the drawing process from the beginning\n--------------------------------------\nDedicated to my great friend Vale, who knows when to tell me to shut the fuck up.",

            "description": "Benjamin Franklin famously remarked that in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. We have never quite managed to disprove him on the latter.\n\nAt its core, death carries a straightforward definition: the complete cessation of life processes, an inevitable fate for all living organisms. While we grasp the technical definition, no one possesses the faintest notion of what occurs to an individual after they pass away.\n\nPersonally, I've always been fascinated by the idea of death. Since I was a child, I've found myself empathizing with the suffering of others and who I am today has been shaped by the losses I've experienced in my life.\n\nTo bring this project to life I gathered my thoughts and memories and I coded nightly to visually represent the felt experience of the mystery of death, intentionally using a single line to symbolize life's continuity, from start to finish.\n\nAs the project progressed, I realized the multitude of perspectives surrounding the subject. From losing a loved one to facing our own demise, from being on death row to dying while saving someone else. Whether dying young or after a long, fulfilling life. The pain of losing a child, the weight of taking another's life, the grief of losing a pet, or even the simple act of killing a mosquito—what lies beyond? How long can an object hold a memory? Can it transcend the rituals of ceremony, the solemnity of cemeteries, the grandeur of mausoleums?\n\nI invited eight artist friends to participate in this project by contributing a short phrase, or poem capturing a facet of their feelings about death. I then visually riffed on each submission.\nThere are a total of 16 different profiles, each appearing 5 times but never identical. Each output will enable its owner to redeem a physical plot at an additional cost. This means there could be a maximum of 5 signed and numbered plots for each profile in existence, all unique.\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude to Atelier Art for organizing the Visual Poetry exhibition and assisting me every step of the way, both in helping me articulate what I truly wanted to convey and in executing the concept effectively. In the end, the beauty of an art practice truly lies in the human connections it fosters.\n\nA special thanks goes to my fellow artists who participated in enriching this journey:\n\nÆther               @aethersovereign\nAlessandro Fiore    @whitekross\nHarvey McFly        @HarveyMcFly\nPaul Prudence       @MrPrudence\nPureSpider          @PureSpider\nQUBYT               @qUBYt2\nsantiago            @neymrqz\nSh!g                @shig_nft\n\n--------------------------------------\n- Press 1,2,3 or 4 to re-render the artwork at progressively higher resolution\n- Press S to save a PNG image of the artwork\n- Click and drag over the image to adjust the drawing speed of the line\n- Double-click on the image to restart the drawing process from the beginning\n--------------------------------------\nDedicated to my great friend Vale, who knows when to tell me to shut the fuck up.",

            "description": "Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project. \n\nFile Size: 5100 x 6600\nPress ’s’ to save the image as a .jpg\nPress ‘p’ to save the images as a .png\n\n//= Tiller, 2024\n",

            "description": "Benjamin Franklin famously remarked that in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. We have never quite managed to disprove him on the latter.\n\nAt its core, death carries a straightforward definition: the complete cessation of life processes, an inevitable fate for all living organisms. While we grasp the technical definition, no one possesses the faintest notion of what occurs to an individual after they pass away.\n\nPersonally, I've always been fascinated by the idea of death. Since I was a child, I've found myself empathizing with the suffering of others and who I am today has been shaped by the losses I've experienced in my life.\n\nTo bring this project to life I gathered my thoughts and memories and I coded nightly to visually represent the felt experience of the mystery of death, intentionally using a single line to symbolize life's continuity, from start to finish.\n\nAs the project progressed, I realized the multitude of perspectives surrounding the subject. From losing a loved one to facing our own demise, from being on death row to dying while saving someone else. Whether dying young or after a long, fulfilling life. The pain of losing a child, the weight of taking another's life, the grief of losing a pet, or even the simple act of killing a mosquito—what lies beyond? How long can an object hold a memory? Can it transcend the rituals of ceremony, the solemnity of cemeteries, the grandeur of mausoleums?\n\nI invited eight artist friends to participate in this project by contributing a short phrase, or poem capturing a facet of their feelings about death. I then visually riffed on each submission.\nThere are a total of 16 different profiles, each appearing 5 times but never identical. Each output will enable its owner to redeem a physical plot at an additional cost. This means there could be a maximum of 5 signed and numbered plots for each profile in existence, all unique.\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude to Atelier Art for organizing the Visual Poetry exhibition and assisting me every step of the way, both in helping me articulate what I truly wanted to convey and in executing the concept effectively. In the end, the beauty of an art practice truly lies in the human connections it fosters.\n\nA special thanks goes to my fellow artists who participated in enriching this journey:\n\nÆther               @aethersovereign\nAlessandro Fiore    @whitekross\nHarvey McFly        @HarveyMcFly\nPaul Prudence       @MrPrudence\nPureSpider          @PureSpider\nQUBYT               @qUBYt2\nsantiago            @neymrqz\nSh!g                @shig_nft\n\n--------------------------------------\n- Press 1,2,3 or 4 to re-render the artwork at progressively higher resolution\n- Press S to save a PNG image of the artwork\n- Click and drag over the image to adjust the drawing speed of the line\n- Double-click on the image to restart the drawing process from the beginning\n--------------------------------------\nDedicated to my great friend Vale, who knows when to tell me to shut the fuck up.",

            "description": "Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project. \n\nFile Size: 5100 x 6600\nPress ’s’ to save the image as a .jpg\nPress ‘p’ to save the images as a .png\n\n//= Tiller, 2024\n",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution. I tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge / Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iPhone, but please make sure it works on your device before minting.\n\n-----\n\nPossible features:\n\ncolor scheme: cairngorm, alborz, bardenas, atlas, bieszczady, watkins\n\nproportions: square, wide, standard, narrow\n\nframe: none, vignette, bright, dark, bright with vignette, dark with vignette\n\nvisitors: tourists, tourists and birds, solitary flock of birds, only light\n",

Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",
