            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch E. Rebuilding after the disruption of Sketch D. Color palettes from A-D remain and more palettes are introduced based on Werner's Nomenclature of Colors, first published in 1814, which served as a classification guide for natural colors before photography became commonplace and used by Charles Darwin during voyages on the HMS Beagle. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.\n\nPress the spacebar to see the framework and press the left/right arrow keys to construct and deconstruct.",

Each artist has 5 Artworks in this collection, which have been randomly combined with Borders that I designed (Morteza Yousefi, idea owner and art director)\n\nThis combination has got a beautiful effect in a random way, and besides that, it makes this collection very valuable because of the reputation and Ideas of the 20 artists.\n\nThe number of Traits in this collection is 5 (137 layers) and it has the ability to make 930,240 NFTs.\n\nTo create balance, these NFTs are randomly minted, and this is a chance for everyone to get a rare version. So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\n\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\n🟧🟦\n🟧🟧\n\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nMade in 2022\n\nDesigned by: \n@morteza_yousefy\n@ardavan_\n@happyfamily1985\n@Raze_Slb\n@Didoxme\n@mo0n_zi\n@mahdirezafathi\n@HrishNft\n@HeleDesignnft\n@SebastianVamp21\n@farahmand1989\n@Samaneh_syd\n@ma_khalaji\n@negar_khozhandi\n@lvcteam8\n@Elid_33\n@OmidMahdavi7\n@ehsan_special\n@OmidiNariman\n@ARTsnakeNFT\n\n",

            "description": "Morixels Mega Colab is the first and one of the biggest Collaborations that happen on the FXHash  and also in Morixels Land.\n\nIn this Collaboration, 19 artists have designed their artwork as pixel art. Each artist has 5 Artworks in this collection, which have been randomly combined with Borders that I designed (Morteza Yousefi, idea owner and art director)\n\nThis combination has got a beautiful effect in a random way, and besides that, it makes this collection very valuable because of the reputation and Ideas of the 20 artists.\n\nThe number of Traits in this collection is 5 (137 layers) and it has the ability to make 930,240 NFTs.\n\nTo create balance, these NFTs are randomly minted, and this is a chance for everyone to get a rare version. So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\n\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\n🟧🟦\n🟧🟧\n\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nMade in 2022\n\nDesigned by: \n@morteza_yousefy\n@ardavan_\n@happyfamily1985\n@Raze_Slb\n@Didoxme\n@mo0n_zi\n@mahdirezafathi\n@HrishNft\n@HeleDesignnft\n@SebastianVamp21\n@farahmand1989\n@Samaneh_syd\n@ma_khalaji\n@negar_khozhandi\n@lvcteam8\n@Elid_33\n@OmidMahdavi7\n@ehsan_special\n@OmidiNariman\n@ARTsnakeNFT\n\n",

Each artist has 5 Artworks in this collection, which have been randomly combined with Borders that I designed (Morteza Yousefi, idea owner and art director)\n\nThis combination has got a beautiful effect in a random way, and besides that, it makes this collection very valuable because of the reputation and Ideas of the 20 artists.\n\nThe number of Traits in this collection is 5 (137 layers) and it has the ability to make 930,240 NFTs.\n\nTo create balance, these NFTs are randomly minted, and this is a chance for everyone to get a rare version. So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\n\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\n🟧🟦\n🟧🟧\n\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nMade in 2022\n\nDesigned by: \n@morteza_yousefy\n@ardavan_\n@happyfamily1985\n@Raze_Slb\n@Didoxme\n@mo0n_zi\n@mahdirezafathi\n@HrishNft\n@HeleDesignnft\n@SebastianVamp21\n@farahmand1989\n@Samaneh_syd\n@ma_khalaji\n@negar_khozhandi\n@lvcteam8\n@Elid_33\n@OmidMahdavi7\n@ehsan_special\n@OmidiNariman\n@ARTsnakeNFT\n\n",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch E. Rebuilding after the disruption of Sketch D. Color palettes from A-D remain and more palettes are introduced based on Werner's Nomenclature of Colors, first published in 1814, which served as a classification guide for natural colors before photography became commonplace and used by Charles Darwin during voyages on the HMS Beagle. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.\n\nPress the spacebar to see the framework and press the left/right arrow keys to construct and deconstruct.",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch D (Disruption). The grid is broken. The color palette from Sketches A, B, and C remains. Most outputs are simply single colors or black and white. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.\n\nPress the spacebar to see the unDisturbed structure.",
