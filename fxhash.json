            "description": "\"tratti\" is an Italian word that has many different meanings. When we started working on this piece, we wanted to create something that combines our traits (\"tratti\" in Italian).\nWe had this urge to channel the turbulent times we're living in now into this artwork using just lines (\"tratti\" in Italian).\n\nWe don't know what to do now, we're here, and that's all that matters. We're here for our families, our friends, and our community. Like everything in life, there are joyful times and challenging times. We must accept happiness as something that is not constant but that we feel at times (a \"tratti\" in Italian).\n\nWith \"tratti\", we want to send a message to every disheartened human being: \"Stay strong and never let anyone or anything crush the hope in you. Joyful times are around the corner\".\n\n---- \n\n© 2022 — Alessandro Fiore x Emanuele Pasin\nLICENSE.md for detailed licensing info",

It has enmity toward snakes, and its natural habitat is a place with plenty of water. Its feathers are said to be copper-colored, and though it was initially described as a dog-bird, it was later shown with either the head of a man or a dog.\n\nIranian legends consider the bird so old that it had seen the world's destruction three times over. The Simurgh learned so much by living so long that it is thought to possess the knowledge of all the ages. In one legend, the Simurgh was said to live 1,700 years before plunging itself into flames (much like the phoenix).\nThe Simurgh was considered to purify the land and waters and bestow fertility. The creature represented the union between the Earth and the sky, serving as a mediator and messenger between the two. The Simurgh roosted in Gaokerena, the Hōm (Avestan: Haoma) Tree of Life, stands in the middle of the world sea (Vourukasha). \nSimorgh was the inspiration for making this work.\nEverything is generated by code written in P5js.",

            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

If we were Will’s baby, we’d be sitting up and prepping to crawl — the literal baby steps that precede an entire lifetime of movement. \n\nPlay is another integral part of our development. Play teaches us to connect, laugh, share, love, and learn. It helps form our earliest friendships that mold us into who we are destined to become. Over the last six months we have had the immense pleasure of forming new relationships with some of the amazing artists that comprise of the fxhash community. \n\nIt is the love and support of new friends Laurent Houdard, Ada Ada Ada, elsif, and Camille Roux that made our first (official) collaboration possible. Thank you so much for the idea, the vision, the art, the time, and the wrangling to make this possible. \n\nEach letter is imbued with the unique style of an artist, based on a framework created by Laurent. There is a small chance of receiving a piece with two of the same style, with the rarest possibility of receiving one with all four quadrants the same. \n\nCollect with love and the knowledge that your support means the world to us. Thank you for listening every week, and for the messages and stories that you share with us. We can’t wait to continue to grow.\n\nThank you so much again to Laurent, Ada, elsif, and Camille. This is what community is.",

They are an attempt to capture a specific, singular handwriting, and evolve it using code. \n• See the original, 2014 handmade version here - https://pobbles.tez.page..\n• Alternative titles considered include Peggles™, Plops™, Blobbies™, Floofs™, Flintstones™, Lardies™, Plumps™, Fats™ and Wet-Ones™. \n• The pobbles are written entirely in paper.js and p5.js. \n• The pobbles are an effort to take generative art into the realm of the cute. \n• They work well with toddlers.\n\n🖨️ Collectors minting at the first auction tier receive a hand-crafted riso print of their pobble. Color variation between the file and the print will apply. 🖨️",

            "description": "Julia's Magical Bulbs are 3D dimensional fractals, based on the Julia Sets of the Mandelbulb fractal.\n\nThe token is interactive, use your mouse-wheel to zoom-in and see all the little details. You will find a menu in the lower-right corner which allows you to play with the iterations and camera position. You can also render high-resolution images here.\n\nA little bit of magic happens when you select low iteration values, perhaps your token will even default to this. \n\nTechnical:\n\nNot all browsers support multi-threaded modules, the fallback mode is quite slow. Try Chrome if your browser is not supported.\n\nCalculated in full 64-bit on the CPU (not the GPU) for more accurate and detailed images.\n",
