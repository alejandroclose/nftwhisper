            "description": "Shattered Obelisks began as a work that is dedicated to my habit of mindlessly drawing on paper when I am stressed, depressed or immersed in difficult thoughts.\n\nLike a patient undergoing psychotherapy and piecing together the causes of unconscious fears and anxieties, I and my artwork have assembled ourselves into something shaped, found order in the chaos and separated it from the external noise.\n\nIt took 3 months of continuous, obsessive work. I have developed a huge library, designed for hand-like drawing. The functionality of this library is four times larger than what is shown in this drop.\n\nI plan to put this library out into the public domain when I deem it complete, and hope that it will help someone express themselves through the creative process as much as it helped for me.\n\nIn case you've encountered a problem with inverted colours, try changing browser or disabling extensions. This problem only occurred once during testing on a massive amount of devices and was resolved by disabling extensions.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES BLOCK:\n\nNOTE 1: This artwork should be viewed at a browser scale of 100%. Reducing the scale will increase the amount of detail, but may unpredictably affect the preservation of the location of secondary objects.\n\nNOTE 2: This work can be printed on a plotter. Click S for saving it in .SVG.\nDetailed instructions and answers to possible questions can be found in the console output of the code.\n\nNOTE 3: This drop is the first one from the series of 3. It will be used as AL ticket in next drops of this series.\n\n@abakshonokoleg\n01.08.2022\nTech: P5.JS\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)",

Inspired by the early pioneering work of the concrete poets such as Dom Sylvester Houédard, Ian Hamilton Finley and Steve McCaffe, the project is a play with letters, words and graphic form in the computational and generative space.\n\nEach iteration gives you the possibility to discover a variety of visual form through exploring the system. Please explore your iteration with the key interactions below. It is hoped that you give the time to explore and observe. If you don't, you may end up with just a blank canvas. \n\nThank you for collecting. \n\nKey Interactions\n\n‘a’ activates forward motion on/off\n‘b’ activates backward motion on/off\n‘r’ rotates grid 45° [ rotates on key pressed]\n‘f’ rotates the grid freely [ stops on key release ]\n‘p’ switches grid scale on/off [ this can be CPU heavy on older machines ] \n‘g’ extra glyphs on/off\n‘q’ return to the initial state \n\n\nProgram written by Mark Webster\nFont is copyright ©simonrenaud\n\nareafour.xyz\n@motiondesign_01",

Full description of the artwork+instructions here: https://www.iillucid.com/aprendizajes/\n\nThe artwork allows the user to:\n\n* Change resolution: press 'd' followed by any number from 1 to 9 to add that amount to the pixel density. If you get a black screen you have surpassed what your graphics card can handle: press d + 0 to reset the pixel density. You can fine tune pressing d followed by + or - (+/- 0.5).\n* Save image: press 's' to save the current image as png. For a higher resolution png, 1st increase the resolution using 'd' and then save the image with 's'.\n* Tune image parameters: press 'z' (brightness), 'x' (contrast), 'g' (gamma), 'b' (blur) followed by + or - to adjust. Toggle tuning with 'a'. Press 'n' then + or - to adjust amount of noise.\n* Redraw: 'r' (changes how lines are drawn)\n\nIt is recommended to read the full instructions on the article.",

            "description": "Shattered Obelisks began as a work that is dedicated to my habit of mindlessly drawing on paper when I am stressed, depressed or immersed in difficult thoughts.\n\nLike a patient undergoing psychotherapy and piecing together the causes of unconscious fears and anxieties, I and my artwork have assembled ourselves into something shaped, found order in the chaos and separated it from the external noise.\n\nIt took 3 months of continuous, obsessive work. I have developed a huge library, designed for hand-like drawing. The functionality of this library is four times larger than what is shown in this drop.\n\nI plan to put this library out into the public domain when I deem it complete, and hope that it will help someone express themselves through the creative process as much as it helped for me.\n\nIn case you've encountered a problem with inverted colours, try changing browser or disabling extensions. This problem only occurred once during testing on a massive amount of devices and was resolved by disabling extensions.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES BLOCK:\n\nNOTE 1: This artwork should be viewed at a browser scale of 100%. Reducing the scale will increase the amount of detail, but may unpredictably affect the preservation of the location of secondary objects.\n\nNOTE 2: This work can be printed on a plotter. Click S for saving it in .SVG.\nDetailed instructions and answers to possible questions can be found in the console output of the code.\n\nNOTE 3: This drop is the first one from the series of 3. It will be used as AL ticket in next drops of this series.\n\n@abakshonokoleg\n01.08.2022\nTech: P5.JS\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)",

Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

            "description": "\"AN2: Recuerdos\" is an abstract collection that is the direct sequel to Artificialmente Natural. Recuerdos are memories in Spanish, and with this collection, I tried to evoke specifically that, a memory. There are many times throughout our life that our memory changes and grow. Sometimes we even alter memories unconsciously, mixing them up between other memories and even fantasy or dreams (ever had a Deja Vu?), creating a new memory solely based on an idea of the past and what it was. We live in a world of perceptions, and that is exactly what our memory is, a combination of perceptions that became ideas, made up of other older ideas and new ones, to then get stored inside our brain as new memories.\n\nNow, you may ask, cool story, but what does it have to do with the collection? Well, through your memories, experiences, and perceptions, you're going to analyze the piece. You may think you see an abstract ocean in the background, or a sky, or waves, or auras. You may feel that the art piece sometimes looks decayed, splattered with paint, or just splattered with dirty noise. The truth is that through your memory, you're going to try to make sense of it no matter if you like what you're seeing or not, and that's the sole idea of everything. Interpreting through our experiences is how we calm the tension we feel from the unknown. You can't make a comparison or an interpretation if you haven't seen or experienced something that laid an idea inside your brain, becoming multiple other ideas through plasticity and neural connectivity, always trying to make sense of everything. That's why your \"recuerdos\" is the key to the way you interpret life and live it, both unconsciously and consciously. \n\nFor me, this collection consciously reminds me of my teenage years. A little chaotic at times, with some beautiful moments of self-discovery. Mistakes were made, love was found and lost, and everything was pretty colorful and new. Unconsciously, I don't know, that's the beauty of the unknown. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTICE\n\nAllow list will be deleted 48 hours after the collections goes live.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nFYI\n\nLoading of the art goes through 3 stages in order.

            "description": "Shattered Obelisks began as a work that is dedicated to my habit of mindlessly drawing on paper when I am stressed, depressed or immersed in difficult thoughts.\n\nLike a patient undergoing psychotherapy and piecing together the causes of unconscious fears and anxieties, I and my artwork have assembled ourselves into something shaped, found order in the chaos and separated it from the external noise.\n\nIt took 3 months of continuous, obsessive work. I have developed a huge library, designed for hand-like drawing. The functionality of this library is four times larger than what is shown in this drop.\n\nI plan to put this library out into the public domain when I deem it complete, and hope that it will help someone express themselves through the creative process as much as it helped for me.\n\nIn case you've encountered a problem with inverted colours, try changing browser or disabling extensions. This problem only occurred once during testing on a massive amount of devices and was resolved by disabling extensions.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES BLOCK:\n\nNOTE 1: This artwork should be viewed at a browser scale of 100%. Reducing the scale will increase the amount of detail, but may unpredictably affect the preservation of the location of secondary objects.\n\nNOTE 2: This work can be printed on a plotter. Click S for saving it in .SVG.\nDetailed instructions and answers to possible questions can be found in the console output of the code.\n\nNOTE 3: This drop is the first one from the series of 3. It will be used as AL ticket in next drops of this series.\n\n@abakshonokoleg\n01.08.2022\nTech: P5.JS\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)",

            "description": "\"AN2: Recuerdos\" is an abstract collection that is the direct sequel to Artificialmente Natural. Recuerdos are memories in Spanish, and with this collection, I tried to evoke specifically that, a memory. There are many times throughout our life that our memory changes and grow. Sometimes we even alter memories unconsciously, mixing them up between other memories and even fantasy or dreams (ever had a Deja Vu?), creating a new memory solely based on an idea of the past and what it was. We live in a world of perceptions, and that is exactly what our memory is, a combination of perceptions that became ideas, made up of other older ideas and new ones, to then get stored inside our brain as new memories.\n\nNow, you may ask, cool story, but what does it have to do with the collection? Well, through your memories, experiences, and perceptions, you're going to analyze the piece. You may think you see an abstract ocean in the background, or a sky, or waves, or auras. You may feel that the art piece sometimes looks decayed, splattered with paint, or just splattered with dirty noise. The truth is that through your memory, you're going to try to make sense of it no matter if you like what you're seeing or not, and that's the sole idea of everything. Interpreting through our experiences is how we calm the tension we feel from the unknown. You can't make a comparison or an interpretation if you haven't seen or experienced something that laid an idea inside your brain, becoming multiple other ideas through plasticity and neural connectivity, always trying to make sense of everything. That's why your \"recuerdos\" is the key to the way you interpret life and live it, both unconsciously and consciously. \n\nFor me, this collection consciously reminds me of my teenage years. A little chaotic at times, with some beautiful moments of self-discovery. Mistakes were made, love was found and lost, and everything was pretty colorful and new. Unconsciously, I don't know, that's the beauty of the unknown. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTICE\n\nAllow list will be deleted 48 hours after the collections goes live.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nFYI\n\nLoading of the art goes through 3 stages in order. It may take between 30 seconds to 40 seconds to finalize.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPress [S] to save as PNG",
