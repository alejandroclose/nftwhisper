            "description": "At length, I summoned the courage to approach.\n\n-\n\nI was worn. Months of aimless wandering have culminated in this series; a meditation on my struggles to find a direction in my life and with my art.\n\nAt times paralyzed by too many possibilities, and at other times completely void of ideas. I was lost in the depths of my thinking, overwhelmed by indecision and doubt.\n\nGenerative works are a form of process art, yet along the way I‚Äôd forgotten to ‚Äútrust the process‚Äù. It was time to cede control and let each line of code light the way.\n\n-\n\nThis project paints on a 2D canvas, pixel by pixel. I used a custom projection that blends isometric and perspective techniques, to create an uncanny viewpoint between the two. Objects are randomly generated, then an algorithm applies color mixing and position displacement to each pixel as it‚Äôs rendered.\n\nBy default the canvas has 2k pixels on its longest edge. You can change this in live view by pressing any number from 1-9. For example, pressing ‚Äò4‚Äô would render it with 4k pixels along the longest edge. I recommend ‚Äò4‚Äô, but this can take up to a few minutes to render.\n\nPress ‚Äòs‚Äô to save the rendered image.",

            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

            "description": "The Enfantines¬†are three sets of beginner piano pieces by¬†Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children‚Äôs pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n‚ÄúEnfantines II. Enfantillages Pittoresques‚Äù is the second of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. ‚ÄúEnfantillages Pittoresques‚Äù experiments with predefined plots, colour blending, webgl shaders, and generative music; all with a fresh, childish style. This algorithm has been trained to draw basic shapes in accordance to Satie‚Äôs lyrics. However, it uses them in unusual ways and creates what looks like fantastic creatures, microscopic beings, or, to follow Corneille, Constant, and Appel: \"human animals\".\n\n‚ÄúIt took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child‚Äù Attributed to Picasso (falsely, probably)\n\nWith two modes that won‚Äôt produce the same outputs, ‚ÄúEnfantines‚Äù are best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie‚Äôs piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, these have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\nPress M or Double Tap (mobile) for AUDIO mode\nWait for SILENT mode\nPress I for Trait Info (desktop)\nPress 1 for Canvas Save (desktop)\n\nIntroduce ‚Äú?pixelDensity=171‚Äù after URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\nIntroduce ‚Äú?pixelDensity=X‚Äù for HQ renders (standard is 2, and 8 produces 400ppi 40x44cm prints).\n\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe ‚ÄúEnfantines‚Äù are educational algorithms. The code has been compressed and minified for a performance boost, but can be read fully in GitHub: https://github.com/ratchitect/\n\n\n# PERFORMANCE\nBetter experienced with Chrome.",

I was lost in the depths of my thinking, overwhelmed by indecision and doubt.\n\nGenerative works are a form of process art, yet along the way I‚Äôd forgotten to ‚Äútrust the process‚Äù. It was time to cede control and let each line of code light the way.\n\n-\n\nThis project paints on a 2D canvas, pixel by pixel. I used a custom projection that blends isometric and perspective techniques, to create an uncanny viewpoint between the two. Objects are randomly generated, then an algorithm applies color mixing and position displacement to each pixel as it‚Äôs rendered.\n\nBy default the canvas has 2k pixels on its longest edge. You can change this in live view by pressing any number from 1-9. For example, pressing ‚Äò4‚Äô would render it with 4k pixels along the longest edge.

            "description": "\"Before the Storm\" captures a fleeting moment of calmness amidst an impending tempest. Heavy clouds loom overhead, suffusing the air with palpable moisture and an alluring aroma. Majestic evergreens stand tall and proud, bravely facing the ominous yet strangely inviting sky. The air crackles with electrifying energy, foreshadowing the raw power of nature about to be unleashed. In this fleeting moment, one cannot help but be mesmerized by the sublime forces at play, but beware, the calm will not last forever.\n\nTechnical Note:\nIf you wish to render a high-quality version of your iteration, I strongly recommend increasing the resolution (press \"R\") and setting anti-aliasing to >1 (press \"A\"). However, be aware that it might take longer to compile and may not render at all on older hardware. To save the image, press \"S\".\n\nThe code has been tested on my old MacBook and on various Windows machines. For best results, use a modern Chromium-based browser, and make sure your browser supports WebGL 2.\n\nsuperbialux",

The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms.
