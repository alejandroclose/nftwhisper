            "description": "CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG is an homage to Ohne Titel (1969–1970) by Verena Loewensberg.\n\n2 of 5 in CENTURY-XXX, Series 2\nEdition of 128\n\nCENTURY-XXX is a series of software sketches that pay tribute to artists of the 20th century. Each piece is named after a specific artist and reimagines one of their original works through code, often by adding motion, variation, or interactive elements. These sketches don’t replicate the original artworks but instead extend their core ideas into new forms.\n\nBy “software sketch,” I mean something more informal than a finished artwork. While some of my projects take months or even years to complete, these sketches are created quickly—often in just a few days. They may be lighter in process, but they’re equally important to me. Sketching with code is how I think through ideas and discover new directions for future work.\n\nThe project began with the CENTURY exhibition at DAM Projects in Berlin in fall 2012, where I premiered Network C, Network D, and the first Signal to Noise software piece. Since then, these sketches have inspired more full-scale artworks like METASOTO, METAVASARELY, METAMOLNAR (also known as Hommage à Molnar), including the eponymous CENTURY released through Art Blocks in June 2021.\n\nCENTURY-XXX Series 1 was released from December 2021 to January 2022 in editions of 1,000. The first artwork in Series 2 followed in October 2022, also in an edition of 1,000. The remaining four works in Series 2 are scheduled for release starting in 2025, each in smaller editions of fewer than 128 based on what feels appropriate for the individual piece.\n\nThe long-term vision for CENTURY-XXX is to create 100 software sketches, each one inspired by a different artist and artwork from the 20th century.\n\nSERIES 1\n1.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMETAMALEVICH\n1.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMOLNAR(S)\n1.3 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMORELLET\n1.4 — CENTURY-XXX-METARILEY\n1.5 — CENTURY-XXX-METAKELLY\n\nSERIES 2\n2.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE\n2.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG\n\nMore CENTURY-XXX’s to come…",

            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

With a global tempo typically set in days, we fit all sorts of temporal structures where our joys and fears live and play out over the span of our lives. This series is a metaphorical transposition of the musical counterpoint into a visual space, sometimes with repeating patterns, sometimes with broken structures, sometimes isolated notes / hours / souls.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

It’s less of a technical discussion, and more about the experience of the artist, and how it became linked with the feelings they associate with the art.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nFor higher resolutions, you can append “&density=2” to the url to double the size, “&density=3” to triple, and so on.\n(This is highly recommended.)\n\nTo adjust grain, you can append “&grain=##” to the url. 40 is the default, and 0 will remove it completely.",

            "description": "This project is a cellular automata that simulates falling sand. The falling is deterministic: each sand particle will fall to the same place each time the program is run. Some iterations eventually stop, some continue indefinitely.\n\nThe fun is that the project is implemented on a fragment shader. There is no array of grains of sand. Each pixel decides whether a grain of sand from a neighboring pixel will end up in it or not. This logic required a lot of banging my head against the wall, because the slightest mistake caused sand to disappear into nowhere or appear out of nothing and clutter up the entire space.\n\n0…9 — set speed\nspace — pause\ns — save picture\ndrag over — add more sand\nshift+drag — erase",
