            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

            "description": "Growth patterns, version 2. January 2022\nEdition of 512\n\nGrowth v02 is an generative exploration of patterns in the style of William Morris' iconic wallpaper designs from the 1800s. The code for the Growth series was originally designed to create plausible road networks but has been rewritten to create more organic curved forms. Created with p5js.\n\n'space' to pause the simulation\n'h' to toggle to higher res (increases canvas size but runs slower: great for screengrabs)\n'r' to reset the seed (some features are locked to the original hash)\n's' to save an image to disk\nAll generated patterns are tile-able horizontally and vertically.\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\nThis project relies heavily on randomly generated values. It has been thoroughly tested. However, there is always the chance that the wrong combination of randomness can create less-compelling growth. If you feel you version is not living up to the potential promised with this piece, please email me.",

This is an introspective piece where generative art reflects upon itself, representing a completely new form of generative poetry.\n\n‘inside window’ は、Atelier によってキュレーションされた ‘Visual Poetry’ グループ展の作品のひとつです。これは、コード詩とジェネレーティブアートを融合したものです。この作品を実行すると、実行されているブラウザの window オブジェクトの中からすべての関数をみつけだし、その中からひとつの関数を選んで呼び出します。関数呼び出しによって返ってくるものは、自分自身の奥底に存在するエラーメッセージの言葉です。そこには想像もできない広大な地平が広がっています。これは、ジェネレーティブアートそれ自体が自己をみつめる内省的な作品であり、まったく新しい生成詩です。",

            "description": "Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project. \n\nFile Size: 5100 x 6600\nPress ’s’ to save the image as a .jpg\nPress ‘p’ to save the images as a .png\n\n//= Tiller, 2024\n",

It is an exploration of generative algorithms, an examination of limited perception and the power of suggestion, and intended to evoke a nostalgia for the artistic sensibilities imposed by the hardware limitations of early arcade machines.\n\nFurther write-up:  https://www.davebollinger.us/pixelspaceships\n\nPresented in a form suitable for large-format print if desired.  Each minting provides up to 100 retries via parameters to help obtain a preferred style.  (Though note that some features are quite rare, so a bit of luck may still be involved.)

            "description": "Acequia (“ah-seh-kee-uh”) - a Spanish adaptation of the Arabic word as-sāqiya, meaning “water carrier”. \n\nIn our second collaboration, Rich and Rick are back with our blend of generative code, intricate design, attention to detail, and a splash of charm. \n\n Acequias are traditional irrigation canals used to distribute rainwater and snowmelt along a complex network of narrow channels. They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

            "description": "Benjamin Franklin famously remarked that in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. We have never quite managed to disprove him on the latter.\n\nAt its core, death carries a straightforward definition: the complete cessation of life processes, an inevitable fate for all living organisms. While we grasp the technical definition, no one possesses the faintest notion of what occurs to an individual after they pass away.\n\nPersonally, I've always been fascinated by the idea of death. Since I was a child, I've found myself empathizing with the suffering of others and who I am today has been shaped by the losses I've experienced in my life.\n\nTo bring this project to life I gathered my thoughts and memories and I coded nightly to visually represent the felt experience of the mystery of death, intentionally using a single line to symbolize life's continuity, from start to finish.\n\nAs the project progressed, I realized the multitude of perspectives surrounding the subject. From losing a loved one to facing our own demise, from being on death row to dying while saving someone else. Whether dying young or after a long, fulfilling life. The pain of losing a child, the weight of taking another's life, the grief of losing a pet, or even the simple act of killing a mosquito—what lies beyond? How long can an object hold a memory? Can it transcend the rituals of ceremony, the solemnity of cemeteries, the grandeur of mausoleums?\n\nI invited eight artist friends to participate in this project by contributing a short phrase, or poem capturing a facet of their feelings about death. I then visually riffed on each submission.\nThere are a total of 16 different profiles, each appearing 5 times but never identical. Each output will enable its owner to redeem a physical plot at an additional cost. This means there could be a maximum of 5 signed and numbered plots for each profile in existence, all unique.\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude to Atelier Art for organizing the Visual Poetry exhibition and assisting me every step of the way, both in helping me articulate what I truly wanted to convey and in executing the concept effectively. In the end, the beauty of an art practice truly lies in the human connections it fosters.\n\nA special thanks goes to my fellow artists who participated in enriching this journey:\n\nÆther               @aethersovereign\nAlessandro Fiore    @whitekross\nHarvey McFly        @HarveyMcFly\nPaul Prudence       @MrPrudence\nPureSpider          @PureSpider\nQUBYT               @qUBYt2\nsantiago            @neymrqz\nSh!g                @shig_nft\n\n--------------------------------------\n- Press 1,2,3 or 4 to re-render the artwork at progressively higher resolution\n- Press S to save a PNG image of the artwork\n- Click and drag over the image to adjust the drawing speed of the line\n- Double-click on the image to restart the drawing process from the beginning\n--------------------------------------\nDedicated to my great friend Vale, who knows when to tell me to shut the fuck up.",
