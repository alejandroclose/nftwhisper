            "description": "1) INTRO (MUST READ)\n\"Emotions\" is a unique Animated, watercolor or liquid painting-like abstract generative artwork which incorporates some \"innovative\" or unique techniques and approaches.\n\nIf find the above too selfish or wonder if its worth to buy this sh**t in a relative high price from an unknown \"artist\" please give some time to read the whole description. You will not regret!\n\nI don't like to talk about myself or using marketing expressions, however sometimes have to, in order to clarify some points & spot some important features\n\nAll started as an exercise to shaders on Nov. 2022 and is the completion of this experimentation (rotating colors): twitter.com/Uniray_net/status/1587588272842280961 \n\n\n2) SHORT BIO\nI was always between graphics & programming. Was very good in both areas (as my teachers were saying) & remember me also drawing from childhood \nThe first years i was focusing more in graphics (i was teaching graphics as well) and i was programming graphics for hobby\n\nFrom 2005 & later i started a turn in my career & made programming my profession for the last 13-14 years (developer in some private companies)\nIn 2020 I started again a more serious involvement with graphics without knowing anything about NFTs or WEB3. And from 2021 i started getting more & more involved. Still so many to learn\n\nI am new in gen art, started few months ago with plain javascript.\nStarted learning p5js in Aug. 2002 and shaders in Oct. 2022 & \"Emotions\" is my first \"large\" work. \nAlready published some simpler & old works (eg. 3D) & things i developed as i was learning\n\n3) FEATURES\nI think i am presenting something relatively different with \"Emotions\" & always try to apply one of my favorite motto: \"Lead, don't follow\"\n\nThe general experience in programming & the fact that i had already programmed graphics in conjunction with my love for experimentation & searching behind the things, helped me to incorporate in \"Emotions\" some \"innovative\" i believe features & techniques (it sounds selfish but let me explain)\n\n- First i am \"proud\" of the shader work. I developed completely custom \"advanced\" techniques that discovered after experimentation & some knowledge of course.\n\n- \"Emotions\" includes 51 palettes (with several color each) that have been stored externally (in the application folder) as Adobe \".act\" color table files so that avoiding hard coded (including all palettes in the code) consuming in this way resources eg. memory from user's system. I just load only the one palette i am going to use\n\n- A fast svg Convolution kernel Matrix filter along with a displacement filter used for the texture\n\n- Lastly & minor, you can switch Orientation (Portrait, Landscape, etc) & Resolution with the press of a key (no need to manually add params in the url)\n\nFrom the above the most important part is the webGL shader.\n\n4) CONCLUSION\n\"Emotions\" is an animated watercolor painting-like (or liquid pigments material) abstract \"live\" work, that instead of staying static, starting with an initial state & slowly flowing, changing shapes & colors as sometimes happens with our emotions & feelings which may changed over time. \nColors also represents emotions eg. red is for passion, green is the color of hope, etc \n\nGive some time to observe the progress and liquid feel and motion in shapes and colors.  Relax and look the flow and color diffusion - spread  & the whole \"painting\" to transformed slowly. \n\nKEYS:\n- 1-4: Set resolution from 1x to 4x of the current dimension (slower performance in higher values)\n- T: Texture on/off\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait (default). Aspect ratio 0.75\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape with ratio 4/3\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ between orientations\n\n- Spacebar: animation on/off\n\nMOUSE:\n- Click: animation on/off\n- Move: left - right on canvas (when in animation) to interact\n\n----\nMade with p5js & custom shaders. Pure code. No Images used\n\n© Dec. 2022  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

A NEON style colors, experimental repeated animation with inspiration elements from fireworks, laser and light shows.\n\nTechnically \"Infinity Loop\" is a programmatically generated abstract and geometric \"endless\" animation based on simple geometric shapes, lines and some text elements.\nEach generative token is a variation of a main animation prototype getting its identity of a set of random initial parameters specific to each token, as derived form the seed of the minting transaction hash.\n\nThe animation of each token spans in a period around 20 secs, so some features are not visible from the beginning nor in the (static) preview image. This is a pure algorithmic and randomly-driven process.\n\nTRAITS - FEATURES\nThe main traits are:\n\n- Mask Area: The clipping area (outer shape) of the token ('Rounded Rhombus', 'Circle', 'Rhombus)\n- Animated Shape: The main animated shape ('Circle', 'Box', 'Rectangle', 'Triangle', 'Polygon', 'Mixed')\n- Extra Animation: Some shapes have additional animation ('Yes', 'No')\n- Number of shapes: The number of Animated Shapes\n- Shape Size: 'Large' or 'Small'\n- Radial Distance: The distance of moving from the center of view ('Large', 'Small')\n- Curve Variation: The bezier - curve used (related mainly to orientation) (1 or 2)\n- Secondary Line Type: A Secondary line animated in background ('Horizontal', 'Diagonal 1', 'Diagonal 2', 'Diagonal 3')\n- Initial Hue: A basic color hue (1 to 360 in the HSB color model)\n- Border Color: The outer border color (unlimited values, in HEX format - True colors 16.7 millions colors)\n- Bubbles: Small decorative animated bubbles ('Yes', 'No')\n\nCONTROLS & INTERACTIVITY\nKEYS: \n   \n'1':   Save image (frame) with transparent background  \n'2':   Save image with colored background\n'UP ARROW': Increases the animation Speed (with one press to 150%)\n'DOWN ARROW': Decreases the animation Speed (to 50% of original)\n'R':  Reset speed to 100% (default)\n'SPACEBAR':  Toggle animation (start/stop)\n'H':  Toggle a help screen - dialog\n\nMOUSE:  \nCLICK or DRAG your mouse..\n\n----\nLIBRARY: p5js\n\n\n© 5/2023 (Initial released: 9/2022)  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

            "description": "\"Dissolve\" is an Animated, painting-like abstract generative artwork.\nStarted as an exercise to custom shaders and the final idea early became to generate an image that looks like a painting eg. chalk or spatula like look on canvas, however not a static final image as usual but with some animated elements. Like a \"live\" painting.\n\nFrom technical point of view, in short: there are 2 main different graphic buffers (2D and 3D) to draw some basic-primitive shapes/objects and the final frame is a mixing (or clear) with some pixel manipulation eg. dissolve - noise and other processing performed inside my custom shader.\nThe speed of shaders (power of hardware acceleration - GPU) allows the processing of multiple frames per second thus allowing animated \"painting\" - looking final results.\n\nEnough with the description :)\n\nCONTROLS\n\nKEYS:\n\n1-4: Set resolution from 1x to 4x of the current dimension (possibly slower performance in higher values)\nS: Save a png file with the current resolution\nUP arrow: Increases the animation Speed\nDOWN arrow: Decreases the animation Speed\nR: Reset speed to default\nSPACEBAR: Start/Stop animation\n\nMOUSE:\n\nCLICK: Start/Stop animation\n\n----\nMade with p5js and custom shaders\n\n© Oct. 2022  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

Some extreme sounds (frequency and amplitude) can be generated.\n\n-Supply can be halved/reduced and the price can be doubled if half supply has not been minted (every 24h aprox).\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n-a synthesizer generates the sound and this is represented visually.\n\n-the sitetizer has 3 possible modulations: FM, AM and phaser.\n\n-carrier and modulator canhave 3 different types of wave: sine, square or sawtooth.\n\n-the modulator is an LFO (or noise)\n\n-each piece consists of 8 steps.\n\n-each step has randomly generated synthesizer parameters, visualizations and duration.\n\n-after the first cycle, the parameters of each step can change with higher or lower probability randomly (fxrand).\n\n-that's why in this project there are no defined fxfeatures, since they can change in each cycle. So we get an infinite and unique sequence for each piece.\n\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
