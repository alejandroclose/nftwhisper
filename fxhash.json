            "description": "SCHNEEWALD is the second release in a row of about 12 tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years.\n\nThis project explores an approach to trees with snow using a recursive algorithm and includes Three traits: a density layer for the amount of trees and another layer for the amount snow and a third for how strong the branches bend.\n\nRendering progress indicated on the top left border\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png\n\nArtist notes:\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nI experienced it in all sorts of seasonal change, packed with snow is definitely among the most amazing! \n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: https://e-art.co/project/schneewald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND",

            "description": "Hills of Chaos\n\nThe beauty of chaos is the concept that out of disorder, randomness, and unpredictability, can emerge patterns, complexity, and surprising beauty. Chaos theory suggests that small, seemingly insignificant changes in a complex system can lead to dramatic and unpredictable outcomes.\n\nIn art, the beauty of chaos can be seen in many forms, including abstract expressionism, action painting, and generative art. In abstract expressionism and action painting, artists use techniques that rely on chance, spontaneity, and improvisation to create works that are characterized by an energy and vitality that comes from the unpredictability of the process. These works often have a raw and visceral quality that can be very powerful.\n\nGenerative art is another form of art that often celebrates the beauty of chaos. Generative art is created by using algorithms and programming to generate art that is unpredictable and evolving. The artist sets up a system, but the final outcome is determined by the interaction between the system and the viewer. This creates an artwork that is constantly changing and surprising, with the potential for emergent patterns and unexpected beauty.\n\nIn nature, chaos can also be beautiful. Examples include the patterns of clouds, the fractal branching of trees, or the intricate and seemingly chaotic patterns of the ocean waves. These natural systems are often too complex to fully understand, yet they exhibit a beauty that is undeniable.\n\nIn summary, the beauty of chaos lies in its ability to create unexpected and surprising outcomes, whether in art or in nature. The unpredictability and randomness can create patterns and complexity that can be breathtaking and inspiring.\n\nIn 'Hills of Chaos' are two possible sizes, square and rectangular aspect ratios 5000x5000 and 7500x5000, 20 color palettes, some of them taken from \"Studio Yorktown Color Town Hall\" by \n@StudioYorktown (studioyorktown.github.io/coloryorktownhall)\n\nTo download high-resolution 'PNG' file, open 'LIVE' and press 'S'\n\nFebruary 2023\nMade with p5JS library \n\n\n \n",

            "description": "Hills of Chaos\n\nThe beauty of chaos is the concept that out of disorder, randomness, and unpredictability, can emerge patterns, complexity, and surprising beauty. Chaos theory suggests that small, seemingly insignificant changes in a complex system can lead to dramatic and unpredictable outcomes.\n\nIn art, the beauty of chaos can be seen in many forms, including abstract expressionism, action painting, and generative art. In abstract expressionism and action painting, artists use techniques that rely on chance, spontaneity, and improvisation to create works that are characterized by an energy and vitality that comes from the unpredictability of the process. These works often have a raw and visceral quality that can be very powerful.\n\nGenerative art is another form of art that often celebrates the beauty of chaos. Generative art is created by using algorithms and programming to generate art that is unpredictable and evolving. The artist sets up a system, but the final outcome is determined by the interaction between the system and the viewer. This creates an artwork that is constantly changing and surprising, with the potential for emergent patterns and unexpected beauty.\n\nIn nature, chaos can also be beautiful. Examples include the patterns of clouds, the fractal branching of trees, or the intricate and seemingly chaotic patterns of the ocean waves. These natural systems are often too complex to fully understand, yet they exhibit a beauty that is undeniable.\n\nIn summary, the beauty of chaos lies in its ability to create unexpected and surprising outcomes, whether in art or in nature.

            "description": "Henge is an exploration of circular megalithic structures of the prehistoric age. It is a work of historical fiction where these stone assemblies, achieved through herculean efforts of stacking, aligning, and balancing immense chiseled rocks, are reimagined within an alternate universe of algorithmic possibility. Historically, henges share a few qualities that inspired this project. First, they are places of gathering within a loose collection of stones to organize ceremony or worship under celestial alignments. They are also monolithic in their materiality and employ the most elemental techniques of megalithic, or large stone, construction. These particular types of henges, known as cromlechs, are circular spaces fit with purpose and ritual and in this sense, serve as precedents to the great human edifices; charging landscapes with meaning and presence through geometry and order. Finally, henges are a collective language of place-making shared across a range of cultures and ages, from the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras and across territories from modern-day Morocco, Portugal, Brazil, Germany, Scandinavia, to the well-known Stonehenge in Great Britain.\n\nThis project is deeply inspired by the timeless and universal narrative created through the thoughtful and deliberate placement of large rocks in a circle. It seems that when confronted with marking a place and communing with nature, human beings like to make circles out of stones. Among all the symbols of place making, the circle is the original and still remains the most universal. Through the use of code to portray these imperfect structures, Henge animates the history of these circles in all their roughness and seemingly endless variation.\n\n\n--------\n\nCreated by Aranda\\Lasch @ArandaLasch\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\nNovember 2022\n\n[Interaction instructions]\n'left' + 'right' arrow keys to change view\n'i' saves a 2048x2048 PNG\n\n[Info]\np5.js\nHenge is optimized for Chrome, runs slowly on Firefox (the longer the wait, the more stones and/or grass are being generated)\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n10% of all primary and secondary proceeds donated directly to Girls Who Code\n",
