            "description": "\"Echoes of Enough\" is a collection that explores self-worth, acceptance, and validation. The collection presents a visual representation of the struggles, doubts, and triumphs of recognizing our own value. Each piece delves into different aspects of ourselves and how they contribute to this feeling.\n\nThe seemingly chaotic yet orderly arrangement of the shapes in this collection reflects the tumultuous nature of the human experience. It speaks to the push and pull of self-doubt and the struggle to acknowledge one's own worth, while the raw and unrefined nature of the collection reflects the brutal reality of the human experience.\n\nA hidden harmony beneath the surface represents the truth that we are all enough, just as we are. The collection invites the viewer to look within and acknowledge their own struggles and triumphs and to find comfort in the realization that the feeling of being enough is always present, like an echo that lingers. \n\nIt is a reminder that we are enough, just as we are.\n\n\n\nThe artwork is fully created in javascript with the p5js library. \nThe ideal viewing resolution is 1000x1000, and the artwork can be scaled to any size/resolution. The grain effect will fade slightly for higher resolutions. \n",

            "description": "\"Slice of Life\" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

            "description": "This project uses cellular automata where the state of a cell in a new generation is determined based on its own and its neighbors' states in the previous generation. The guiding rules for these transitions, however, are not static; they undergo a random change every few generations, chosen from a possible 256 rules. By also slightly shifting the positions of cells and using an outline and texture that conveys a hand-drawn style, I have tried introducing an element of organic randomness.\n\nStepping away from the monochromatic color scheme used in my last three series, I have used a gradient effect to convey a transitioning hue across generations, combining a palette of two colors selected from an array of 14 different palettes. \n\nNote on the name: The alternating rules and fluctuating cell positions serve as the apparent justification for its name. However, a subtler inspiration lies in my deep admiration for Franz Kafka and his remarkable short story, \"The Metamorphosis\". Kafka’s narrative explores the constantly evolving state of human existence, where patterns appear momentarily only to dissipate quickly. Just when you think you've spotted a pattern, poof, it changes. Just like in life, right :)\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

            "description": "This project uses cellular automata where the state of a cell in a new generation is determined based on its own and its neighbors' states in the previous generation. The guiding rules for these transitions, however, are not static; they undergo a random change every few generations, chosen from a possible 256 rules. By also slightly shifting the positions of cells and using an outline and texture that conveys a hand-drawn style, I have tried introducing an element of organic randomness.\n\nStepping away from the monochromatic color scheme used in my last three series, I have used a gradient effect to convey a transitioning hue across generations, combining a palette of two colors selected from an array of 14 different palettes. \n\nNote on the name: The alternating rules and fluctuating cell positions serve as the apparent justification for its name. However, a subtler inspiration lies in my deep admiration for Franz Kafka and his remarkable short story, \"The Metamorphosis\". Kafka’s narrative explores the constantly evolving state of human existence, where patterns appear momentarily only to dissipate quickly. Just when you think you've spotted a pattern, poof, it changes. Just like in life, right :)\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.
