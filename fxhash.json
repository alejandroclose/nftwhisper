            "description": "\"Aerial\" is a generative (100% code) abstract artwork, emphasizing to texturing and painting surface aging wear, inspired by surfaces with erosion - corrosion, craquelure (cracks), scratches, etc for example old drying oil or tempera painting in materials like canvas, wall, stone or wood. \n\nThe abstract shapes in many cases resemble like aerial eye view formations which gave and the name to this collection.\n\nThe input for each iteration is some simple geometry (boxes) i \"draw\" in a WebGL canvas, using for variation perlin noise values. Then manipulate the pixels and perform color mapping (color values from my palettes) inside a GLSL shader. \n\n\"Aerial\" includes 49 palettes (with several colors each) that have been stored externally (in the application folder) as Adobe \".act\" color table files so that avoiding hard coding (including all palettes in the code) consuming in this way resources eg. memory from user's system. I just load only the one palette i am going to use\n\nAll are 100% code, no images used.\n\nCONTROLS\n\nKEYS:\n\n- 1-3: Set resolution from 1x to 3x of the current dimension (possibly slower performance in higher values)\n- T: switch texture on/off\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait (default) with aspect ratio 0.85\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ when switching orientations or resizing\n\n----\nMade with p5js and custom shaders\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\nWant to know more ? please read the \"SHORT BIO\" section here in \"Emotions\" collection: https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/22243\n\n© Feb. 2023  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

            "description": "At moment we decide to draw a square on top of a circle, we are defining a time arrow, a third dimension on the 2D plane, where shapes can be on o top of each other, come one after the other. In this project i wanted to remove that time arrow, that third dimension, and leave the 2D plane as flat as possible.\n\nShapes are not drawn in sequence, they are formed by the continuous addition of points to each region defined by the shapes intersections. Not a single region is on top of the other. They are the result of the combination of shapes, and defined by them. Horizontal, decentralized societies. Espacios comunes. We can see the circles, squares, plane cuts, but we cannot give them an order or authority.\n\n-----\n\nKey controls:\n\n- UP arrow: Increases the sketch resolution. It will take longer to render but it will produce better quality images.\n- DOWN arrow: Decreases the sketch resolution.\n- f: Removes or adds an empty frame around the image.\n- d: Increases the points density. More points will be painted and regions will become more full.\n- n: Increases the pixel noise.\n- b: Decreases the pixel noise.\n- z: Switches on and off the simple pixel sorting algorithm. Move the mouse left and right to change the pixel stickiness.\n- x: Switches on and off a more complex version of the pixel sorting algorithm.\n- i: Displays some log information.\n- p: Pauses the sketch.\n- s: Saves a screenshot of the artwork. The image resolution will depend on the sketch resolution, which is controlled by the UP and DOWN arrows.\n\n-----\n\nURL controls:\n\nwidth=2000 will set the sketch width to 2000 pixels.\nproportion=2.3 will set the sketch width-to-height ratio to 2.3.\nYou can combine these two parameters to create any image output you want. For example, to create an image that is 3000 pixels wide and 5000 pixels high, one just needs to add &width=3000&proportion=0.6 to the URL.\n\n-----\n\nSpecial thanks to @andregorayeb (Gora) and @ItonkStudio (Itonk) for letting me use some of their color palettes for this project.\n\n-----\n\nLicense: CC BY 4.0\n\nThis project makes use of the p5.js library.

The result is a form reminiscent of architecture, cityscapes, or neural networks.\n\nThrough the use of the noise() function, the code initially draws lines that are then extended vertically and randomly slide across a certain area.  By repeating this process recurrently, the work itself becomes a visual image, with itself as a constituent element, while being damaged.\n\n\"Flux\" is also a work about autopoiesis (or self-organization) in damage.\n\nThe get()set() is to treat the image generated by the code as an image(), and it may damage the purity of the work as a code. Therefore, I view random get()set() as a metaphor for damage.\n\nThe parameter “interrupt” has a certain probability of being “true”; if it is “true”, the density of the strokes is reduced, but in combination with other parameters, it is not easy to determine whether interrupt is “true” or “false”. Therefore, it is a practically meaningless parameter (attribute), but I added this parameter to imagine an artificiality in the code of nature.\n\nCreating a dimensionless image (one that maintains the same output regardless of screen size) was a challenge due to the inevitable deterioration in resolution and rendering content when the same processing is performed at a smaller size.

            "description": "Direction determination refers to the ways in which a cardinal direction can be determined in navigation and wayfinding. The most direct method is using a compass, but indirect methods exist, based on the sun, the moon, the stars. It helped humans to explore the world as we know it.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'Cardinal directions' is inspired by minimalism and express natural human predisposition to explore the world. Our curiosity led as to where we are now. We explored the nature that surrounds us and were able to adapt to various circumstances. We overcome difficulties and used it to our favor.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe collection consists of 4 different geographical areas - mountains, woods, seas and plains. Each area has its own unique element - a monument created by humans as a symbol of how we adapt in different places.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeographical areas: Mountains, Woods, Seas, Plains;\nMonuments: Castles, Watch Towers, Lighthouses, Windmills;\nDaytime: Day, Night;\nMoon phase: Full, Waxing, Waning;\nWeather: Dusky, Cloudy, Clear;\nSky objects: Stars, Shooting Star, Birds;\nLegendary creature: Sea Snake (Rare).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResolution: 2000x2000 px\nPress [s] to download the piece as a png file\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Feb 2023\nArtist: Jidoari",
