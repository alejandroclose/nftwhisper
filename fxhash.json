            "description": "\n\n\nDigitally crafted flowers in pots for virtual window sills.\n\nIn the spirit of the piranha plant from the Mario Bros videogame. We wanted to create a project that acknowledges the playful depiction of nature in early videogames by creating a retro futuristic collectible that explores aesthetics over gameplay, whilst preserving the playful energy of these early digital worlds. There are many game elements that have emerged over the years that have become iconic in their own right. Their memorable designs have come to represent the exciting feeling of when we first discovered these worlds, but over time an appreciation for their simple design execution, harmony and balance has emerged. Art can exist in many forms and places including a digital pot plant.\n\nRarity:\n\nThere are a total of 23 hand-drawn and animated sprites divided into 4 groups Firelillies, Flytraps, Quasars and Stargazers and there are 15 possible combinations made from these 4 groups. 18% of the collection is a combination of these 4 groups which we can call random and the remaining 72% is divided between the remaining 14 combinations.\n\n\nThere are 3 possible grid systems 1x1, 3x3 and 4x4 \n\n3% 1x1\n\n40% 3x3\n\n57% 4x4\n\n\n\nThere are 14 possible placement points for all grids and 76 stem/sprite arragement in total\n\n\n\nFor the pots and stems there are 11 colors to choose and  no rarities for color combinations.\n\n\n\nThe flower distribution can be either symmetric or random. 35% symmetric and 65% random\n\n\n\nExport options:\n\nPressing 's' on desktop or holding for 2 seconds will download gif to whatever the current device resolution is. To export at a different resolution open the token in new window by clicking 'open' link under the token image and add \"&exportsize=1080\" or \"&exportsize=2160\" to end of the url and hit enter then either hold for 2 seconds or press 's' to create gif and download.\n\n\n\n ",

Then, cool things happen with colours. \n\nThis is an experimental project, created as part of a Speed Run over ~37 hours in one weekend (I did also sleep and eat in that time.

            "description": "\n\n\nDigitally crafted flowers in pots for virtual window sills.\n\nIn the spirit of the piranha plant from the Mario Bros videogame. We wanted to create a project that acknowledges the playful depiction of nature in early videogames by creating a retro futuristic collectible that explores aesthetics over gameplay, whilst preserving the playful energy of these early digital worlds. There are many game elements that have emerged over the years that have become iconic in their own right. Their memorable designs have come to represent the exciting feeling of when we first discovered these worlds, but over time an appreciation for their simple design execution, harmony and balance has emerged. Art can exist in many forms and places including a digital pot plant.\n\nRarity:\n\nThere are a total of 23 hand-drawn and animated sprites divided into 4 groups Firelillies, Flytraps, Quasars and Stargazers and there are 15 possible combinations made from these 4 groups. 18% of the collection is a combination of these 4 groups which we can call random and the remaining 72% is divided between the remaining 14 combinations.\n\n\nThere are 3 possible grid systems 1x1, 3x3 and 4x4 \n\n3% 1x1\n\n40% 3x3\n\n57% 4x4\n\n\n\nThere are 14 possible placement points for all grids and 76 stem/sprite arragement in total\n\n\n\nFor the pots and stems there are 11 colors to choose and  no rarities for color combinations.\n\n\n\nThe flower distribution can be either symmetric or random. 35% symmetric and 65% random\n\n\n\nExport options:\n\nPressing 's' on desktop or holding for 2 seconds will download gif to whatever the current device resolution is. To export at a different resolution open the token in new window by clicking 'open' link under the token image and add \"&exportsize=1080\" or \"&exportsize=2160\" to end of the url and hit enter then either hold for 2 seconds or press 's' to create gif and download.\n\n\n\n ",

            "description": "This project is borne out of my longstanding fascination with brushwork, and the intricate textures that can be created with a brush, some paint and a canvas. Brush strokes are simulated using many overlapping lines and given texture and depth using a custom shader. Another important aspect of this work, is the composite forms that are created by the brush strokes, which are my attempt to emulate the emphatic energy of many abstract painters that have come before me. Color palettes are named after common paint colors, based on the background color used for the palette.\n\nThose who collect during the first tier of the Dutch Auction can claim a signed print. They will be printed on A3 Hahnemuhle Photo Rag, and shipped to the collector free of charge. More details on how to claim a print and specify the necessary shipping information will be provided via the artists twitter (@landlinesart1).\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

            "description": "This project is borne out of my longstanding fascination with brushwork, and the intricate textures that can be created with a brush, some paint and a canvas. Brush strokes are simulated using many overlapping lines and given texture and depth using a custom shader. Another important aspect of this work, is the composite forms that are created by the brush strokes, which are my attempt to emulate the emphatic energy of many abstract painters that have come before me. Color palettes are named after common paint colors, based on the background color used for the palette.\n\nThose who collect during the first tier of the Dutch Auction can claim a signed print. They will be printed on A3 Hahnemuhle Photo Rag, and shipped to the collector free of charge. More details on how to claim a print and specify the necessary shipping information will be provided via the artists twitter (@landlinesart1).\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

Every step, A and B react with each other and diffuse into neighbouring cells. The amounts of diffusion and reaction have different settings, which can vary across the canvas or over time. Then, cool things happen with colours. \n\nThis is an experimental project, created as part of a Speed Run over ~37 hours in one weekend (I did also sleep and eat in that time. I even went for a walk. Go me). \n- It requires WEBGL2 and is GPU intensive. \n- There may be slight discrepancies in the patterns on different devices, due to rounding. \n\nBig thanks to everyone who followed along/offered advice and especially to Piter Pasma who helped me out with the noise dithering code that took everything to the next dimension.\n\nPress P to pause.\nPress 1-5 to alter speed.

            "description": "The third and final installment of the Self trilogy.\n\nEgo is defined as: the one of the three divisions of the psyche in psychoanalytic theory that serves as the organized conscious mediator between the person and reality especially by functioning both in the perception of and adaptation to reality.\n\nPlease see attached fx(text) article or go to https://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy for more on concept/mechanics/etc. It’s a bit of long read, but worth it.\n\nThis is an fx(params) project and you will be able to choose exactly what your iteration will look like. For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",
