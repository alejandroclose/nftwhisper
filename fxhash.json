            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "\"Earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do.\" – Unknown\n\nEarthquakes are not just natural disasters, but also human tragedies. They can strike suddenly and violently, leaving behind a trail of destruction and trauma that can last a lifetime. For survivors, the experience of an earthquake can be life changing.\n\nHomes and neighborhoods are reduced to rubble, and the familiar landmarks and memories of a lifetime are wiped away in an instant. In the aftermath of an earthquake, survivors must grapple with the emotional toll of their loss, the uncertainty of the future, and the challenge of rebuilding their lives.\n\nThe first step after a disaster is to provide emergency medical care, shelter, and basic necessities like food and water. Once these immediate needs are met, attention can turn to assessing the damage and developing a plan for reconstruction.\n\nThe rebuilding process can be a long and challenging journey, as it involves not only repairing physical damage but also restoring the social fabric of affected communities, addressing issues like housing, infrastructure, and economic recovery, as well as addressing the psychological and emotional impact of the disaster on individuals and communities.\n\nIt is crucial to rebuild using proper techniques and investing in the right resources to prevent similar disasters from happening in the future. Reconstruction must be done with a focus on resilience, sustainability, and safety. This means taking into consideration the local conditions, the latest research on earthquake-resistant materials and designs, and the needs of the affected communities.\n\nThe cost of not investing in proper reconstruction after an earthquake can be immense. Poorly constructed buildings and infrastructure can increase the risk of further damage in the event of another earthquake, leading to more loss of life and property. On the other hand, investing in proper reconstruction can help create a safer and more resilient environment, reducing the impact of future earthquakes and protecting the lives and livelihoods of those who call the affected region home.\n\nFor this reason, it is crucial that regions impacted by earthquakes receive immediate and adequate economic and technical support, and that available resources are managed with proper planning and great responsibility.\n\nThis generative art project explores the destructive power of earthquakes and seeks to capture the raw emotions of those who have experienced earthquakes and the transformation of their world into a memory.\n\n100% of the primary split is going to @tezquakeaid, Tezos community initiative providing aid to the victims of the catastrophic earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, 2023. \nOnce again the Tezos community has proven to be special. 💚\n\nHand coded after midnight.\nPowered by p5, matter & chroma.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\nThe generation takes some time but you can see the simulation and drawing process happening in real-time.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters and pressing the following keys, the artwork will regenerate at a different scale:\n\n- 1 -> 1.920x1.080\n- 2 -> 4.000x2.252\n- 3 -> 6.000x3.378\n- 4 -> 8.000x4.504\n\n=============> MAKING OF <=============\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/article/the-making-of-mercalli",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "\"Earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do.\" – Unknown\n\nEarthquakes are not just natural disasters, but also human tragedies. They can strike suddenly and violently, leaving behind a trail of destruction and trauma that can last a lifetime. For survivors, the experience of an earthquake can be life changing.\n\nHomes and neighborhoods are reduced to rubble, and the familiar landmarks and memories of a lifetime are wiped away in an instant. In the aftermath of an earthquake, survivors must grapple with the emotional toll of their loss, the uncertainty of the future, and the challenge of rebuilding their lives.\n\nThe first step after a disaster is to provide emergency medical care, shelter, and basic necessities like food and water. Once these immediate needs are met, attention can turn to assessing the damage and developing a plan for reconstruction.\n\nThe rebuilding process can be a long and challenging journey, as it involves not only repairing physical damage but also restoring the social fabric of affected communities, addressing issues like housing, infrastructure, and economic recovery, as well as addressing the psychological and emotional impact of the disaster on individuals and communities.\n\nIt is crucial to rebuild using proper techniques and investing in the right resources to prevent similar disasters from happening in the future. Reconstruction must be done with a focus on resilience, sustainability, and safety. This means taking into consideration the local conditions, the latest research on earthquake-resistant materials and designs, and the needs of the affected communities.\n\nThe cost of not investing in proper reconstruction after an earthquake can be immense. Poorly constructed buildings and infrastructure can increase the risk of further damage in the event of another earthquake, leading to more loss of life and property. On the other hand, investing in proper reconstruction can help create a safer and more resilient environment, reducing the impact of future earthquakes and protecting the lives and livelihoods of those who call the affected region home.\n\nFor this reason, it is crucial that regions impacted by earthquakes receive immediate and adequate economic and technical support, and that available resources are managed with proper planning and great responsibility.\n\nThis generative art project explores the destructive power of earthquakes and seeks to capture the raw emotions of those who have experienced earthquakes and the transformation of their world into a memory.\n\n100% of the primary split is going to @tezquakeaid, Tezos community initiative providing aid to the victims of the catastrophic earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, 2023. \nOnce again the Tezos community has proven to be special. 💚\n\nHand coded after midnight.\nPowered by p5, matter & chroma.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\nThe generation takes some time but you can see the simulation and drawing process happening in real-time.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters and pressing the following keys, the artwork will regenerate at a different scale:\n\n- 1 -> 1.920x1.080\n- 2 -> 4.000x2.252\n- 3 -> 6.000x3.378\n- 4 -> 8.000x4.504\n\n=============> MAKING OF <=============\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/article/the-making-of-mercalli",

            "description": "\nThis project is an evolution of the previous \"Spring will be back again\"\nIt has in common most of its characteristics but with only a selection of color palettes and other things like:\n\n- Just a few public features compared to the previous version \n- The sun is always drawn as full (without the stroked version)\n- The tree trunk can have a striped texture \n- There is a \"spoiled\" glitchy  version quite rare (2.5%)\n- There is a new command (\"f\" key) that makes the tree reflourish \n- By default each token has a different layout (vertical, horizontal,..) but it can be changed (see commands), in mobile is always vertical\n- And some other small details intended to improve the result\n\n\nAs the previous version this project aims to capture the essence of the Japanese hanami experience where people gather to admire the fleeting beauty of the cherry blossom.\n\nIt's a representation of the beauty of an unreal nature where the details of the leaves and flowers are imaginary and always different.\n\nCrafted entirely with lines of code in vanilla javascript, without the use of reference images or templates.\n\nEach time the animation is played, it generates a different version of the blossom trees, while still maintaining the features defined by the underlying token.\n\nYou may also change the resolution or the layout at any time, or toggle the animation mode.\n\n\n\nCommands\n\n[1] Low resolution\n[2] Normal resolution\n[3] High res\n[4] Super high res\n[5] Print res (not animated)\n\n[a] or [space] Reload in animation mode\n[s] Reload in static mode\n[d] Download snapshot in current resolution\n\n[f] Reflourish\n\nChange layout:\n\n[z] 1x2.5 (Portrait)\n[x] 1x2 (default in mobile)\n[c] 1x1.5 \n[v] 1x1 Square\n[b] 1.5x1\n[n] 2x1\n[m] 2.5x1\n\nMay be unresponsive on higher resolutions (in those cases turning off the animation mode is recommended)\n\n",

            "description": "Morixels Mega Colab is the first and one of the biggest Collaborations that happen on the FXHash  and also in Morixels Land.\n\nIn this Collaboration, 19 artists have designed their artwork as pixel art. Each artist has 5 Artworks in this collection, which have been randomly combined with Borders that I designed (Morteza Yousefi, idea owner and art director)\n\nThis combination has got a beautiful effect in a random way, and besides that, it makes this collection very valuable because of the reputation and Ideas of the 20 artists.\n\nThe number of Traits in this collection is 5 (137 layers) and it has the ability to make 930,240 NFTs.\n\nTo create balance, these NFTs are randomly minted, and this is a chance for everyone to get a rare version. So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\n\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\n🟧🟦\n🟧🟧\n\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nMade in 2022\n\nDesigned by: \n@morteza_yousefy\n@ardavan_\n@happyfamily1985\n@Raze_Slb\n@Didoxme\n@mo0n_zi\n@mahdirezafathi\n@HrishNft\n@HeleDesignnft\n@SebastianVamp21\n@farahmand1989\n@Samaneh_syd\n@ma_khalaji\n@negar_khozhandi\n@lvcteam8\n@Elid_33\n@OmidMahdavi7\n@ehsan_special\n@OmidiNariman\n@ARTsnakeNFT\n\n",

(sound is coded using Tone.js synths - no samples)\n\nPress \"p\" to pause the gyrations if you want to take a photo (press \"s\" to capture a picture)\n\nEventually (after 30 minutes or so), the sound will get more and more glitchy and end up in a noisy mess. Time to go home or bar-hopping...",

            "description": "RAUSCH is a series of generative artworks that explore imaginary digital architectures. \n\nThis series challenges traditional notions of architectural representation and raises important questions about the role of resolution in design. Just as the pixel resolution of an image affects its perceived quality, the resolution of an architectural space can affect its qualities and livability. By embracing digital variation through codes, this series explores the interplay between abstract and concrete space through multiple resolutions. \n\nRAUSCH is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by complex, chaotic and messy sensations, and aims to engage the viewer through a sense of wonder, disorientation, and awe.\n\nReleased on the occasion of Companions of Code, a group exhibition by VerticalCrypto Art at The NFT Gallery in London. \nCurated by Micol Ap. Exhibition 10-24 February 2023 \n\n___________________________________________________\nRAUSCH Controls:\n\nAnimation: \n• ‘1 - 2 - 3 - 4’ animate views\n• 'MouseClick' pause/play animation\n\nFunctions:\n(press key & wait)\n• 'F' 24 FPS\n• 'B' b/w mode \n\nResize Canvas:\n(press key & wait)\n• '6' Portrait A4 - 1000x1414\n• '7' Landscape 16:9 - 1920x1080\n• '8' Portrait 9:16 - 1080x1920\n• '9' Square 1:1 - 1024x1024\n• 'DoubleClick' Fullscreen\n\nSave & Export Image:\n• 'S' save a .png of in current resolution\n\nSave & Export GIF:\n• 'G' save a 1-2 sec. seamless loop .gif of current view \n• 'P' save a 12-24 sec. seamless loop .gif of all the views\n• 'T’ scale down current resolution, save a 12 sec. seamless loop .gif\n\nSteps to save a gif/png :\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• resize canvas with 6,7,8, or 9 to your desired aspect ratio (wait)\n• press S,G or P to save & download (wait) \n• enjoy RAUSCH :)\n\nSave & Export GIF for social media sharing:\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• press T or G wait for recalculation & download. \n• enjoy RAUSCH \n• post on Twitter ;)\n__________________________________________________\n\nThis token may not work on mobile(!), but it allows exporting .png and .gif (see controls) to enjoy RAUSCH on different displays or mobile.
