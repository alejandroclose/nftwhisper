            "description": "This project, like most of my work, is about order and disorder.\n\nThe grid, the archetype of order, is used to arrange a set of rectangles. These rectangles are then extruded to become blocks/boxes. Here the perspective is created by means of a formula of projection of points on an isometric plane. Depth of field only exists because a sequence of instructions erases the background as the composition is built.\n\nOrder is also present in the succession of each of these steps.\nAnd disorder? It is very subtle, insidious, but nevertheless it exists in certain details within these blocks. These are details that do not follow the general shape of the box, residual, forgotten parts of blocks that have been erased.\n\n\n----\nNOTE ON THE TITLE\n\nThe title Playtime refers to the film (1967) by Jacques Tati, the cubes generated here evoke the settings of the film (the exteriors of this modern city and certain interior settings such as the open spaces). The analogy is made in the perception of these spaces, thanks to the use of the depth of field of the glass and the reflections.\n\nA link is also made through the film's few dialogues. The characters do not really understand each other, they speak several languages (French, English, German and some are not subtitled). The misunderstanding arose during the writing of this programme in the form of a bug, an error in the way of erasing certain parts of the composition in the background. Once the error was corrected, the composition offered little interest because the volumes described were perfectly solid, eliminating any perception of depth. This misunderstanding of the way my programme works gave place to a singular perception of space and depth.\n\n\n----\nFEATURES & OPTIONS\n\nGrid size: indicates the number of rows the iso grid will contain (between 14 and 22)\n\nZoom:  the magnification factor of the composition (between 0.7 and 1.74).\n\nBlock height: between 0.15 and 0.50, determines the general height of the blocks and the vertical position of the grid  \n\nHeight variation: how the height of each block is decided, three chances out of five, to have a totally random arrangement otherwise the height decreases from left to right or from right to left.\n\nIso angle: between 1.85 and 2.1, the smaller this parameter is, the more the grid is seen in bird's eye view (projection = [x-y, (x+y) / {angle}]).\n\nCrop mode: This parameter depends on the zoom feature, from a certain threshold (>1.11), the blocks will be cut cleanly according to the margins (hard), otherwise they will simply be deleted (soft) if they go out of the frame (in whole or in part).\n\nPalette: The three colours used respectively for the background, the texture (not included in the SVG) and the lines. 90% chance of getting a black line on a white background.\n\nFormat: portrait (A3) or square, 50% chance of getting one or the other.\n\nOptions & exports available in live mode (fxhash.xyz) or at IPFS artifact url (objkt.com) by clicking on the canvas, a window will open allowing you to export the drawing (PNG and SVG) as well as different formats.\n\n\n----\nRESOURCE & LICENSE\n\nDeveloped in Typescript (with 2D Canvas) with the Greiner-Hormann polygon clipping package (NPM: greiner-hormann), Playtime is a plottable NFT, it is part of the Hybrid Series (for more information click on the canvas on live mode).\nThis project is licensed under the MIT license.\n\n\n----\n\nNicolas Lebrun / @nclslbrn / nicolas-lebrun.fr",

I struggle to be present in the moment because of anxieties related to the past or the future.\n\n\"On Time\" explores the elusive nature of time and my relationship with it. Through this project, I aimed to create an experience that captures the way that we each experience time in our own way. Seeing that time is not linear but instead, it ebbs and flows in different ways.\n\nAt the heart of the experience is a visual reminder to stay in the moment and embrace it. The project consists of 256 unique visuals, each one representing a fleeting moment that has been captured in digital form. These moments are presented in a way that allows you to observe them, appreciate them, and stay present in them. \"On Time\" is an invitation to pause, take a deep breath, and remind ourselves that we are always where we need to be.\n\nControls\n[ f ] - fullscreen\n[ s ] - save the current frame as an image\n\nCreated with Three.js\nCopyright (c) Dec. 2022 - Feb. 2023 Shaderism",

            "description": "We have an impossible plan:\nTo negate any plan.\nLet ideas drop, and bloom\nand their fruits, crystalize.\n\nFeel the call of intention,\nlaser focus on this, not that;\nOr let it dilute in randomness,\na liberated slide left and right.\n\nStacking sketches and notes\nwe look at a mirror as we type,\nare we looking for something\nor has something already found us?\n\nWe move in oblique patterns,\nfinding meaning in the fray.\nIf our art takes on a life of its own,\ndo we simply guide it on its way?\n\n________________\n\n\nConcept:\n\nObliqua is a visual meditation on a generative artist's dilemma, the tension between conscious search and fortuitous find. And a question for both artist and observer: What is \"meaning\", if there's any, and who is in charge of that? By evoking (apparent?) dualities such as incipient/completed, natural/artificial, flat/volumetric, and outdated/advanced..., the piece welcomes ambiguity as a dear and helpful friend.\n\n\nMinting Params:\n\nSome parameters define geometric structure and layout while others control more stylistic or expressive features. Color palettes have been composed and chosen as they are presented, but they can be slightly adjusted with contrast, saturate and brightness params. Some style options can be toggled on/off with your keyboard (i.e. you may want to toggle grain off for printing). Please read below.\n\n\nLive mode controls:\n\nPress the following keys to download the artwork at different sizes:\n- S: Current size (default 2100 x 2970 px)\n- 1: Small, 2100 x 2970 px\n- 2: Medium, 4200 x 5940 px\n- 3: Large, 6300 x 8910 px\n- 4: Largest, 8400 x 11880 px\n- V: SVG (multiple-file download)\n\nAnd these other ones for toggling style options:\n- L: Toggle Glow\n- R: Toggle Grain\n- H: Toggle Shadow\n- W: Toggle Worn\n- F: Toggle Frame\n\n\nNotes:\n\n- Some outputs can be quite intensive in terms of computation, especially at higher resolutions, so they require a capable, relatively modern computer and browser. Best viewed in Chrome. Firefox and Edge should work too, although slower. Safari is not supported. Please make sure the artwork is rendered properly on your device and browser before minting.\n- SVG can be downloaded for plotting. For convenience, the download is split into different files for lines and fills. Fills will always be exported as solid colors.\n\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\nThanks everyone who provided help directly or indirectly by publishing useful articles, online-forums threads, and giving support and feedback on Twitter, Discord, and elsewhere. Special thanks to the authors of some code libraries included in this project:\n\n- p5.js\n- p5.grain\n- svgcanvas\n- quadtree-ts\n\n\n----------\n\nDaniel Aguilar, April 2023\nTwitter: @protozoo\nInstagram: @prtzart\nWebsite: https://protozoo.xyz\n\nNFT License 2.0\n\n----------\n\nSigned prints:\n\n- Unique, signed high-quality prints are available for this project (1 for iteration)\n- Collectors minting at the Dutch Auction's start price (highest) are entitled to their iteration's print at no additional cost\n- Collectors minting at lower prices can order their print for 120€ (EUR and XTZ welcome)\n- Print requests/orders can be made within one month after auction date.\n\n",

Some extreme sounds (frequency and amplitude) can be generated.\n\n-Supply can be halved/reduced and/or the price can be raised (never lowered) if all iterations have not been minted (every 24h aprox).",
