            "description": "Uninhabitable is a generative system built only from ellipses. The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state. Press \"h\" to save it.\n\nUninhabitable is an original work by Iskra Velitchkova. 2021.",

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",
