Intrigued by this challenge, I've delved deep into the pixels of this issue. 🙂\n\nDrawing inspiration from Rev Dan Catt’s 'Tally!' and applying similar principles of Cable Management, I've assembled a fun and free OE project.\n\nThis project dynamically evolves with each iteration.Grid is determined by a random value calculated as follows: the lower bound starts at 3 and increases incrementally with every 100 iterations, while the upper bound starts at 4 and increases with every 30 iterations. In practical terms, as the iteration count increases, both the minimum and maximum possible number of cols&rows gradually increase.\n\n3200x3200px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

Every time they are minted, and every time a new hash is generated, a new power is given to them. The Nakachoii soldier will fit inside your wallet and protect it with these powers. We are very happy that we gained so much experience on fxhash during its first year, and finally, we were able to create a great project based on all these experiences.

            "description": "The concept of organic, obtained from living systems, is said to be an effect that, like a plant and a living being, has grown in a completely dynamic manner in different degrees, and no factor except vital forces has prevented its growth. Organic creation is an example of this type. Léonard de Vinci believed in nature; he wrote, \"Painting is a child of nature\" in his opinion, art should be compatible with nature. His public image of creativity was \"innovation while maintaining fidelity\" to nature. According to Michelangelo, the form the artist gives to the materials is in the artist's mind and the materials themselves. Therefore, the artist is always in a metaphysical struggle with the form and secrets of nature. This is a revelatory process through which the artist discovers the mass of paper already hidden in his mind and the materials. As an architect, I tried to create this work while paying attention to the structuralism of shapes and forms in creation, inspired by the colors in nature and my experience in painting and illustration.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of royalty on each secondary sale.\nEighteen different color palettes and three different borders are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated August 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "Can nature really be a gift if it isn't ours to give?\nDo we feel the need to bind it close in the ways of old to live?\nIf a gift was given would all be forgiven, a place of harmony now we can live in?\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nA gift of nature, sort of. As natural as a digital gift can be. It is a gen art token of my gratitude you might say. It is the younger sibling of \"The Spectrum of Nature\". \n\nThis is a gift from me to you, a gift of nature that pulls you through. \n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nTo know more about the concept and technicalities of this piece, see the fxtext article “The spectrum of nature - a short making of”. However, feel free to skip the article.\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nBasic info:\nThe initial render will be 1000px wide and 1000px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x2000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x9000 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

            "description": "It may appear as an indecipherable map to some. To others, it may present itself as a cross section of an underground cave. Or maybe an uncanny landscape of volcanic activity, a diagram of geological strata, or even something else entirely. Some vague structure may also appear; is it the remains of an ancient civilization? Or perhaps a glimpse into our own tomorrow?\n\nIn \"Agharta\", I sought to create a generative work that could invite the viewer to explore the depths of their imagination and uncover hidden structures within the seemingly chaotic composition. The idea came to me when I was exploring Simplex noise and pixel displacement in Cables. I was surprised by the emergent structures that appeared when some set of parameters paired with the right texture. \n\nThe title of the piece references the mythical underground world said to be located at the earth's core. This idea of hidden depths and secret worlds within the earth resonates with the abstract and enigmatic nature of the result generated by the noise. Imagery of landscape, vague structures, or geological features may appear but never stand out on its own; it exists in a state of constant flow and intersection as if viewed from another dimension. And just like the myth itself that bring up numerous theories that doesn’t necessarily connected to each other, it hints at that idea of an elusive imagined realm while never actually represent it completely.\n\n\n\n=========\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024px (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048px\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840px\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[Scroll/pinch] to zoom and drag to pan\n\n[r] or [zoom out to max] Reset position\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot of the current state at rendered resolution\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* This project use shaders that relies on GPU. Hi-res output may slow down your device. Since it also utilize GPU instance for thumbnail rendering, expect longer time for every iterations to be signed by fx(hash).\n\n* If 'glitching' occurs or the composition behaves differently at different resolution, just refresh the page to reset it (except for the thin lines, which are always drawn at approximately 1 pixel, so expect it to vary at different resolution).\n\nMade with cables.gl, a node-based webgl environment\n\nXALTED 2022",
