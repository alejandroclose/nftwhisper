            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

In this series, urban ensembles are generated with a simple click. With each iteration appears a new densely built city block. Graced with impeccable geometrical lines, devoid of any human presence, these buildings remind us of brutalist utopias like Le Corbusier’s Cité radieuse or Niemeyer’s Brasilia. But despite their clearly modernist feel, there is something hauntingly primitive about them. They could be either New Mexican adobe pueblos, Minoan palaces, or Turkish troglodyte dwellings. Both carved and sculpted, these Ghormenghasts of concrete float in a realm out of time, like in some architect’s dream.\n\nThe purpose of this creative work is to generate 3D architectural projects that could be implemented in the real world. The accelerating lives that we live, complicated by growing and unpredictable environmental crises, call for an enhanced capacity to come up quickly with new architectural solutions adapted to different contexts. From computer assisted design to 3D printing, from augmented reality to real-life housing, from sculpture to architecture, this work aims at bridging the gap between the virtual and the tangible.\n\nWorking as a visual artist, David Umemoto draws inspiration from his training as an architect. He has been using low-tech methods for a long time, refining his talent for elegant simple shapes and combinatory constructions. Now, poured concrete and home-made moulds are giving way to zero-gravity rotating models. The skills he developed while working with real objects find a new playground in the virtual realm.\n",

A rare variation will create a charcoal drawing on white or black paper. Super rare will create a lighted winter scene that may have a moon behind the tree.\n\nViewing in desktop Chrome is recommended for the best results.\n\nPress 's' to save a screenshot at any point. Image size is 1400x1082px.\n\nAdd '&size=#' to the end of the live view URL to render a variation of your edition at a resolution from 300 to 3,000 px.\n\nOn the paintings only, adding '&bg=true' will stop the painting after the background. Adding '&size=3000&bg=true' will give you a nice desktop background! \n\nCommon Features:\n- About 12-14 trees\n- One of the four seasons\n- One of 12 highlight color tints\n- One of 12 shadow color tints\n- Varying levels of distance haze\n- Varying max brush sizes\n- Varying amount of colors in the strokes\n\nLess Common\n- 15% chance of a charcoal drawing\n- 50% chance it to be a dark winter scene\n\nRare\n- Winter drawing with lights on the tree\n\nSuper Rare\n- Winter drawing with a moon behind the tree\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Matt Perkins, hello@mattperkins.me, @nudoru on Twitter.

            "description": "A piece stepping away from control and leaning into minimalism, there are several factors at play to make your Esagoni unique. Both of the two hexagon colors are a random RGB value, at various luminosities.\n\nThe root of separation chooses which color takes the lead, between 1-100, 50 being evenly distributed.\n\nThe separation between the two colors can vary from 0-100, 0 is a 1% chance.\n\nModifiers can be either Circular or Hexagonal.\n\nThe scale of the hexagons on the grid varies from 1-100.\n\nThere is a 10% chance of a monochrome Esagoni, 5% respectively to both \"Black on White\" and \"White on Black.\"\n\n\nThis piece can also be changed to infinite resolutions, for any frame or screen you'd like to display it on.\n\nIn live view, press:\n\n'w' to view in 16:9\n\n't' to view in 8x10\n\n's' to view in 1x1\n\n'f' to adapt to your own screen size\n\nDouble-click to save image\n\nEnjoy :)",
