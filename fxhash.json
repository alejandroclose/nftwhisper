            "description": "INSPIRATION\n\nSpirali was inspired by Tyler Hobbs' work with flow fields. However, instead of selecting random starting points for each shape to be drawn, which is more usual in flow fields works, I wanted to constrain the starting points to certain positions so that the shape being drawn could expand freely without the risk of colliding with other shapes, that's when I got to the spiral flow field.\n\nWHY SPIRALI?\n\nThe name of this collection is not only a direct translation of spirals in Italian, but it is also related to Italian cuisine and my own personal experience in Italy. The relationship with Italian cuisine is due to the immense number of types of pasta that exist, including one called spirali. When I was a child I only knew three or four types of pasta, but when I became a bit older I was amazed to learn that there were many more. Actually, there are hundreds. Just like from the same type of basic dough, you can make hundreds of types of pasta, my idea was, from just one type of spiral flow field, to make hundreds of images. A strategy of forcing creativity by imposing a major constraint.\n\nThe name of this collection also relates to my personal experience because it was visiting Italy many years ago that I first became interested in art and design because of the beautiful buildings, churches and works of art that I came across.\n\nDESIGN STRATEGY\n\nA spirali is made up of several tails and each tail is made up of a basic element, which I called slice. A tail may have from one to thousands slices. It is mainly the variation in the number of slices and how they are colored that creates the different tail styles in each spirali.\n\nThe slices start at the center of the spiral and in each iteration they grow a certain length or split in two depending on the parameters used in the algorithm, which also determine the outline and fill of each slice when it is rendered.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe main features that a spirali can have are:\n\n- Styles: Refers to the drawing patterns of each tail, that means, the shape, fill and stroke of the slices that form the tail. There are about 16 possible styles from which the algorithm will choose about 3 for each spirali.\n\n- Zoom out: It is related to how much larger the flow field area is in comparison to the image area. There are two possibilities: 50% and 100%.\n\n- Curvature: An arbitrary measure of the rate the tails of a spirali are turning. A spirali can have high or low curvature.\n\n- Rotation: The rotation direction: clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n- Tails: The number of tails in a spirali.\n\n- Palette: The palette's name. There are about 14 possible palettes.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n\n- Press \"m\" to export a medium resolution image (2000px x 2000px);\n- Press \"h\" to export a high resolution image (6000px x 6000px);\n\nLICENSING\n\nPlease see license.txt file.\n\nTwitter: @PauloSilvaGArt\nSite: https://paulosilva.art",

            "description": "I try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "[ TAP/CLICK TO ACTIVATE SOUND ]\n\nA whiff of pattern begins to emerge. Out of disarray comes the familiar pulsation of an ordered signal. The sense of regularity strengthens and we feel it swelling towards a singularity. Heeere weeee goooo… BAM! Then off again marching back into chaos to repeat the cycle.\n\nProposed by cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter in his 1979 book “Gödel, Escher, Bach”, and further developed in his 2007 book “I Am a Strange Loop”, “Strange Loops” are Hofstadter’s attempt at explaining the mechanisms that give rise to the sensation of “I” - through hierarchical, self-referential, and at times seemingly paradoxical feedback-loops of abstraction and causality. \n\n—\n\n“Who shoves whom around in the tangled megaganglion that is your brain, and who shoves whom around in ‘this teetering bulb of dread and dream’ that is mine?”\n\n“Do dreads and dreams, hopes and griefs, ideas and beliefs, interests and doubts, infatuations and envies, memories and ambitions, bouts of nostalgia and floods of empathy, flashes of guilt and sparks of genius, play any role in the world of physical objects? Do such pure abstractions have causal powers? Can they shove massive things around, or are they just impotent fictions?” \n\n\"In the end, we are self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages that are little miracles of self-reference. [...] Poised midway between the unvisualizable cosmic vastness of curved spacetime and the dubious, shadowy flickerings of charged quanta, we human beings, more like rainbows and mirages than like raindrops or boulders, are unpredictable self-writing poems — vague, metaphorical, ambiguous, and sometimes exceedingly beautiful.”\n\n- Douglas Hofstadter, “I Am a Strange Loop”, 2007\n\n–-\n\nMemo Akten \nƈօʍքʊtǟtɨօռǟʟ Aʀȶɨֆȶ; AI wrangler; curious philomath; PhD in Creative Artificial Intelligence with Meaningful Human Control; works with code to create images, sounds, films, large-scale responsive installations and performances; fascinated by trying to understand the nature of nature and the human condition.\n\nJames Paterson \nSynthesizing drawing, animation, sculpture and code under the moniker Presstube since 1999. Inspired by meditation, molecular biology, music, parenting, psychedelics, the seen, the heard, the felt, the cognized.\n\n–-\n\nControls:\n- CLICK/TAP ONCE ON THE SCREEN TO ACTIVATE SOUND\n- ‘S’: to toggle Sound on/off (only works when opened fullscreen)",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch C has added a subtractive / destructive element to the simple grid from Sketches A and B. Colors are mostly the same, but more variation has been added to the outputs as well as the hue and saturation of the colors themselves. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.",

Looking especially deep into dynamic grids and dynamic frame rates.\n\nAs for the piece itself, it's a reference to how busy this modern world is. How we're all constantly on the go, whether that is physically, or mentally. Almost feeling like a monsoon. A storm of information. A storm of life. A storm of work. A storm of thoughts. A storm of emotions. A storm of everything. And it's all so fast.\n\nAs are the particles. They're all moving around these cyclones of information. Glowing up like neon signs in a busy city. Moving so fast it's almost a blur. Forming into something greater than the sum of its parts.\n",

            "description": "Fêlure is a piece picturing our inner selves.\n\nFêlure means a crack in french. It can almost be pronounced as Failure. But not quite.\n\nIt started from a square, that was cracked into many fragments. From outside, it is still a square, stable, reliable. From inside, it is a mess, with many experiences, each one being unique, each one with its own specificity.\n\nEven though we relate to others, there is no definition of normal. No one looks the same. This is why the palettes are all generated and there can be an infinity of them. Some have more darkness than others. Some are warmer, some are cooler. Some are a mix of many things.\n\nOur experiences and our cracks shape us. Sometimes following a natural flow. Sometimes following specific rules. But always guiding us as a whole.\n\n----\n\nThe day I started working on this piece, I realized that I often show myself as chill, ready to give a hand, ready to listen to others. But who am I to help others when I'm not sure about who I am or even what I am?\n\nMaybe that's why I'm able to relate. Because I have my own experiences that cracked me. And built me. So even if I'm a mess, even if I'm not sure about where I'm going, let's share and try to find out together.\n\n----\n\n- The images are meant to be viewed in an horizontal full screen but will adapt to any format\n- Click on the image to restart the animation\n- Hit \"S\" key or long tap on mobile in the live view to trigger an export\n- Add &width=5000 to the live view URL to render the image at 5000 pixels wide\n\n----\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienPradetArt",

In the present work, I sought to preserve characteristics of the first, such as a similar color palette, but mainly the exploration of bezier and basic shapes such as the point. Flowers symbolize the feeling of gratitude, coming from different angles, sizes and shapes, just like people. Perspective can be taken from the ground to the universe in the presence of grids, planets and stars depending on their presence and position.",
