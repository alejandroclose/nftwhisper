            "description": "\"Kumano (Emergent Structures 1)\" is a collection of generative works that emulate analog effects from painting, printmaking, and textile design. It is the first generative collection in a continuing series called Emergent Structures.\n\nThe title of this collection is borrowed from Kumano-zome (熊野染め), a traditional Japanese craft of resist-dyed fabric that creates beautiful analog interference patterns (moiré). These textiles, often rendered in tones of indigo dye, date back at least two hundred years, and yet they can feel magically modern. \n\nThe primary structure of \"Kumano\" is a mesh of overlapping angled lines that function just like the hand-printed lines in Kumano-zome textiles.\n\nMy background is in abstract painting, and one of my goals for this collection was to create an abstract \"painting space\" and develop a painterly visual language, and then treat the outputs like I would treat a running series of paintings; exploring and working through all the ideas, within certain constraints, trying to exhaust every possibility.\n\nI wanted the outputs to look like they were created by hand, with soft edges and manual imperfections. Colors are deliberately \"mis-registered\" and shapes/lines are subtly askew. The \"Viscosity\" feature turns emergent moiré patterns into flattened, solid forms, and renders them as if they were painted with watercolors, or stamped with bleeding inks.\n\n\nThe composition of each piece is mostly determined by five main components:\n\n1. Layers of repeating lines at various angles and spacing, which often overlap and interact to create complex moiré patterns (Kumano Layers)\n\n2. A \"Horizon\" section that creates a foreground space and a horizon line, bringing the piece into a painterly landscape space\n\n3. Bold caution stripes of various color, thickness, opacity, and orientation\n\n4. Floating \"Satellite\" shapes that sometimes appear, evoking moons or man-made objects hovering in space\n\n5. A special mix of \"Viscosity\" and \"Erosion\" that makes the paint bleed, congeal, and dissolve in unpredictable ways\n\n\nThe overarching color story of each piece is determined by a few interrelated palettes:\n\n- Ten possible Background Colors\n- Eight possible palettes for the layered lines (Kumano Palette)\n- Eight possible colors of Caution Stripes\n- Six possible colors for the Horizon/Foreground layer\n\nWhen applied in combination and then run through the Viscosity and/or Erosion filters, the breadth of color possibilities is enormous, but always remains connected and coherent.\n\n\nThe algorithm's compositional structure also shows extreme variety, from highly complex to super clean, minimal, and subtle. Everything in the artwork is generated directly from the p5.js script; no external inputs, filters, or images are used.\n\n\nThese pieces are best viewed at large scale in order to appreciate the fine details and nuance. To save a high-res version, just type \"S\" on your keyboard and a high-res PNG will be generated and downloaded. This can take some time, so please be patient while it renders in the background. In most browsers the high-res output will be 5000 x 6250px (31+ megapixels).",

            "description": "\"Fleurs dans le vent\" seeks to capture the moment when the leaves of the plants detach and are displaced by the wind accompanied by a set of flowers. As usual we maintain the algorithm based on the interpolation of curves to generate the elements of the vegetation.\n\nThis time we present 15 parameters that you can modify and obtain the desired result. It also has four types of canvas, three color palette modules, one for the flowers, another for the background leaves and finally for the canvas. It also has the features system to measure the rarity of the pieces in the collection. The following is a brief explanation of the parameters:\n\n✅[ Seed ] : Guarantees that you see what you see at the moment. Modifying this value changes the distribution of elements on the canvas and re-randomizes the distribution of colors.\n✅[ Format ]: Select the format that the canvas will have\n✅[ Margin ]: Sets the width of the canvas frame\n✅[ Background ]: Sets the color of the canvas\n✅[ Pattern ]: Select a background pattern\n✅[ Ink ]: Select the ink color\n✅[ Flower Palette ]: Select the color palette for the flowers\n✅[ Flower Type ]: Select the type of flower\n✅[ flowerDensity ]: Modifies the amount of flowers that are drawn\n✅[ flowerChanceFill ]: Probability with which the flowers will be colored\n✅[ flowerScale ]: Controls the scale of the flowers\n✅[ Leaves Palette ]: Select the color palette for the background leaves\n✅[ Leaves Type ]: Select the type of leaves for the background\n✅[ Leaves Density ]: Controls the amount of leaves that are drawn in the background\n✅[ Leaves Scale ]: Controls the scale of the background leaves\n\nTo download the image press [ s]\n\nWe hope you like this work!",

Releasing this project means a lot, not only from the work I've put in it, but from the chapter of my life it closes.",

            "description": "In creating this piece, I found myself drawn to the intersection where technology meets literature, a space where code and creativity become inseparable. It's a unique blend of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" and the unpredictable nature of AI-generated visuals.\n\nHuxley's dystopian vision always struck a chord with me, especially in today's rapidly advancing technological landscape. I saw parallels between his world and the way generative art evolves - both shaped by their environments, reflecting fears, hopes, and the inherent chaos of their times.\n\nBut what really fascinated me was how human touch still played a role. Much like the characters in \"Brave New World\" wrestling with destiny, the AI visuals in my work, though algorithmically birthed, were guided by my hand. They're not just a reflection of the text but a response to it, engaging in a dialogue that goes beyond mere replication.\n\nThis isn't just a generative token; it's a question, a conversation. It's my way of exploring where we stand at this crossroads of art, literature, and technology. In crafting this piece, I found myself wondering, what does our Brave New World look like? How do we balance the precision of code with the fluidity of human emotion? And in a world increasingly dictated by algorithms, where do we fit in?\n\nI invite you to join me in this exploration. Let's unravel the tapestry, decode the symbols, and discover what it means to be human in a world where art and AI coalesce.\n\n- Press \"T\" to save the text contained within the composition, derived from it´s specific chapter \n- Press \"S\" to save a .png of the composition",

The compositions can be chaotic and maybe even a little messy, but they also can be vibrant and diverse… which is really what this is trying to celebrate: diversity and expression.\n\nSimply, it’s about the emotions associated with whatever frees you.\n\nPlease see the linked fxtext article (on the main project page) for a more in-depth dissection of the concept. It’s less of a technical discussion, and more about the experience of the artist, and how it became linked with the feelings they associate with the art.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nFor higher resolutions, you can append “&density=2” to the url to double the size, “&density=3” to triple, and so on.\n(This is highly recommended.)\n\nTo adjust grain, you can append “&grain=##” to the url. 40 is the default, and 0 will remove it completely.",

Releasing this project means a lot, not only from the work I've put in it, but from the chapter of my life it closes.",
