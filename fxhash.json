            "description": "Element is a generative series of pixelated mosaics that explores two contrasting styles of generative art. One style embraces imperfection and noise to simulate paint or other real-life textures, while the other produces digital outputs with precise forms.\n\nThe mosaics were inspired by the works of Hiroshi Kawano, one of the pioneers of generative art. They are generated by randomly placing rectangles inside a grid then applying a Markov-chain process multiple times. A hand-drawn and organic style is then incorporated using various techniques such drawing many rectangles with subtle variations in colour for a paint texture or adding different kinds of noise.\n\nPlease view in full-screen for the best experience.\n\nPress [s] when the output is fully rendered to download it as a png file. The resolution can be set by adding for example \"&s=2048\" to the url for a 2048 x 2048 output.\n\nElement was released as part of the Cure3 exhibition, generating vital funds for Cure Parkinson's medical research.",

Gardens have always been small pieces of paradise for me, and hearing the word in Armenian triggers a flood of warm memories.\n\nMemories of wandering around my grandfather’s garden, plucking ripe plums and figs from their branches.\nMemories of playing in my parents yard, the scent of jasmine in the summer heat.\nOf sun warmed tomatoes in my mom’s vegetable patch.\nThe smell of dirt and grass.\nMud on my hands.\nSun on my skin.\nMemories of paradise.\n\nI hope you enjoy these gardens I’ve planted, and I hope they remind you of some warm and wonderful memories.\n \nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n - This piece uses a shader to compute the lighting of the terrain in the first frame. If you don’t have a graphics card, you may have difficulty running this.\n\n - Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done.

I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you the progress of the render, and also show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system.

            "description": "This project is about uncovering artifacts.\n\nEach piece is determined by approximately 15 parameters. This allows for a multitude of possible forms, and each iteration is an artifact to be discovered within the multidimensional space.\n\nThis work is focused around discovery. It is about exploring the space of the algorithm, shedding light on its many forms, and sometimes finding artifacts of the real world embedded within them.\n\nTechnically, this work is a composition of three primary elements: Voronoi tessellations, orthographic projection, and the depth-sort algorithm.\nThe latter of these is integral to the rendering mechanism. It works intuitively, drawing distant objects before near objects, evaluating the distance of each object according to its geometric center. It does this precisely, and in doing so, it can produce interesting visual artifacts, drawing some shapes in an unexpected order.\n\n\n\nThis has been a fascinating study, bringing light to unreal shapes and forms, and uncovering artifacts in an impossible space.\n\nI hope you enjoy it,\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Notes:\n- Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier.

This allows for a multitude of possible forms, and each iteration is an artifact to be discovered within the multidimensional space.\n\nThis work is focused around discovery. It is about exploring the space of the algorithm, shedding light on its many forms, and sometimes finding artifacts of the real world embedded within them.\n\nTechnically, this work is a composition of three primary elements: Voronoi tessellations, orthographic projection, and the depth-sort algorithm.\nThe latter of these is integral to the rendering mechanism. It works intuitively, drawing distant objects before near objects, evaluating the distance of each object according to its geometric center. It does this precisely, and in doing so, it can produce interesting visual artifacts, drawing some shapes in an unexpected order.\n\n\n\nThis has been a fascinating study, bringing light to unreal shapes and forms, and uncovering artifacts in an impossible space.\n\nI hope you enjoy it,\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Notes:\n- Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done.",

            "description": "\"MOUNTAINS\" is a work that belongs to the \"FLUX Series\", which utilizes the same techniques and processes as the previous work \"FLUX\". The shape in this piece is created by placing elements using noise and then performing recursive pixel operations on these elements.\n\nThe inspiration behind this work came from my continued sketches and studies of Flow Field, which led me to discover an expression of objects that seemed to be corroding. I believed that by applying this technique, I could create a realistic and vivid sculpture from a geometric shape.In this work, this corrosion treatment is applied to a geometric triangular shape of overlapping rectangles to form a realistic and dynamic mountain landscape.\nIt was as if geometric figures like Plato's \"ideas\" were materialized in the real world.\n\nAdditionally,  I was also inspired by the mountain views from my hometown at New Year's and by the manga background paintings of Yoshiharu Tsuge, who specializes in depicting villages with old hot springs.\n\nIt is possible to get a 5760 x 3240 px png file by right click save.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries.\n\nArtwork by hasaqui, @hasaqui.\nMade with p5js\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n",

This allows for a multitude of possible forms, and each iteration is an artifact to be discovered within the multidimensional space.\n\nThis work is focused around discovery. It is about exploring the space of the algorithm, shedding light on its many forms, and sometimes finding artifacts of the real world embedded within them.\n\nTechnically, this work is a composition of three primary elements: Voronoi tessellations, orthographic projection, and the depth-sort algorithm.\nThe latter of these is integral to the rendering mechanism. It works intuitively, drawing distant objects before near objects, evaluating the distance of each object according to its geometric center. It does this precisely, and in doing so, it can produce interesting visual artifacts, drawing some shapes in an unexpected order.\n\n\n\nThis has been a fascinating study, bringing light to unreal shapes and forms, and uncovering artifacts in an impossible space.\n\nI hope you enjoy it,\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Notes:\n- Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier.

            "description": "Action; system is an experimental study inspired by the work of François Morellet. Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",
