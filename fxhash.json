            "description": "Monad 1960 is a collection of generative artworks created using JavaScript code, inspired by the generative art movement that emerged in the 1960s. Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of basic modules, or 'monads', that are combined and transformed through an algorithmic process to generate a unique generative artwork.\n\nIn philosophy, the term 'monad' was used by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz to describe the basic and indivisible unit of reality. In generative art, the term 'monad' refers to the simple elements that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create artworks.\n\nPioneers of generative art, such as Vera Molnar, Michael Noll, and John Whitney, experimented with the use of algorithms to generate artworks. These artists developed computer programs and mechanical systems that used simple patterns and shapes to create complex and dynamic artworks. In this context, 'monads' became the fundamental building blocks of these generative artworks.\n\nIn the Monad 1960 collection, programming and algorithmic design are used to generate unique artworks that reflect the principles of the generative art movement. Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of 'monads' that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create a unique generative artwork, exploring the relationship between the simplicity of the 'monads' and the complexity of the resulting generative artworks.\n\nFeatures:\n8 background colors.\n8 canvas sizes.\n45 types of number groups that create different paths for the algorithm.\n\nThe animation lasts 30 seconds, so I recommend waiting until it finishes before downloading the artwork.\nPress \"S\" to download the image.\n\nCreated by Fernando Cabral.",

            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

            "description": "The second piece in this series is dedicated to another fundamental algorithm in computer graphics: Voronoi. It's origin precedes its use with computers by several decades, or centuries, depending on who to credit, since science always is a continuum. In the generative art & design field, the algorithm has been an instrumental tool for generation(s) of practioners, sadly often to the point of turning cliché.\n\nIn this piece I've attempted to \"break\" the classic resulting aesthetics of this algorithm and focus more on revealing its inner workings. There are many ways of computing a Voronoi diagram. The so called Jump Flood Algorithm (JFA) proved to be the visually most interesting approach to me. Again, as with the previous De/Frag piece, here the algorithm has been slowed down, timesliced and customized in dozens of ways to result in a more painterly character overall and produce a variety of new shapes & textures.\n\nFullscreen compatible (Press 'S' to toggle square frame).

            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free.

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

And collectors with their family and friends, what may be an additive process of joy is now perhaps exponential. Joy to the power of 26 to be exact. \n\nIn this work I invite my friends and collectors to collaborate with me. Though not in coding, but together in a process of creating narratives and visuals. Code and story. We didn’t use github, just a simple p5.js editor to try out different programs and palettes. Pedrofe and J0rdan pick their palettes tastefully and carefully. okeoke, perhaps more of a genius than he lets on, picks his palettes blind. No hex color picker. Just straight up rhymes.  \n\nIn our discussions verbal language was forbidden. Only emojis were allowed to express our tastes and views. Each emojis put down on google doc was taken with absolutely seriousness. \n\nPedro: Loves to taking his daily walks on “Magic Mushroom Mountain”\n\nJ0rdan: Wonders about “Quark Question Quiches”\n\nOkeoke: Just get lost in “Finnegans’ Flower Fields.”\n\nIt has been a great joy to present our illustration book A24Z, 8 more than you know who. Each page expresses the alphabet with the best of our knowledge in semantics and sarcasm. Collect just 1 page, collect the alphabets that spell out your name, collect the whole A to Z. Read it to your children or loved ones. Though you might need to interpolate or extrapolate with great imagination which children all have. But most importantly, like all children, have fun!\n\nPress 1 to save png, only for Chrome, not Safari.

            "description": "Every artist and collector feels the joy of both creating and collecting. But if I could share the joy of creating with collectors. And collectors with their family and friends, what may be an additive process of joy is now perhaps exponential. Joy to the power of 26 to be exact. \n\nIn this work I invite my friends and collectors to collaborate with me. Though not in coding, but together in a process of creating narratives and visuals. Code and story. We didn’t use github, just a simple p5.js editor to try out different programs and palettes. Pedrofe and J0rdan pick their palettes tastefully and carefully. okeoke, perhaps more of a genius than he lets on, picks his palettes blind. No hex color picker. Just straight up rhymes.  \n\nIn our discussions verbal language was forbidden. Only emojis were allowed to express our tastes and views. Each emojis put down on google doc was taken with absolutely seriousness. \n\nPedro: Loves to taking his daily walks on “Magic Mushroom Mountain”\n\nJ0rdan: Wonders about “Quark Question Quiches”\n\nOkeoke: Just get lost in “Finnegans’ Flower Fields.”\n\nIt has been a great joy to present our illustration book A24Z, 8 more than you know who. Each page expresses the alphabet with the best of our knowledge in semantics and sarcasm. Collect just 1 page, collect the alphabets that spell out your name, collect the whole A to Z. Read it to your children or loved ones. Though you might need to interpolate or extrapolate with great imagination which children all have. But most importantly, like all children, have fun!\n\nPress 1 to save png, only for Chrome, not Safari.

This is due to the resolution difference between the capture module and the live code on your device. \n\nPlease get in touch in the event of a blank preview thumbnail. \n\nMade in p5.js and rendered in webGL. Tested on Chrome and Safari.\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2022 Thomas Noya\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n◉_◉ ",
