We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "Help us spread “Whirled Peas!”\n\nWhirled Peas is a never-before attempted take on NFT (Non Fungible Tokens), but unlike NFTs that have come before, this will be a collective effort to raise money for vulnerable Ukrainian women, LGBTQIA+ people, and disabled refugees who are displaced and endangered by the war as part of the GISH “Change A Life: Ukraine” charity initiative to benefit Legacy of War Foundation and Random Acts.\n\nThis collaborative art piece by Misha Collins and Shawn Kemp is being unleashed into the NFT community as part of GISH (the Greatest International Scavenger Hunt), which runs from July 30 - Aug 6. Minting is open to GISH participants only via rolling whitelist spots through August 6, 2022, but after minting, anyone can purchase a Whirled Peas NFT. After the GISH Hunt ends August 6, 2022 at 10 PM PDT, all additional editions will be burned and no additional art will be generated, so there will be limited numbers of this art piece available.\n\nGISH participants will need the support of the fxhash community who understand how generative art works and who have a few tez(ꜩ)  to donate to the cause, so if you want to help, please find a #WhirledPeas GISH player on social media, hook them up with a few tez(ꜩ) and help them learn about minting on fxhash. \n\n100% of the mint and 25% of each secondary sale (the maximum portion allowable on the platform) goes to our charity initiative (minus gas and platform fees). Additionally, we ask that anyone collecting this NFT through the week of August 6 do so as a part of our charity campaign and, on your honor, promise to donate 100% of your profits to this charity initiative as well by transferring it to the charity wallet (tz2SBWGZn7mf4UxoPv6tD1HM3sVvFx2EWKtA). Then, re-list it to keep it circulating to help vulnerable Ukrainians — kind of like a virtual game of hot potato, but with NFT art. After August 6, we welcome you to buy and sell it as you normally would, though we still hope you donate some or all of your profits to the cause. Of course, we can’t control what sellers down the chain choose to do, but we are grateful for your support of this charity initiative. Thank you for helping us to help Ukrainians.\n\nLearn More - https://alleditions.art/p/whirled-peas",

            "description": "\"Herbarium\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022\n\nOccasionally, I stumble upon vintage scientific illustrations on various topics, exotically looking charts and graphs, alternative layouts for the periodic tables or psychological research diagrams, elaborate illustrations of botany and zoology, minerals, and natural and sometimes unnatural phenomena. Most of those illustrations are part of the \"art and science\" practices from the 18th and 19th centuries. At the core of those practices were observation and interpretation, unraveling complexity through visualizing abstract ideas or finding a creative approach for understanding previously incomprehensible forms. \n\nI'm an admirer of two female pioneers in the field. Maria Sibylla Merian created, with immense dedication, a book with intricate illustrations of plants and insects, later praised by scientists. On the other hand, Anna Atkins published a book with beautiful botanical cyanotypes, considered the first book with photographic images. These topics are the visual inspiration for pieces presented at ArtBasel HK. \n\nMy mathematical background makes me naturally attracted to graphs, converting numbers to curves, and everything schematically displayed. Also, combining scientific symbols and illustrations with imaginary data inspires the spectator to find meaning in unrelated or random things or provokes latent skepticism towards assumed concepts of truth, reality, and knowledge.
