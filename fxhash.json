            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

It's a unique blend of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" and the unpredictable nature of AI-generated visuals.\n\nHuxley's dystopian vision always struck a chord with me, especially in today's rapidly advancing technological landscape. I saw parallels between his world and the way generative art evolves - both shaped by their environments, reflecting fears, hopes, and the inherent chaos of their times.\n\nBut what really fascinated me was how human touch still played a role. Much like the characters in \"Brave New World\" wrestling with destiny, the AI visuals in my work, though algorithmically birthed, were guided by my hand. They're not just a reflection of the text but a response to it, engaging in a dialogue that goes beyond mere replication.\n\nThis isn't just a generative token; it's a question, a conversation. It's my way of exploring where we stand at this crossroads of art, literature, and technology. In crafting this piece, I found myself wondering, what does our Brave New World look like? How do we balance the precision of code with the fluidity of human emotion? And in a world increasingly dictated by algorithms, where do we fit in?\n\nI invite you to join me in this exploration. Let's unravel the tapestry, decode the symbols, and discover what it means to be human in a world where art and AI coalesce.\n\n- Press \"T\" to save the text contained within the composition, derived from it´s specific chapter \n- Press \"S\" to save a .png of the composition",

            "description": "'follow my lead' is a visualization of three communities of individuals, and the ways in which they interact with each other.\n\nUsing an implementation of a physarum slime mold model, I create three distinct groups of homogenous individuals, with each group having different sentiments towards the others. Individuals within a community make their best effort to follow each other around, and depending on group preferences try to either move towards or away from those in other groups.\n\nAll of these interactions take place on a simulated three dimensional landscape (that varies by token), with groups of individuals having a preference towards either moving uphill or downhill.\n\nEach group begins with a different spatial distribution, such that the extent of exposure to others can change over time.\n\nFor more details on the slime mold implementation and a link to the github repo containing the code, see the accompanying fx(text) article.\n\n\nAnimation\n---------\nThis is designed first as a static piece. The final image consists of running 300 steps of the algorithm and then stopping.\n\nHowever, I have also exposed a couple of ways to watch the image evolve over time. It should be noted that for some outputs, the image will eventually degenerate as we go well past the initial 300 frames.\n\nKeys:\n- space: Pauses/unpauses the animation\n- 'F': Fresh start - reloads the page and animates the first 300 frames, pausing when finished (or append &fresh=true to the URL)\n- 'A': Animate - reloads the page and animates in perpetuity (or append &animate=true to the URL)\n\nWebGL\n-----\nThis piece makes heavy use of shaders/WebGL. I've put quite a lot of time/effort into trying to ensure things behave identically across different browsers/hardware. I've managed to get things to the point where I was consistently seeing identical outputs on the set of hardware available to me. However, there is still a risk that on other hardware specs, things will not be identical. Furthermore, it is the nature of this project that even very small differences in calculations can become exaggerated after multiple steps of the algorithm, leading to larger differences in the final result.\n\n\nReferences:\nJeff Jones's Physarum paper: https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579\nSage Jensen's post on Physarum, which was my first exposure to it: https://cargocollective.com/sagejenson/physarum\nColor names generated using coloraze: https://github.com/evansque/coloraze",
