It builds on the tradition of ASCII and typographic art, blending dithering techniques with chunky, pixelated glyphs. Here, the movement and blending of color is interpreted as a monochrome composition of recognizable pixel patterns taken from legacy video games and operating systems. What appears as typography is actually a custom set of 8x8 pixel patterns rendered in a GLSL shader that produces a conceptual tension between low-res graphics and high-power GPU computation.\n\nPRINTERS is designed to be both viewed on a screen and printed on office paper with a home/office inkjet printer.\n\nPress 'i' to invert the colors.\nPress '1', '2', or '3' to scale the bitmap glyphs.\nPress 'g' to download a looping animated GIF (90 frames).\nPress 's' to capture a single frame.\nPress 'f' (or double tap in mobile) to stretch to full screen.\nMade with vanilla javascript and GLSL.

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\"Swarmachine\" is the closest thing to a useless machine that actually works. \nIn this dichotomy, a swarm of sensitive automatons can be seen carrying out complex cooperative work of misunderstood utility. From a strange coordination, the micro-square society builds its habitat. Influenced by each other, they relate from a sonorous dance. And this is how the swarm lives and reveals -finally- the essence of its own machinery: vestiges and ephemeral moments before leaving.\n\n4 main audiovisual gestures of sonorous dance:\n1. Basic loop\nEach square performs quadrangle movements. It begins and ends at the same point accompanied by a sound.\n2. Contact moment\nAppears when a square reaches a corner of its path and makes contact with another square.\n3. Gesture kamikaze-release\nSometimes these \"contact moments\" result in an impact between the two squares in question, transforming both into a single gesture of fusion, and subsequent release of the swarm.\n4. Queen loop\nAppears when the queen is sighted. Main square that keeps the essence of the machinery.\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js. All sounds are synths programmed in the tone.js library.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens —created in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco— that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking “what if” questions such as “What if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?” Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road —one direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature— it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario’s thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",

            "description": "FSM is a visual grid-system based on autopoiesis, the principle of self-organization through self-reproduction central to cybernetics. At the heart of FSM is a computational mechanism, a finite-state machine (FSM), which generates sequences of visual outputs by activating particular agents and cycling them through varying sets of configurations.\n\nThe grid-system in FSM is segmented along three axes: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. This segmentation constitutes the machine’s parametric space.\n\nCertain agents and configurations are programmed to appear exclusively in specific grid segments, illustrating a principle of spatial distribution.\n\nSimilarly, spatial distribution is mirrored by temporal distribution. Specific agents and configurations are set to emerge at predetermined time intervals. This interplay turns FSM in a self-organizing system living on the blockchain.\n\nThe underlying grid of the animation is responsive. Try to change your window size to get different aspect ratios and grid configurations. On the project page you'll find a tool to adjust some parameters via queries components.\nPlease visit: http://fsm.julian-h.de for more information\n\nCONTROLS\n[f] To enter fullscreen mode\n[spacebar] Play or pause the animation\n[s] Export current frame as a PNG\n[g] Capture a small GIF\n[G] Press once to start capturing a GIF and press [G] again to stop the capture process.\n\nCreated using p5.js and GLSL.\n\nJulian Hespenheide, 2023",

For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",
