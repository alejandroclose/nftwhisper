            "description": "There’s beauty in simple things. Sunlight. A reflection on a puddle. The flight of a bird. Observing the clouds. Spending time with loved ones.\n\nTo celebrate the re-opening of fxhash, I'd like to contribute with some simple thing to enjoy among friends who rejoin after some time.\n\nSimple things is a piece that is just that: simple things. Nothing fancy here. Simple circles doing simple movement, with simple colours. Maybe the viewer will rejoice in observing them transit on the screen.\n\nIt has some controls: you can press “s” to save a png file. You can set a higher resolution pressing “d” followed by 1-9 to increase pixel density (if you get a black image, press “d 0” and start again with a lower number). Simple controls.\n\nIt has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n\nThe pieces exhibit simple variations: palettes, circle sizes, density of elements, backgrounds. The colours might be inverted sometimes. The direction of the movement changes also in some pieces. Some are grayscale pieces.\n\nJust like in life, enjoying simple things is sometimes enough to leave behind the noise and our worries. Also like in life, if one wants something extra, they may get it by looking for it...\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade in p5.js, and glsl for the image controls.",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution. I tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge / Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iPhone, but please make sure it works on your device before minting.\n\n-----\n\nPossible features:\n\ncolor scheme: cairngorm, alborz, bardenas, atlas, bieszczady, watkins\n\nproportions: square, wide, standard, narrow\n\nframe: none, vignette, bright, dark, bright with vignette, dark with vignette\n\nvisitors: tourists, tourists and birds, solitary flock of birds, only light\n",

            "description": "\"What would an ocean be without a monster lurking in the dark? It would be like sleep without dreams.\" ‒ Werner Herzog\n\nMythological monsters like Leviathan, Tiamat, and Lotan have long inspired awe and fear in people’s hearts. I was inspired by these sublime monsters and wanted to evoke their haunting and otherworldly presence.\n\nFor this project, I used creative coding techniques to simulate the methods of monotype printmaking. This medium allows for a fluid and expressive approach to art-making perfectly suited for my vision of these mythological monsters. With this work, I’m bringing these ancient legends to life in a contemporary form, exploring their enduring power and beauty by combining modern techniques with one of the oldest forms of visual art. \n\nMy goal is to arouse a sense of wonder and mystery, using color and abstract shapes to conjure up visions of these legendary monsters from the abyss. Whether you see them as terrifying beasts or beautiful creatures of legend, one thing is clear - these monsters will always remain part of our collective imagination.\n\nFeatures:\n-6 Types of Monsters (Leviathan, Lotan, Tiamat, Aspidochelone, Hydra, Charybdis)\n-3 Frame Styles (Portrait, Landscape, Square)\n-10 Color Palettes\n-Hidden Jewels of the Sea",

            "description": "'Intricated 4x4' was one of the projects that took me the longest to develop. With each WIP, I realized that I could improve some detail, some feature looking for more pleasant, democratic and varied aesthetic results.\n\nThis work consists of generating four sets of particles (ellipses or squares) that appear in the four corners of the screen, respecting the predefined margin limits. These sets move towards the center following an attenuated decrease in size thanks to the combination of logarithm and mapping of frameCount and the size variable. This simple trick ensures smoother and less aggressive movements, bringing the observer a sense of tranquility. \n\nCombining the use of different palettes with some movement conditionals - functions back() and go() - and a charming touch of shading and depth, 'Intricated 4x4' can be considered one of my favorite \nworks and I hope it will be for you, after the mint.\n\nPalletes carefully chosen =)\n\n_______________________________\nVariability of editions is ensured by:\n* 8 background colors\n* 13 palettes x 4 colors = 52 colors picked one by one with a lot of care\n* possibility to have a fantastic BW version (rarity: 5%)\n* possibility to repeat the same palette for both sets (rarity: 8%)\n* possibility to have squares intead of circles (rarity: 25%)\n* a wide range of Shapes number\n* a well thought number of frames, proportional to the total frameCount to make things 'softer'\n\n_______________________________\nInteractive instructions:\n* Press [S] to save your .png file\n* Press [P] to play/pause your animation anytime you like (this increase exponentially your possibilities, right!?)\n\n_______________________________\nCreator: Kukuti\nMay 2022\nLicense: NFT 2.0",

If you need a bigger image, zoom out and refresh, the canvas will fit the window.\n\nPhysics is fundamentally idealist. We search for simple rules from which the complexities of the universe emerge. But real systems are exceptionally complex, closed-form solutions are the exception. The deeper we dive into the fundamental nature of the universe, the less clear the rules become. Are the rules we've developed fundamental, or are they empirical approximations?",

Using this angle between successive ribbons means that as they spiral outwards, they end up distributed evenly around the center. The Golden angle is visible in many plants, not just the sunflower, since it helps prevent leaves from shading each other. (\"Fibonacci phyllotaxis\")\n\nPhi, the Golden angle, and Fibonacci numbers generally have many fascinating, unexpected, and beautiful mathematical and geometric relationships.

Spending time with loved ones.\n\nTo celebrate the re-opening of fxhash, I'd like to contribute with some simple thing to enjoy among friends who rejoin after some time.\n\nSimple things is a piece that is just that: simple things. Nothing fancy here. Simple circles doing simple movement, with simple colours. Maybe the viewer will rejoice in observing them transit on the screen.\n\nIt has some controls: you can press “s” to save a png file. You can set a higher resolution pressing “d” followed by 1-9 to increase pixel density (if you get a black image, press “d 0” and start again with a lower number). Simple controls.\n\nIt has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n\nThe pieces exhibit simple variations: palettes, circle sizes, density of elements, backgrounds. The colours might be inverted sometimes. The direction of the movement changes also in some pieces. Some are grayscale pieces.\n\nJust like in life, enjoying simple things is sometimes enough to leave behind the noise and our worries. Also like in life, if one wants something extra, they may get it by looking for it...\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade in p5.js, and glsl for the image controls.",
