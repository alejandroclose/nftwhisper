            "description": "Tis the season to celebrate and what better way than with a collectible series of 2022 generative ornaments. Perfect for yourself or as gifts for people you love. \n\nDesigned to be printed or plotted and then cut out and hung on your tree or any other place that needs a little festive cheer. \n\nI’ll be picking a few of my favorite outputs and sending the token owners special limited edition signed laser cut versions of their ornaments. \n\n———————\n\nLIVE MODE FEATURES\n- L prepares it for plotting or cutting\n- S exports a layered SVG\n- P exports a PNG\n- 1-9 plays with color combos\n\n———————\n\nFor years my family has collected Wallace Silver Candy Cane ornaments. Each Christmas the kids open up that years design and add it to the tree. With my daughters mostly grown, we now have quite the collection of dozens of ornaments from all the years. Each one full with memories and emotions. \n\nThis series is inspired by that tradition, starting with 2022, and continuing with a new release each year. I hope you enjoy this series and it brings much delight and joy to you, your family, and friends this holiday season. ",

            "description": "1) INTRO (MUST READ)\n\"Emotions\" is a unique Animated, watercolor or liquid painting-like abstract generative artwork which incorporates some \"innovative\" or unique techniques and approaches.\n\nIf find the above too selfish or wonder if its worth to buy this sh**t in a relative high price from an unknown \"artist\" please give some time to read the whole description. You will not regret!\n\nI don't like to talk about myself or using marketing expressions, however sometimes have to, in order to clarify some points & spot some important features\n\nAll started as an exercise to shaders on Nov. 2022 and is the completion of this experimentation (rotating colors): twitter.com/Uniray_net/status/1587588272842280961 \n\n\n2) SHORT BIO\nI was always between graphics & programming. Was very good in both areas (as my teachers were saying) & remember me also drawing from childhood \nThe first years i was focusing more in graphics (i was teaching graphics as well) and i was programming graphics for hobby\n\nFrom 2005 & later i started a turn in my career & made programming my profession for the last 13-14 years (developer in some private companies)\nIn 2020 I started again a more serious involvement with graphics without knowing anything about NFTs or WEB3. And from 2021 i started getting more & more involved. Still so many to learn\n\nI am new in gen art, started few months ago with plain javascript.\nStarted learning p5js in Aug. 2002 and shaders in Oct. 2022 & \"Emotions\" is my first \"large\" work. \nAlready published some simpler & old works (eg. 3D) & things i developed as i was learning\n\n3) FEATURES\nI think i am presenting something relatively different with \"Emotions\" & always try to apply one of my favorite motto: \"Lead, don't follow\"\n\nThe general experience in programming & the fact that i had already programmed graphics in conjunction with my love for experimentation & searching behind the things, helped me to incorporate in \"Emotions\" some \"innovative\" i believe features & techniques (it sounds selfish but let me explain)\n\n- First i am \"proud\" of the shader work. I developed completely custom \"advanced\" techniques that discovered after experimentation & some knowledge of course.\n\n- \"Emotions\" includes 51 palettes (with several color each) that have been stored externally (in the application folder) as Adobe \".act\" color table files so that avoiding hard coded (including all palettes in the code) consuming in this way resources eg. memory from user's system. I just load only the one palette i am going to use\n\n- A fast svg Convolution kernel Matrix filter along with a displacement filter used for the texture\n\n- Lastly & minor, you can switch Orientation (Portrait, Landscape, etc) & Resolution with the press of a key (no need to manually add params in the url)\n\nFrom the above the most important part is the webGL shader.\n\n4) CONCLUSION\n\"Emotions\" is an animated watercolor painting-like (or liquid pigments material) abstract \"live\" work, that instead of staying static, starting with an initial state & slowly flowing, changing shapes & colors as sometimes happens with our emotions & feelings which may changed over time. \nColors also represents emotions eg. red is for passion, green is the color of hope, etc \n\nGive some time to observe the progress and liquid feel and motion in shapes and colors.  Relax and look the flow and color diffusion - spread  & the whole \"painting\" to transformed slowly. \n\nKEYS:\n- 1-4: Set resolution from 1x to 4x of the current dimension (slower performance in higher values)\n- T: Texture on/off\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait (default). Aspect ratio 0.75\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape with ratio 4/3\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ between orientations\n\n- Spacebar: animation on/off\n\nMOUSE:\n- Click: animation on/off\n- Move: left - right on canvas (when in animation) to interact\n\n----\nMade with p5js & custom shaders. Pure code. No Images used\n\n© Dec. 2022  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

            "description": "1) INTRO (MUST READ)\n\"Emotions\" is a unique Animated, watercolor or liquid painting-like abstract generative artwork which incorporates some \"innovative\" or unique techniques and approaches.\n\nIf find the above too selfish or wonder if its worth to buy this sh**t in a relative high price from an unknown \"artist\" please give some time to read the whole description. You will not regret!\n\nI don't like to talk about myself or using marketing expressions, however sometimes have to, in order to clarify some points & spot some important features\n\nAll started as an exercise to shaders on Nov. 2022 and is the completion of this experimentation (rotating colors): twitter.com/Uniray_net/status/1587588272842280961 \n\n\n2) SHORT BIO\nI was always between graphics & programming. Was very good in both areas (as my teachers were saying) & remember me also drawing from childhood \nThe first years i was focusing more in graphics (i was teaching graphics as well) and i was programming graphics for hobby\n\nFrom 2005 & later i started a turn in my career & made programming my profession for the last 13-14 years (developer in some private companies)\nIn 2020 I started again a more serious involvement with graphics without knowing anything about NFTs or WEB3. And from 2021 i started getting more & more involved. Still so many to learn\n\nI am new in gen art, started few months ago with plain javascript.\nStarted learning p5js in Aug. 2002 and shaders in Oct. 2022 & \"Emotions\" is my first \"large\" work. \nAlready published some simpler & old works (eg. 3D) & things i developed as i was learning\n\n3) FEATURES\nI think i am presenting something relatively different with \"Emotions\" & always try to apply one of my favorite motto: \"Lead, don't follow\"\n\nThe general experience in programming & the fact that i had already programmed graphics in conjunction with my love for experimentation & searching behind the things, helped me to incorporate in \"Emotions\" some \"innovative\" i believe features & techniques (it sounds selfish but let me explain)\n\n- First i am \"proud\" of the shader work. I developed completely custom \"advanced\" techniques that discovered after experimentation & some knowledge of course.\n\n- \"Emotions\" includes 51 palettes (with several color each) that have been stored externally (in the application folder) as Adobe \".act\" color table files so that avoiding hard coded (including all palettes in the code) consuming in this way resources eg. memory from user's system. I just load only the one palette i am going to use\n\n- A fast svg Convolution kernel Matrix filter along with a displacement filter used for the texture\n\n- Lastly & minor, you can switch Orientation (Portrait, Landscape, etc) & Resolution with the press of a key (no need to manually add params in the url)\n\nFrom the above the most important part is the webGL shader.\n\n4) CONCLUSION\n\"Emotions\" is an animated watercolor painting-like (or liquid pigments material) abstract \"live\" work, that instead of staying static, starting with an initial state & slowly flowing, changing shapes & colors as sometimes happens with our emotions & feelings which may changed over time. \nColors also represents emotions eg. red is for passion, green is the color of hope, etc \n\nGive some time to observe the progress and liquid feel and motion in shapes and colors.  Relax and look the flow and color diffusion - spread  & the whole \"painting\" to transformed slowly. \n\nKEYS:\n- 1-4: Set resolution from 1x to 4x of the current dimension (slower performance in higher values)\n- T: Texture on/off\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait (default). Aspect ratio 0.75\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape with ratio 4/3\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ between orientations\n\n- Spacebar: animation on/off\n\nMOUSE:\n- Click: animation on/off\n- Move: left - right on canvas (when in animation) to interact\n\n----\nMade with p5js & custom shaders. Pure code. No Images used\n\n© Dec. 2022  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "Initial conditions are stated, and then the particles set in motion - the root of generative art. My goal with this piece was to create an illustration that seemed to be from an earlier (or perhaps later?) time; not, at any rate, our current moment. The background is a very subtle gradient; then it is heavily stippled, and followed with a particle system to create more subtle texture. (Look for the very small \"hairs\" in the background; they are more obvious on the dark ones. They are a subset of the main particle system.) \n\nFollowing that, the main particle system is run in real time; I like to \"show my work\" for generative pieces, as any collector of my previous mints knows, and this is no exception. \"Run\" your mint for an animated drawing experience. Note that fxpreview() hits a few frames before the end of the full run. I did it this way to ensure a consistent preview. As a result, the preview and the final image will be slightly different, only because the final image has a slightly longer lifespan. \n\nThere are multiple \"special\" modes, each with a 10% likelihood: \n\n\"spiral\" will rotate the canvas as the particle system is running.\n\"chaos\" uses random X/Y vectors during the acceleration phase, rather than X or Y.\n\"occasionals\" adds random large particles in an opposing color.\n\nIn addition, there are three possible shapes:\n\n\"circle\" draws circles for the particles.\n\"square\" draws squares for the particles.\n\"jagged\" draws mostly circles, with a 0.01% chance of a square at a 45 degree angle. \n\nFinally, there is a non-attribute feature, where the entire piece is drawn at a 45 degree angle. This has a 20% likelihood, but is only apparent on pieces that have no special, or the \"occasional\" special. Working the math out, you have a 16% likelihood for getting a piece at a noticeable 45 degree angle. \n\nAll main colors have an equal likelihood, but the light background is only 20%. ",
