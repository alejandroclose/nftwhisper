            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "\"I can’t avoid the intellectually most compelling interpretation of ruins that Walter Benjamin attributed to the graphics of Paul Klee, Angelus Novus. In his Theses on the Philosophy of History he creates an allegory where the angel is heading forward but with his back first, because he is looking into the past, onto ruins and the storm that is pushing him forward. Today, it seems we face the opposite situation. It appears to me that ruins threaten us from the future. Yet we cannot go back to the past.\" (Václav Janoščík, Speculative Ruinology)\n\nModular Ruinology is an immersive installation that explores the idea of ruins and decay in a contemporary context. The project is inspired by the concept of modular architecture, where the use of prefabricated and interchangeable components allows for endless possibilities in design and construction. In this project, the modular approach is applied to the notion of ruins, creating a deconstructed landscape of decay that invites visitors to explore and engage with the space.\n\n\"The allegorithm of the game points to the ruins of a topology that is always supposed to arrive from the future but never comes\" (McKenzie Wark, about the video game \"Rez\")\n\nThanks to YulikolaY for getting the code ready for production.\n\nMade with love, AI and p5.js code\n\nMarch, 2023",

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px). It may last for high numbers.\nWe recommend the use of Chrome browser in order to render properly the texture.\n\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 × 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.net",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

So why not set this up as a derivative project at a friendly discount on my alt account?  While I have made tweaks from the base code for this project, I have not spent the extremely detailed amount of time as I have on A Simple Fail.  There will be outputs that will have muted color compositions.  Many will love these minimal outputs.  But, if you hate one of these special mints, just let me know and I'll be happy to purchase the token back from you within reason and for a limited time.\n\nI'm not publishing this project with an intention of burning down from the initial mint number.  This isn't a project to get rich on.  I only hope that it is one that you and the community will find great delight in collecting!  \n\nPlease have fun with A Simple Test!\n\nI will publish this project as disabled so I can test a few outputs.  If all goes well, I'll schedule the project for opening on a later date.\n\n\n===== Interactions =====\n\n{A}dapt to screen size\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{G}rain switch\n{H}ighlight switch\n{Z}oom switch\n{1-6} Save at x multiple of screen size",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "===== A Simple Test =====\n\nThis project started as a harmless way to test mint outputs with varying aspect ratios in preparation for an upcoming project that I've spend several months on which will be called A Simple Fail and will be released on my main fxhash account: https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/bfos.art\n\n<Read more about A Simple Fail @ https://www.bfos.art/projects/a-simple-fail>\n\nI quickly realized how much I would love to collect these mints. So why not set this up as a derivative project at a friendly discount on my alt account?  While I have made tweaks from the base code for this project, I have not spent the extremely detailed amount of time as I have on A Simple Fail.  There will be outputs that will have muted color compositions.  Many will love these minimal outputs.  But, if you hate one of these special mints, just let me know and I'll be happy to purchase the token back from you within reason and for a limited time.\n\nI'm not publishing this project with an intention of burning down from the initial mint number.  This isn't a project to get rich on.  I only hope that it is one that you and the community will find great delight in collecting!  \n\nPlease have fun with A Simple Test!\n\nI will publish this project as disabled so I can test a few outputs.  If all goes well, I'll schedule the project for opening on a later date.\n\n\n===== Interactions =====\n\n{A}dapt to screen size\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{G}rain switch\n{H}ighlight switch\n{Z}oom switch\n{1-6} Save at x multiple of screen size",

            "description": "This is a constantly changing artwork. Keep in mind that each time you reload your iteration or resize the canvas, even though your preferred parameters stay the same, the appearance of the artwork changes!\n\nIf you know my series ZEITSTRUDEL you might recognise similarities. ZEITSTRUDEL is about capturing movement patterns. Everything is actively or passively moved by dynamics and interaction. Everything follows rules. Crawling insects, a flock of bird or fish, leaves on the surface of water, grass in the wind, etc.\nDAI simulates these movement patterns and extends the natural models with abstract digital capabilities.\n\nTwo visual elements produce different outcomes:\n1. The dots themselves draw traces of their path\n2. Lines between the dots: I bet you did some string art back in elementary school :)\n\nHow does it work:\nA random number of dots with a random amount of movement are placed on the canvas. They sense dots in a given radius. They attract or repel each other and they flock together, or not. They draw their movement path and/or their connection to neighbouring dots. Doing all that they paint a more or less beautiful, chaotic, colourful picture. \nYou will mint an iteration based on a given set of parameters. Your mint will always have that set of parameters. However the movement and so the drawing is completely random. Every time you load your minted iteration it will look different. The longer you run an iteration the more it gets painted over and over and over (at least in most cases.)\n\nSome iterations build up with high speed. Some require patience because they build up slowly. Some might even get to a halt and don’t develop any further. Some are delicate, some are bold. Some dots escape beyond their set borders, most don’t. Some colors are piercing your eyes, some shine subtly.\n\nFurther random features you will only know after minting:\n* You start with visible Lines and/or Dots, you can always switch modes with your keyboard\n* Dot size: a weighted size representation of the actual mass of the dot\n* Rainbow: This is a rare feature of 10% probability. Switch between rainbow and your selected color palette with [c]\n\n\nYou have some keyboard functionality:\n\nSwitch modes\n[1] reset and show only lines\n[2] reset and show only path\n[3] show lines and path, don’t reset\n\n[r] reset current drawing without reloading\n[p] pause for admiration \n[b] let the dots bounce off of the border or let them pass through\n[o] switch border around artwork on/off\n[f] switch flocking on / off  (If a piece got stuck and nothing is moving anymore, try to switch flocking. Often it will kick some Dots out of its’ gravity trap.)\n[c] if you are lucky owner of a rainbow you can switch it off to show the color-palette beneath\n\n[s] save the current screen as png ATTENTION! The current image will reset!\n(since DAI is dynamic you can only save your current screen resolution. Redrawing in higher resolutions would create different results) \n[i] toggle info box\n[Right arrow] - cycle through the color palette to set different background colors - the current drawing resets\n\n\nHave fun exploring DAI\n\n\n————\nMade with p5.js\n————\nApril 2023\nby M.Schulte \nTwitter: @cryptEMES",
