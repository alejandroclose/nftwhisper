            "description": "Welcome to the ultimate pico_punk generator! This interactive token is a parameter based generator that creates unique pico_punk generators. Each one will generate one pico_punk with a number of layers chosen by you during the parameter selection phase. Additionally, you can use the buttons to navigate the generative space, and create your own pico_punks via an interactive process of discovery. This is the final pico_punk generator I intend to make, with the extra capabilities added by the parameter selection process, and the final tweaks and changes I made to the appearances and effects, I think this project is now as complete as I can ever make it.\n\nThe controls:\n- arrow keys: move through the generative space... each step adds one layer to the composition\n- x button: take a screenshot of the generated pico_punk\n- o button: clear all layers except the current one (clean slate for building a new pico_punk)\n\nEach layer has a chance to apply one of various visual effects, which vary in how transformative (or disruptive) they are.\n\n\npico_punks began as a project to create something akin to DOS Punks, but fully generative, without any manual intervention or pre-rendered components, using only the Pico-8 Fantasy Console. You can find the first generator here: (https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/439049). In this early version, the generator was interactive, but each pico_punk was totally isolated, being generated from one unique seed and one consistent process. Over time, this evolved to this final experience: one in which the \"curator\", the user exploring the generator, is not just choosing from an infinite number of punks, but actually the process of exploration itself is modifying the output before your eyes.\n\npico_punks is all about exploring themes of irreversibility, noise, pattern recognition, pareidolia, and of course identity. What began for me as something bordering on satire, has become an integral part of how I represent myself online. It is my sincere wish that with these tools you are also able to create something unique that you feel represents you, and is something that couldn't have been made without you.\n\nThank you so much for these last couple years of support, and here's to many more making and collecting art together :)\n\n\nNotes on minting: \n- 30% of royalties go to the minter\n- 10% of royalties go to previous curated pico_punk holders\n- One reserve spot is generated for each curated pico_punk held, and they stack\n- One extra reserve spot is for my Mom",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

It links a thousand pairs of points, harmoniously shifting across the canvas, with delicate lines. At each intersection of these lines, color is applied. To produce the final piece, multiple layers of varying colors and intensities are superimposed.\n\n------\n\nControls:\n\n- [x] Save a PNG\n\n- [1] Set height to 768\n- [2] Set height to 1152 \n- [3] Set height to 1536 (default)\n- [4] Set height to 2304\n- [5] Set height to 3072* \n- [6] Set height to 6144*\n- [7] Set height to 9216*\n- [8] Set height to 11520*\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render height\n\n\n* images with height over 3000 pixels render without animating, downloads a PNG automatically after rendering\n\nPlease note that high resolution outputs will take several minutes or even longer to render.

            "description": "This work was inspired by Otsu-e(大津絵), a Japanese painting in the Edo period. Otsu-e were inexpensive paintings made as souvenirs. Although mass-produced using paper stencils, the artisans painted by hand, resulting in variations in the quality of their work. Connoisseurs found them interesting and collected them as works of art. Otsu-e showed a new value of beauty in Japanese art, different from Ukiyo-e (浮世絵) which are prints, and from fine art paintings which are one-of-a-kind artworks.\n\nThis work is made of canvas2D Bezier curves. Not just a combination of parts, but also a random displacement of the Bezier curve points to lose the shape. This is intended to create fun with the Otsu-e-like effect.\n\n\nFeatures:\nThis profile is made up of 8 parts (brows, eyes, nose, mouth, ear, contour, hair, and body). Each part has 100 basic types. \nThere are 7 skin colors and 12 kimono colors. Each RGB value of the colors is randomly added within a range of ±10. In addition, there are 70 kimono patterns. \nThe distortion rate due to displacement of Bezier curve points is 0.0~50.0. \n\n\nBTW The title \"Henoheno\" is taken from the Japanese character picture \"Henohenomoheji\" known since the Edo period.",

Some features were added to increase the visual and behavioral complexity of the system.

            "description": "This work was inspired by Otsu-e(大津絵), a Japanese painting in the Edo period. Otsu-e were inexpensive paintings made as souvenirs. Although mass-produced using paper stencils, the artisans painted by hand, resulting in variations in the quality of their work. Connoisseurs found them interesting and collected them as works of art. Otsu-e showed a new value of beauty in Japanese art, different from Ukiyo-e (浮世絵) which are prints, and from fine art paintings which are one-of-a-kind artworks.\n\nThis work is made of canvas2D Bezier curves. Not just a combination of parts, but also a random displacement of the Bezier curve points to lose the shape. This is intended to create fun with the Otsu-e-like effect.\n\n\nFeatures:\nThis profile is made up of 8 parts (brows, eyes, nose, mouth, ear, contour, hair, and body). Each part has 100 basic types. \nThere are 7 skin colors and 12 kimono colors. Each RGB value of the colors is randomly added within a range of ±10. In addition, there are 70 kimono patterns. \nThe distortion rate due to displacement of Bezier curve points is 0.0~50.0. \n\n\nBTW The title \"Henoheno\" is taken from the Japanese character picture \"Henohenomoheji\" known since the Edo period.",
