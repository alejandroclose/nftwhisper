            "description": "- \"Whip Into Shape\": A Metaphor for Achieving Justice and Equality -\n\nThe expression \"whip into shape\" has wide-ranging implications that go beyond individual objectives and can be used in more generalized societal and cultural contexts. In light of complicated and urgent challenges including climate change, social inequality, and political division, the entire society may need to \"whip into shape\" in order to address these problems and find answers. This calls for teamwork, perseverance, and a shared dedication to ideals like justice, sustainability, and compassion.\n\nWhipping into shape an organization or institution can refer to creating accountable and transparent processes of governance to make sure individuals in positions of authority behave in the best interests of their constituents. This calls for a readiness to address dishonesty and unethical behavior while placing an emphasis on openness and justice. We may make sure that the institutions that run our society serve the interests of everyone by \"whipping\" these institutions into shape.\n\nLastly (?), \"whipping into shape\" can be used to describe addressing damaging or outmoded cultural practices and ideals. A commitment to communal discipline and effort is required to advance issues such as racial justice, environmental sustainability, and gender equality. It involves affecting people's hearts and minds, pressing back against deeply rooted notions, and committing to a more just and equal society.\n\n-----Controls---------------------\nPress 'f': to change the background color to any other color in the palette.\nPress 'g': to change the background to white.\nPress 'h': to change the background to black.\nPress 'j': to change the background to default color.\nPress 'k': to change the background color to a gradient.\n\nPress 'o': to generate a flower.\nPress 'p': to return to normal.\nPress '[': to increase the transparency of the background (same effect as 'o' or 'p' but can be controlled).\nPress ']': to decrease the transparency of the background (same effect as 'o' or 'p' but can be controlled).\n\nPress 'q', 'w': to randomize the color.\n\nPress 'a': to decrease the size of the cursor to conceal (or potentially reveal) shapes. \nPress 'd': to increase the size of the cursor to conceal (or potentially reveal) shapes.\n\nPress 'z': to display hidden shapes under the cursor faintly.\nPress 'x': to display shapes outside the cursor's radius faintly.\nPress 'c': to hide shapes outside the cursor radius.\n\nPress 's': to save\nMouse click: to create something cool.\n----------------------------------",

            "description": "- \"Whip Into Shape\": A Metaphor for Achieving Justice and Equality -\n\nThe expression \"whip into shape\" has wide-ranging implications that go beyond individual objectives and can be used in more generalized societal and cultural contexts. In light of complicated and urgent challenges including climate change, social inequality, and political division, the entire society may need to \"whip into shape\" in order to address these problems and find answers. This calls for teamwork, perseverance, and a shared dedication to ideals like justice, sustainability, and compassion.\n\nWhipping into shape an organization or institution can refer to creating accountable and transparent processes of governance to make sure individuals in positions of authority behave in the best interests of their constituents. This calls for a readiness to address dishonesty and unethical behavior while placing an emphasis on openness and justice. We may make sure that the institutions that run our society serve the interests of everyone by \"whipping\" these institutions into shape.\n\nLastly (?), \"whipping into shape\" can be used to describe addressing damaging or outmoded cultural practices and ideals. A commitment to communal discipline and effort is required to advance issues such as racial justice, environmental sustainability, and gender equality. It involves affecting people's hearts and minds, pressing back against deeply rooted notions, and committing to a more just and equal society.\n\n-----Controls---------------------\nPress 'f': to change the background color to any other color in the palette.\nPress 'g': to change the background to white.\nPress 'h': to change the background to black.\nPress 'j': to change the background to default color.\nPress 'k': to change the background color to a gradient.\n\nPress 'o': to generate a flower.\nPress 'p': to return to normal.\nPress '[': to increase the transparency of the background (same effect as 'o' or 'p' but can be controlled).\nPress ']': to decrease the transparency of the background (same effect as 'o' or 'p' but can be controlled).\n\nPress 'q', 'w': to randomize the color.\n\nPress 'a': to decrease the size of the cursor to conceal (or potentially reveal) shapes. \nPress 'd': to increase the size of the cursor to conceal (or potentially reveal) shapes.\n\nPress 'z': to display hidden shapes under the cursor faintly.\nPress 'x': to display shapes outside the cursor's radius faintly.\nPress 'c': to hide shapes outside the cursor radius.\n\nPress 's': to save\nMouse click: to create something cool.\n----------------------------------",

(...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

It represents an attempt to capture some of the shapes, textures and nuances typical of hand-made drawings through algorithmic means. \n\nIt is a continuation of the exploration initiated with my previous work “The Likeness of a Flower”, a generator of expressionist flower paintings.\n\nStrongly inspired by the astonishing work of British artist Claudia Lowry: https://www.instagram.com/claudialowry_art/\n\n100% code – no assets. Made with p5.js.\nThis work is animated.\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 1000 x 1000 resolution.

It represents an attempt to capture some of the shapes, textures and nuances typical of hand-made drawings through algorithmic means. \n\nIt is a continuation of the exploration initiated with my previous work “The Likeness of a Flower”, a generator of expressionist flower paintings.\n\nStrongly inspired by the astonishing work of British artist Claudia Lowry: https://www.instagram.com/claudialowry_art/\n\n100% code – no assets. Made with p5.js.\nThis work is animated.\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 1000 x 1000 resolution.

Gradually that project morphed into this strange hybrid of indie posters, zodiac killer messages and what AI might do to the whole thing. If it were unleashed on it. This collection - I prefer to call my art a collection - includes some palettes inspired by influential fxhash projects as well as mixes of my own.\n\nThemes here can be pretty dark. I've struggled with suicidal ideation in the past and while it seems like it might be a faux pas to put the words suicide and death in these works, I felt I needed to stay true to me and the darkness that tends to walk side by side with the sunny man I often appear to be.\n\nIf you struggle with similar issues, please go and speak to someone. It has helped me immensely.\n\nfxhash asked everyone to try and make some donations to worthy causes.\n\nI chose Processing Foundation - since their code work has been so helpful to this community. And to Tezos Ukraine. Because the war there goes beyond the borders of Ukraine and the outcome will have an impact on our global society. If Putin were to succeed... Well he won't with our help.",

            "description": "fxhash turns one\n\nWorking with text on GEN XYZ Das Occult led me to fooling around with an ascii type project while I worked on those pfps. Gradually that project morphed into this strange hybrid of indie posters, zodiac killer messages and what AI might do to the whole thing. If it were unleashed on it. This collection - I prefer to call my art a collection - includes some palettes inspired by influential fxhash projects as well as mixes of my own.\n\nThemes here can be pretty dark. I've struggled with suicidal ideation in the past and while it seems like it might be a faux pas to put the words suicide and death in these works, I felt I needed to stay true to me and the darkness that tends to walk side by side with the sunny man I often appear to be.\n\nIf you struggle with similar issues, please go and speak to someone. It has helped me immensely.\n\nfxhash asked everyone to try and make some donations to worthy causes.\n\nI chose Processing Foundation - since their code work has been so helpful to this community. And to Tezos Ukraine. Because the war there goes beyond the borders of Ukraine and the outcome will have an impact on our global society. If Putin were to succeed... Well he won't with our help.",
