            "description": "'Part:Counterpart' is an experiment in form, disintegration, and context. Each work is created within one of three modes, Part, Counterpart, or Part:Counterpart.\n\nIn experimenting, I've enjoyed taking a simple composition and breaking it down with various methods. This transforms the original composition into something new, but it also begins to lose what the original had to say. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I want to dive a little deeper and explore ideas as a sort of tangible substance. Already we're comparing ideas against their translations and evolutions, but what happens if we present them both within the context of the other?\n\nAdditionally, what if we present both of these ideas with echoes and tangents, discussion around the ideas and their practical applications instead of imagined? Sure, these aren't our idea, or even our translation, but they exist only because the originals do.\n\nHow does this change our opinion of the original? Is every idea destined to be picked apart and reimagined forever until it bears only a faint resemblance? Where is the line between our Counterpart and an echo?\n\nThis piece hopes to inspire contemplation on the nature of storytelling and artistic inspiration.\n\n10% of ideas are encrypted to obscure the original Part.\nPress ’s’ to save a 3600x4500 png.\nPress ‘p’ to save the original Part, pure and untouched.",

Outputs are made up of arrangements of squares in various compositions, yet within that we are free to imagine what they could mean. For some, the resulting shapes might represent DNA strands or atoms. Others might see cells or the building blocks of the hereditary instructions that shape us as individuals. \n\nA generative genetic report accompanies each output to spark the imagination and attempt to attach further meaning to each composition. Some gene sequences carry mutations, however not all mutations are visually apparent. Please refer to the fxhash features to view the reports accordingly.\n\nTexture is used subtly, so for maximum enjoyment it is recommended that you save and view your outputs at full size in order to best enjoy the details.\n\nPress 'S' to save a 2400 x 3396 px PNG file.",

            "description": "INSPIRATION\n\nSpirali was inspired by Tyler Hobbs' work with flow fields. However, instead of selecting random starting points for each shape to be drawn, which is more usual in flow fields works, I wanted to constrain the starting points to certain positions so that the shape being drawn could expand freely without the risk of colliding with other shapes, that's when I got to the spiral flow field.\n\nWHY SPIRALI?\n\nThe name of this collection is not only a direct translation of spirals in Italian, but it is also related to Italian cuisine and my own personal experience in Italy. The relationship with Italian cuisine is due to the immense number of types of pasta that exist, including one called spirali. When I was a child I only knew three or four types of pasta, but when I became a bit older I was amazed to learn that there were many more. Actually, there are hundreds. Just like from the same type of basic dough, you can make hundreds of types of pasta, my idea was, from just one type of spiral flow field, to make hundreds of images. A strategy of forcing creativity by imposing a major constraint.\n\nThe name of this collection also relates to my personal experience because it was visiting Italy many years ago that I first became interested in art and design because of the beautiful buildings, churches and works of art that I came across.\n\nDESIGN STRATEGY\n\nA spirali is made up of several tails and each tail is made up of a basic element, which I called slice. A tail may have from one to thousands slices. It is mainly the variation in the number of slices and how they are colored that creates the different tail styles in each spirali.\n\nThe slices start at the center of the spiral and in each iteration they grow a certain length or split in two depending on the parameters used in the algorithm, which also determine the outline and fill of each slice when it is rendered.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe main features that a spirali can have are:\n\n- Styles: Refers to the drawing patterns of each tail, that means, the shape, fill and stroke of the slices that form the tail. There are about 16 possible styles from which the algorithm will choose about 3 for each spirali.\n\n- Zoom out: It is related to how much larger the flow field area is in comparison to the image area. There are two possibilities: 50% and 100%.\n\n- Curvature: An arbitrary measure of the rate the tails of a spirali are turning. A spirali can have high or low curvature.\n\n- Rotation: The rotation direction: clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n- Tails: The number of tails in a spirali.\n\n- Palette: The palette's name. There are about 14 possible palettes.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n\n- Press \"m\" to export a medium resolution image (2000px x 2000px);\n- Press \"h\" to export a high resolution image (6000px x 6000px);\n\nLICENSING\n\nPlease see license.txt file.\n\nTwitter: @PauloSilvaGArt\nSite: https://paulosilva.art",

Each work is created within one of three modes, Part, Counterpart, or Part:Counterpart.\n\nIn experimenting, I've enjoyed taking a simple composition and breaking it down with various methods. This transforms the original composition into something new, but it also begins to lose what the original had to say. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I want to dive a little deeper and explore ideas as a sort of tangible substance. Already we're comparing ideas against their translations and evolutions, but what happens if we present them both within the context of the other?\n\nAdditionally, what if we present both of these ideas with echoes and tangents, discussion around the ideas and their practical applications instead of imagined? Sure, these aren't our idea, or even our translation, but they exist only because the originals do.\n\nHow does this change our opinion of the original? Is every idea destined to be picked apart and reimagined forever until it bears only a faint resemblance? Where is the line between our Counterpart and an echo?\n\nThis piece hopes to inspire contemplation on the nature of storytelling and artistic inspiration.\n\n10% of ideas are encrypted to obscure the original Part.\nPress ’s’ to save a 3600x4500 png.\nPress ‘p’ to save the original Part, pure and untouched.",

(Please note that no images or video will be saved or sent anywhere, as all processing occurs locally on your machine.)\n\nI had originally planned to use my own color palette extraction algorithm, as I wrote one myself a while back, but then I discovered Lokesh Dhakar's wonderful open source \"Color Thief\" JS library (github.com/lokesh/color-thief), which does a better (and quicker) job, and so it became this project's sole dependency.\n\nrossgoodwin.com",

            "description": "Inland Emotions\n\nOver the centuries, ancient philosophers and modern psychologists have come to the same basic conclusion. The fact is that, according to a few millennia of research, there are a limited number of distinct human emotions, predefined by the human psyche. Sometimes it may seem like we are experiencing a \"new\" one, but on closer inspection, we see that it is the known emotions that are superimposed. Emotions are what they are, and they exist in the same way in each of us, whether we recognize them for what they are or not. But as our history blends into a new emerging state of the world, a whole new range of emotional responses are triggered within us. An infinite maelstrom of variations generated from a simple combination of a few emotions.\n\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nInland Emotions by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

But maybe it's a good trap, because it gives you the opportunity to make your own way and gives you your own will. After all, there is a possibility that outside this cage your individuality is erased, because you become a small part of some big one whole. The gloomy grid on top of the canvas symbolizes that trap (cage), bright or dark geometric figures (only circle, rectangle, triangle are used randomly) under it are our souls.\n\nKyiv, 08.2022.",

Each work is created within one of three modes, Part, Counterpart, or Part:Counterpart.\n\nIn experimenting, I've enjoyed taking a simple composition and breaking it down with various methods. This transforms the original composition into something new, but it also begins to lose what the original had to say. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I want to dive a little deeper and explore ideas as a sort of tangible substance. Already we're comparing ideas against their translations and evolutions, but what happens if we present them both within the context of the other?\n\nAdditionally, what if we present both of these ideas with echoes and tangents, discussion around the ideas and their practical applications instead of imagined? Sure, these aren't our idea, or even our translation, but they exist only because the originals do.\n\nHow does this change our opinion of the original? Is every idea destined to be picked apart and reimagined forever until it bears only a faint resemblance? Where is the line between our Counterpart and an echo?\n\nThis piece hopes to inspire contemplation on the nature of storytelling and artistic inspiration.\n\n10% of ideas are encrypted to obscure the original Part.\nPress ’s’ to save a 3600x4500 png.\nPress ‘p’ to save the original Part, pure and untouched.",

            "description": "Redols is a piece about the automated arrangement of geometrical shapes in space and how the images generated can foster different moods. It visually investigates how to adjust the amount of randomness and repetition -both in the code loops and in the visual composition- to create structures that contain the mere essence of geometry and of movement.\n\nIt explores the repetitive use of a simple geometric shape: the circle. Adds some counterpoints to enhance it: squares, lines, and triangles which are found in the background. It focuses on circular shapes, not always drawing exactly. They change their core, their measure, the color, the gradient, or some subtle details. The arrangement uses an elliptical distribution and replicates some shapes to promote the visual recognition of bigger parts thus enhancing the movement feeling.\n\nRedols is my genesis piece at fxhash curated by VerticalCrypto Art and Anika Meier.\nExhibited at IN TOUCH: art in the age of post-nftism show at Dekabinett, Berlin, september 2022.\n\nRedols means circular shapes, not perfect ones, in Catalan and is an investigation of how deterministic processes and algorithms can create appealing arrangements that foster non machinic agencies and sentiments.\n\nThe piece is created by code, coding it from scratch, mixing, and mastering basic drawing techniques. This approach pays attention to the art piece getting old -I hope well- and makes it easier to show and view it on different computers and platforms to prevent its obsolescence.\n\nI tested on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Mac OS, Ubuntu, Android, and iPhone in vertical and horizontal mode, but please check it works on your device before minting.\n\n----\npossible features:\n- colors:  super fosc marro, super blau, taronja-marro, taronja-blau, marro-taronja, marro-blau, blau-taronja, blau-marro.\n- fons: quadradets, escaires, diagonals.\n- fonsple: true, false.\n- redols: equilibrat, mironia, migmig, degradats, vespa, mandarina, us, os, pla.\n- fons2diagonals: true, false.\n\nAnna Carreras 2022",

In this series, urban ensembles are generated with a simple click. With each iteration appears a new densely built city block. Graced with impeccable geometrical lines, devoid of any human presence, these buildings remind us of brutalist utopias like Le Corbusier’s Cité radieuse or Niemeyer’s Brasilia. But despite their clearly modernist feel, there is something hauntingly primitive about them. They could be either New Mexican adobe pueblos, Minoan palaces, or Turkish troglodyte dwellings. Both carved and sculpted, these Ghormenghasts of concrete float in a realm out of time, like in some architect’s dream.\n\nThe purpose of this creative work is to generate 3D architectural projects that could be implemented in the real world. The accelerating lives that we live, complicated by growing and unpredictable environmental crises, call for an enhanced capacity to come up quickly with new architectural solutions adapted to different contexts. From computer assisted design to 3D printing, from augmented reality to real-life housing, from sculpture to architecture, this work aims at bridging the gap between the virtual and the tangible.\n\nWorking as a visual artist, David Umemoto draws inspiration from his training as an architect. He has been using low-tech methods for a long time, refining his talent for elegant simple shapes and combinatory constructions. Now, poured concrete and home-made moulds are giving way to zero-gravity rotating models. The skills he developed while working with real objects find a new playground in the virtual realm.\n",

            "description": "'Part:Counterpart' is an experiment in form, disintegration, and context. Each work is created within one of three modes, Part, Counterpart, or Part:Counterpart.\n\nIn experimenting, I've enjoyed taking a simple composition and breaking it down with various methods. This transforms the original composition into something new, but it also begins to lose what the original had to say. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I want to dive a little deeper and explore ideas as a sort of tangible substance. Already we're comparing ideas against their translations and evolutions, but what happens if we present them both within the context of the other?\n\nAdditionally, what if we present both of these ideas with echoes and tangents, discussion around the ideas and their practical applications instead of imagined? Sure, these aren't our idea, or even our translation, but they exist only because the originals do.\n\nHow does this change our opinion of the original? Is every idea destined to be picked apart and reimagined forever until it bears only a faint resemblance? Where is the line between our Counterpart and an echo?\n\nThis piece hopes to inspire contemplation on the nature of storytelling and artistic inspiration.\n\n10% of ideas are encrypted to obscure the original Part.\nPress ’s’ to save a 3600x4500 png.\nPress ‘p’ to save the original Part, pure and untouched.",
