The artwork consists of a grid of cells that serve as the basis for the lines and points generated by the algorithm. The colors used in the piece vary, with a 10% chance of using pure white or pure black, and the remaining colors drawn from a selection of bright and bold hues. The lines are randomly generated, with each line beginning and ending at a point on the grid, and the thickness of each line varying based on the size of the cell. The result is a mesmerizing and abstract composition that invites the viewer to get lost in its intricate patterns and dynamic energy. \"Cellular Lines\" is an intriguing exploration of the relationship between order and chaos, and a striking example of the potential of generative art to create beauty through algorithmic randomness.\n\nRoyalties will be split with the minter, 50/50",

            "description": "Tranquil Orbits: A Journey Through Calming Vortices, Ethereal Motion, and Meditations in Color\n\nIn the vast expanse of darkness, there lies a singular point of gravity, the anchor orb, a celestial body gently cradling smaller orbs in its embrace. The Tranquil Orbits project emerged from a fascination with the subtle dance of these heavenly bodies, bound together by invisible forces, their motions guided by the gentle hand of nature.\n\nThe journey of discovery for Tranquil Orbits began as an exploration of the organic nature of celestial movement. An observation of the night sky, with its infinite depth, stirred within a desire to capture the essence of this cosmic ballet. The art project took shape as a series of generative artworks, each a solitary color set against the black canvas of the void.\n\nIn this serene landscape, the anchor orb serves as a steadfast guide, providing a sense of stability in the midst of constant change. As the smaller orbs revolve around their celestial guardian, they appear to whisper secrets of the universe, sharing tales of worlds unseen and mysteries untold.\n\nThe Tranquil Orbits project is a quiet testament to the beauty of discovery, an invitation to wander through the cosmic expanse, and an ode to the ever-changing dance of celestial bodies. It is not a grandiose proclamation of artistic prowess, but rather a humble exploration of the intimate connection between the observer and the cosmos, where the lines between creation and observation blur and intertwine.\n\nIn the end, Tranquil Orbits is not solely about the final product, but rather the process of discovery, the joy of creation, and the subtle dance between order and chaos. It is an invitation to lose oneself in the infinite possibilities of the cosmos and to find solace in the tranquility of the celestial dance.\n_____________________________________________\n\nThe entire project is developed using Vanilla JS. It features a black canvas and a palette of 24 distinct colors, with one color assigned to each artwork. The artworks exhibit diversity in several aspects, such as the quantity and radii of orbs, the landscape, variations in orb textures, and some rare occurrences like eclipses.\n\nEach artwork is animated using a recursive algorithm, where the large orb gently rotates at its center while the smaller orb(s) revolve around it at varying speeds. Users can control the rotational speed of the smaller orbs and alter their rotation direction. Although each artwork has a predefined position for all orbs, users can pause the animation and save the image in any preferred state.\n_____________________________________________\n\nTo interact with the artwork:\n-\tIncrease the rotational speed of the smaller orb(s) by pressing 'u'\n-\tDecrease the rotational speed of the smaller orb(s) by pressing 'd' or to change the direction of rotation. \n-\tThe animation responds to changes in rotational speed, but it may take a few seconds for the effects to become visible. Please wait for the effect to become visible after you press 'u' or 'd'. \n-\tPause the animation by pressing 'f'\n-\tStart the animation again by pressing 'b'\n-\tCapture a 2000 x 2000 image by pressing 'p' (this can be done during both paused and active animation). This will always generate an image with orbs in their current position.\n-\tSave an SVG file by pressing 's'. This will always generate an image with orbs in minted position.\n_____________________________________________\n\nretr0metr0, San Francisco, March 2023. \nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0.",

These pigments are arranged in multiple layers, each layer using a different color from one of the carefully curated color palettes. Each palette consists of three to five colors. \n\nAs the pigments are shifted by random noise, new hues and patterns emerge, creating a lovely display of color and movement.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[5] to change the resolution.\n- Press [s] to save a png file at the current resolution.\n\nThis is my first generative art project.

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "Welcome to the ultimate pico_punk generator! This interactive token is a parameter based generator that creates unique pico_punk generators. Each one will generate one pico_punk with a number of layers chosen by you during the parameter selection phase. Additionally, you can use the buttons to navigate the generative space, and create your own pico_punks via an interactive process of discovery. This is the final pico_punk generator I intend to make, with the extra capabilities added by the parameter selection process, and the final tweaks and changes I made to the appearances and effects, I think this project is now as complete as I can ever make it.\n\nThe controls:\n- arrow keys: move through the generative space... each step adds one layer to the composition\n- x button: take a screenshot of the generated pico_punk\n- o button: clear all layers except the current one (clean slate for building a new pico_punk)\n\nEach layer has a chance to apply one of various visual effects, which vary in how transformative (or disruptive) they are.\n\n\npico_punks began as a project to create something akin to DOS Punks, but fully generative, without any manual intervention or pre-rendered components, using only the Pico-8 Fantasy Console. You can find the first generator here: (https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/439049). In this early version, the generator was interactive, but each pico_punk was totally isolated, being generated from one unique seed and one consistent process. Over time, this evolved to this final experience: one in which the \"curator\", the user exploring the generator, is not just choosing from an infinite number of punks, but actually the process of exploration itself is modifying the output before your eyes.\n\npico_punks is all about exploring themes of irreversibility, noise, pattern recognition, pareidolia, and of course identity. What began for me as something bordering on satire, has become an integral part of how I represent myself online. It is my sincere wish that with these tools you are also able to create something unique that you feel represents you, and is something that couldn't have been made without you.\n\nThank you so much for these last couple years of support, and here's to many more making and collecting art together :)\n\n\nNotes on minting: \n- 30% of royalties go to the minter\n- 10% of royalties go to previous curated pico_punk holders\n- One reserve spot is generated for each curated pico_punk held, and they stack\n- One extra reserve spot is for my Mom",
