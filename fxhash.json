            "description": "\"I can’t avoid the intellectually most compelling interpretation of ruins that Walter Benjamin attributed to the graphics of Paul Klee, Angelus Novus. In his Theses on the Philosophy of History he creates an allegory where the angel is heading forward but with his back first, because he is looking into the past, onto ruins and the storm that is pushing him forward. Today, it seems we face the opposite situation. It appears to me that ruins threaten us from the future. Yet we cannot go back to the past.\" (Václav Janoščík, Speculative Ruinology)\n\nModular Ruinology is an immersive installation that explores the idea of ruins and decay in a contemporary context. The project is inspired by the concept of modular architecture, where the use of prefabricated and interchangeable components allows for endless possibilities in design and construction. In this project, the modular approach is applied to the notion of ruins, creating a deconstructed landscape of decay that invites visitors to explore and engage with the space.\n\n\"The allegorithm of the game points to the ruins of a topology that is always supposed to arrive from the future but never comes\" (McKenzie Wark, about the video game \"Rez\")\n\nThanks to YulikolaY for getting the code ready for production.\n\nMade with love, AI and p5.js code\n\nMarch, 2023",

There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

            "description": "\"Before the Storm\" captures a fleeting moment of calmness amidst an impending tempest. Heavy clouds loom overhead, suffusing the air with palpable moisture and an alluring aroma. Majestic evergreens stand tall and proud, bravely facing the ominous yet strangely inviting sky. The air crackles with electrifying energy, foreshadowing the raw power of nature about to be unleashed. In this fleeting moment, one cannot help but be mesmerized by the sublime forces at play, but beware, the calm will not last forever.\n\nTechnical Note:\nIf you wish to render a high-quality version of your iteration, I strongly recommend increasing the resolution (press \"R\") and setting anti-aliasing to >1 (press \"A\"). However, be aware that it might take longer to compile and may not render at all on older hardware. To save the image, press \"S\".\n\nThe code has been tested on my old MacBook and on various Windows machines. For best results, use a modern Chromium-based browser, and make sure your browser supports WebGL 2.\n\nsuperbialux",

            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",
