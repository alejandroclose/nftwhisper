            "description": "“Gardens are poems where you stroll with your hands in your pockets.”\n—Pierre Albert-Birot\na Japanese garden seems incredibly poetic. As we walk around such a garden in the flow of the year’s seasons, you may notice the Beautiful girls and women are combing their hair in endless peace with golden and wooden hairpins, colored kimonos, and their shining hair under the everlasting red sun. Fallen camellia blossom, a blade of grass set to swaying by a passing dragonfly; these details inspire poetry. They often inspire a particular genre of poetry known as haiku in Japan.\n\nHaiku seeks to capture these details, these brief moments of keen perception and intuition, recording them so that the poet and reader might share and celebrate their universal authenticity. \nHaiku is often a poetry of nature, but it is also a poetry of human nature. They are feeling and understanding what the poet deliberately left out of the poem so we can figure it out for ourselves. It is the magic of haiku, and Japanese gardens are ideal places to make the most of this magic.\n. Bashō, the great Japanese haiku master, said to “learn of the pine tree from the pine tree and the bamboo from the bamboo.” He meant to ground yourself in the authentic, to be in the present.\n\nIn this collection, which consists of 106 layers of PNG, we have tried to achieve a new combination in the form of etching and relief prints by combining it with modern art and combining it with DOS-style and an attempt to represent the original and ancient art of Japan. Let's deal with these works.\n",

Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

            "description": "I wanted to depict the beauty and movement of ocean currents, inspired by NASA's aerial images of currents leaving and entering the ocean. I combined elements of painting, the release of warm and cool colors and images of twisting and moving ocean currents into creative visual pieces that evoke a sense of the dynamic nature of the ocean.\nEach piece often features vibrant colors and fluid shapes that mimic water's flow to create intricate patterns that resemble swirling currents.\nWith this art form, I not only celebrate the aesthetic appeal of oceans, but also raise awareness of their importance in supporting marine life. Also reminding us of the interconnectedness of our planet's ecosystems in order to motivate us to appreciate and protect our oceans.\nWhether displayed in homes, offices, or public spaces, Ocean Currents will add calm and natural beauty to any setting. It serves as a visual reminder of the power and majesty of the ocean while inviting viewers to reflect on their connection to the natural world.\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",
