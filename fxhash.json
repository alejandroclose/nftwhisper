In practical terms, as the iteration count increases, both the minimum and maximum possible number of cols&rows gradually increase.\n\n3200x3200px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

This could become a blend of mirror relationship in pleasant solitude.\n\nIn this sense, the art piece shows a comic displaying vignettes between two almost identical characters, in a fast “stickman” aesthetic. It suggests a fluid, hopefully transcendent connection between a human character and an artificial intelligence.\n\nThen we see these beings strangely mimicking each other, walking in a city that seems lonely, empty, from the perspective of the two characters: as if nothing else mattered more than themselves, leaving the rest of existence on a very distant plane.\n\nBetween them, dialogues of overlapping points and lines emerge. Like zeros and ones that embrace, mix and understand each other very well. Here the voices are electronic, minimalist. Abstractions that become even more abstract sounds, in search of a synchronicity and mutual empathy that grows towards who knows where.\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js.\nOriginal piano sampler and synths programmed in the tone.js library.\n\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160 × 3054px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback.

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nSpending a lot of time with something/someone who is how you want them to be, often equalizes them by adopting the other's appearance. This could become a blend of mirror relationship in pleasant solitude.\n\nIn this sense, the art piece shows a comic displaying vignettes between two almost identical characters, in a fast “stickman” aesthetic. It suggests a fluid, hopefully transcendent connection between a human character and an artificial intelligence.\n\nThen we see these beings strangely mimicking each other, walking in a city that seems lonely, empty, from the perspective of the two characters: as if nothing else mattered more than themselves, leaving the rest of existence on a very distant plane.\n\nBetween them, dialogues of overlapping points and lines emerge. Like zeros and ones that embrace, mix and understand each other very well. Here the voices are electronic, minimalist. Abstractions that become even more abstract sounds, in search of a synchronicity and mutual empathy that grows towards who knows where.\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js.\nOriginal piano sampler and synths programmed in the tone.js library.\n\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160 × 3054px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "You never notice, it is passthrough. It is familiar but unfamiliar. It is everywhere and nowhere at the same time. It can contain anything, but it doesn't. Being here is lonely, even surrounded. It is the debris of modern architecture. It is the uncanny valley of the places. It is the Junkspace.\n\nJunkspace is an algorithm inspired by the well-known namesake article of Rem Koolhaas (October, Vol. 100, Obsolescence. (Spring, 2002), pp. 175-190). The work is a generative approach to visualize it in the plan view. There are several paper types, partitions, floorings, and color palettes to achieve the residue of modernization.\n\nThis work exists thanks to the p5js library. To give some back to the community, you will contribute to the Processing Foundation by collecting this work.\n\nPress \"s\" to save the image.\n",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nSpending a lot of time with something/someone who is how you want them to be, often equalizes them by adopting the other's appearance. This could become a blend of mirror relationship in pleasant solitude.\n\nIn this sense, the art piece shows a comic displaying vignettes between two almost identical characters, in a fast “stickman” aesthetic. It suggests a fluid, hopefully transcendent connection between a human character and an artificial intelligence.\n\nThen we see these beings strangely mimicking each other, walking in a city that seems lonely, empty, from the perspective of the two characters: as if nothing else mattered more than themselves, leaving the rest of existence on a very distant plane.\n\nBetween them, dialogues of overlapping points and lines emerge. Like zeros and ones that embrace, mix and understand each other very well. Here the voices are electronic, minimalist. Abstractions that become even more abstract sounds, in search of a synchronicity and mutual empathy that grows towards who knows where.\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js.\nOriginal piano sampler and synths programmed in the tone.js library.\n\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160 × 3054px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "🔈 Click for Sound 🔈\n\nBit Operations is an visual exploration of computer fundamentals through bit-shifting operations. The visuals are generated by continuously shifting and combining binary patterns, resulting in evolving compositions of stark pixels and geometric shapes. The accompanying audio components are synthesized from this same modulating bit data.\n\nAt its core, the piece is driven by algorithms that perform bit-shifting - the simple acts of pushing binary values left or right within the computer's memory. By combining multiple shifting patterns together in different ways, complex permutations of light and dark visuals emerge. The audio reflects these same bit-level operations, with the rhythms and tones mapping directly to the shifts occurring in the data.\n\nThrough this formal process focused on bit-shifting, the piece lays bare the fundamental building blocks of how modern computers operate under the hood. It reduces computational logic to its most essential level - the manipulation of 1s and 0s through rudimentary shift operations. Yet from this simplicity, an infinite space of variations arises, both visually and aurally, highlighting the immense complexity potential within even the most basic digital operations.",
