            "description": "The first blueprint was found in 1947 on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.\nIt has been studied several times.\nNumerous theories arose trying to explain its origin.\nNone of them was decided conclusively.\n\nOne year ago, a rare group of waves coming from space was intercepted on earth.\nThis happened during the 2021 summer.\nIt was unclear if they were born from natural events.\nDying stars, black holes... Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n—--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n—--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n—--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022. Madrid - Cadiz. Spain.\nMade with p5.js",

In the rest of the night, the moon will shine in the sky and the position of the moon in the sky will change every hour of the night.\n\nTo see this effect better, you can take a photo of each watch and compare the photos.\n\n- Press “s” to save the current canvas.\n\n* Note: If it is night in your geographical location, you will definitely see the minted pieces with a dark sky with the moon, and if it is day, you will see a bright sky with a random background color with the sun.\n\n--\nArtist: Pointiago\nAug 02, 2022\nLicense: NFT 2.0",

            "description": "Waves and Ripples is an implementation of a continuous CA, where wave like behaviours are obtained from the influence of neighbour cells over the cell itself. Depeding on the connections config for each cell, different patterns will emerge, creating waves, ripples, or a mix of both. When single loop is on, the calculations and drawings are done at once, which makes for a more chaotic visual.\nBest enjoyed in full-screen :) \n\nClick anywhere to restart\n\nFeatures : \n  shrinkFactor : 3 types\n  connectArray: 16 possibilities,\n  extraConnection: 4 types,\n  mutualNeighbour: 40% chance,\n  singleLoop: 30% chance\n  monoChromo:  15% chance\n\nInspired by Matt Pearson's book.",

            "description": "Each monogrid artwork gets initialized with a start up algorithm that builds up a set of rectangles and fills them with pixels. There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Depeding on the connections config for each cell, different patterns will emerge, creating waves, ripples, or a mix of both. When single loop is on, the calculations and drawings are done at once, which makes for a more chaotic visual.\nBest enjoyed in full-screen :) \n\nClick anywhere to restart\n\nFeatures : \n  shrinkFactor : 3 types\n  connectArray: 16 possibilities,\n  extraConnection: 4 types,\n  mutualNeighbour: 40% chance,\n  singleLoop: 30% chance\n  monoChromo:  15% chance\n\nInspired by Matt Pearson's book.",

            "description": "It is a \"Living City\"\n\nThe state of the city sky will change by receiving your current time.\nFor example, if it is morning in your city, the sun will rise in your mint, and if it is night, your mint will be dark.\n\nThe settings are such that at 06:00 in your geographical area, the sun rises and the sky slowly brightens, and at 19:00 in your geographical area, the sky darkens and the sun sets. In the rest of the night, the moon will shine in the sky and the position of the moon in the sky will change every hour of the night.\n\nTo see this effect better, you can take a photo of each watch and compare the photos.\n\n- Press “s” to save the current canvas.\n\n* Note: If it is night in your geographical location, you will definitely see the minted pieces with a dark sky with the moon, and if it is day, you will see a bright sky with a random background color with the sun.\n\n--\nArtist: Pointiago\nAug 02, 2022\nLicense: NFT 2.0",
