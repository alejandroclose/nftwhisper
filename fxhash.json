With a global tempo typically set in days, we fit all sorts of temporal structures where our joys and fears live and play out over the span of our lives.

            "description": "Summer Daydream is the final chapter in a nature trilogy that I've worked on throughout 2023. The inspiration comes from both the superbloom in California this spring, and the carefree summer vacations of my childhood. I used to live close to a beautiful woodland in northern China, with a willow-lined creek filled with lotus and water lilies. I spent many long summer days playing in the woods with my friends, pretending to be explorers, detectives, martial arts masters, and more ... back then I only dreamed of the future, and now I sometimes dream of the past. Things as small as the taste of a hawthorn berry or the fragrance of a pagoda tree would pull my mind back to that simpler time. I can't remember the shape of the creek or the paths we took, yet the colors are still vivid as new, and they bring me a sense of happiness and peace. \n\nThe artwork is best viewed in full screen mode in a Chrome browser. \n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.09\n\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is based on the width of the browser window.\n[j] Save a JPEG image of the live view, default resolution is based on the width of the browser window.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 1.78 (16/9)]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1.33]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n&res=[output size of the long edge]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

            "description": "There is a place in a remote village with only forest and huge meadows and hills around it. I used to spend a few days there in the summer. This year it has become my retreat for the whole summer. There is silence around and no persistent explosions from the bombing. I wanted to use this time to relax and reflect.\n\nWhen I began working on the project, I had no specific goals in my mind. I didn't set myself any tasks, didn't commit to any deadlines. Suddenly, I found something that reminded me of blooming meadows, it was in tune with my state at that moment. So I started to develop this theme. I did not aim to turn it into a realistic picture. The images were supposed to remain abstract, just to convey the general mood and impressions I was feeling.\n \nInitially, it was a story about summer meadows and grasses. But in the process, I had memories of impressions that arose in different seasons, which I observed in nature here. Colour became the main conductor of the story about various states of nature. It is common to see a lot of black soil in spring through which fresh shoots break through, creating bright splashes on a dark background. During the early summer, the area is covered in lush grasses and wildflowers, as well as butterflies. The world blooms and life is reborn. Eventually, the grasses wither due to the hot sun. Sun-burnt straw sheaves take on a special beauty and texture.  As autumn approaches, we turn to the terracotta range, which offers a variety of ripe mature flowers. Winter is all about graphics. During this period, I usually like to take black and white pictures. Every time, every state of nature has its own beauty. As well as every period of our life.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nPlease pay attention: for rendering the project you might need a rather powerful CPU. Depending on your equipment, it may take several seconds to several minutes for the process to complete. \n\nThe project was tested on different browsers; it works best in Chrome. Please make sure the project works on your device.\n\nPlease be aware, if you are minting with Safari or Firefox for Mac, a live preview image may differ slightly from a captured image.\n\nThe final resolution of the saved output depends on the size of your browser window. \n\nTo save a high resolution image add &scale=(and then a number from 4 to 12) to the end of the URL when in live mode. For example, &scale=6. \n\nPress ’s’ to save the image.\n\nTo save an output with a density higher than 9 (or resolution more than 4319x7680) use Firefox for PC or Safari for Mac. Please be aware that it might take more time to generate a higher density output even on a powerful computer, so please be patient.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nOlga Fradina (Live Minting Experience at Unit London), 2023\nMade with p5.js and GLSL.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Summer Daydream is the final chapter in a nature trilogy that I've worked on throughout 2023. The inspiration comes from both the superbloom in California this spring, and the carefree summer vacations of my childhood. I used to live close to a beautiful woodland in northern China, with a willow-lined creek filled with lotus and water lilies. I spent many long summer days playing in the woods with my friends, pretending to be explorers, detectives, martial arts masters, and more ... back then I only dreamed of the future, and now I sometimes dream of the past. Things as small as the taste of a hawthorn berry or the fragrance of a pagoda tree would pull my mind back to that simpler time. I can't remember the shape of the creek or the paths we took, yet the colors are still vivid as new, and they bring me a sense of happiness and peace. \n\nThe artwork is best viewed in full screen mode in a Chrome browser. \n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.09\n\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is based on the width of the browser window.\n[j] Save a JPEG image of the live view, default resolution is based on the width of the browser window.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 1.78 (16/9)]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1.33]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n&res=[output size of the long edge]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

J. T. Mitchell discusses the concept of \"digital imagery\" and references a mythological figure, Urizen, who appears in the works of William Blake. Mitchell states:\n\n\"Urizen represents measurement and division, drawing the circumference of the world and delineating the boundaries between light and darkness, serving as the sacred rational architect fundamental to the visible universe.\"\n— \" Image Science: Iconology, Visual Culture, and Media Aesthetics \" Chapter 11, by W. J. T. Mitchell.\n\nFrom William Blake's portrayal of Urizen, I sense a central figure in the creation of the world's myriad forms, one immersed in calculating the incalculable, measuring elusive patterns, and tracing the vortex of ever-flowing boundaries.\n\nIn my view, this represents the ongoing collaboration between humanity and computer today.\n\n▒\n\nIn mathematics, θ (theta) typically represents an angle on a plane. Through calculations involving points, lines, and angles (with the assistance of computers), we can create an almost infinite array of shapes. For me, at this level, θ has become a fundamental metaphor underlying the creation of digital imagery.\n\nIn this artwork 'θ', I attempt to connect the metaphorical aspects of mythology with mathematical calculations, imagining myself as a cartographer of creation, striving to capture the fissures in image generation.\n\nHowever, this also signifies that I cannot create anything outright; I am always an individual trying to master the elusive calculations. Only be continually captivated by the corporeal perception and temporal characteristics of digital imagery.\n\n▒\n\n[Key] commands\n\n〘P〙 - pause / continue drawing\n\n〘S〙 - save image // (keep Drawing)\n\n〘1〙〘2〙〘3〙〘4〙 - get higher res image // (Stop Drawing)\n〘2642x3852〙〘3303x4815〙〘3963x5778〙〘4624*6714〙\n\n▒\n\n[Note]\n\n-The display on mobile devices may vary slightly, and it is recommended to open live view on a computer for the best experience.",

            "description": "In my journey into abstract art, which gazes towards informal art, I've crafted a generative work that combines the complexity of cellular automata (with 33 rules) with an irregular grid, precisely outlined by a particulate flowfield that follows it with a sinuous and captivating movement.\n\nThis artwork, which I've titled \"Abstract Automata\" is an expression of my artistic exploration in delving into the interplay between order and chaos, regularity and irregularity. I've created an irregular grid as the foundation for the piece, intentionally breaking symmetry and linearity, embracing unpredictability.\n\nWhat convinced me to create this comes to life when the artwork is animated through a cellular automata. Colors blend with the grid, giving a sense of homogeneity. Subsequently, a particulate element follows an intricate path within the irregular grid, leaving a trail of colors and moving shapes, forming a visual choreography. Finally, in contrast to the complexity of the previous interactions, there's a 100% abstract particulate. This entity defies all rules and logic, acting entirely freely and randomly. This element adds a touch of mystery and unpredictability to the artwork, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty and wonder.\n\nAs I mentioned, in this artwork, my exploration of informal art translates into an experience where randomness and regularity meld to create a new form of abstract \"beauty.\" The use of cellular automata is because I found them highly fascinating to study and is a clear homage to this marketplace.\n\nTo change the density from 1 to 10 (incorrect results set to 1), double-click the left mouse button.\n\nI used p5.min.js\n\nkisses\nKenzo da barra",
