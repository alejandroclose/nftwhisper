            "description": "“Southern Gothic” is my debut release on the fxhash platform. The project is created entirely through code. All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n“Southern Gothic” borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",

            "description": "The first blueprint was found in 1947 on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.\nIt has been studied several times.\nNumerous theories arose trying to explain its origin.\nNone of them was decided conclusively.\n\nOne year ago, a rare group of waves coming from space was intercepted on earth.\nThis happened during the 2021 summer.\nIt was unclear if they were born from natural events.\nDying stars, black holes... Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n—--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n—--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n—--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022.

            "description": "\"Slice of Life\" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

We're here for our families, our friends, and our community. Like everything in life, there are joyful times and challenging times. We must accept happiness as something that is not constant but that we feel at times (a \"tratti\" in Italian).\n\nWith \"tratti\", we want to send a message to every disheartened human being: \"Stay strong and never let anyone or anything crush the hope in you. Joyful times are around the corner\".\n\n---- \n\n© 2022 — Alessandro Fiore x Emanuele Pasin\nLICENSE.md for detailed licensing info",

            "description": "During the last couple of decades, over the air television signals and antennas switched to digital, bringing with them a new form of static and distortion as the signal is broken up. \"Over the Air\" is inspired by these digital distortions, incorporating aspects of them into the same grid-like structure seen on the television. Additional patterns are combined in the grid with these distortions to create the final artwork.\n\nPatterns for the individual blocks in the grid are divided into categories, and various amounts are picked for each work, with dozens of possible mixtures. Patterns can flow in different directions across the varied canvases. Distribution of these patterns across the grid varies from work to work, providing for different feels as they bunch together or spread apart.",

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

            "description": "This is a work about growth, impermanence and decay. Ghostly plants and flowers grow around an invisible point, but they immediately begin to fade into the dark background and are soon replaced and covered by others. This process of accumulation and disappearance builds an ever-changing floral garland, or perhaps a funeral wreath.\n\nThe monochrome vegetation is part of a fictional flora, born out of random algorithmic combinations, and does not intend to reproduce any real species. It belongs to an “artificial nature” which, like so many worlds that the computers generate for us in movies, games, and virtual reality environments, is a convincing simulation of life, but it is not actually living. AI bots, virtual assistants and non-player characters are also representatives of the uncanny realm of the not-really-alive-but-looking-like-it, which are becoming an increasingly relevant presence in our everyday lives.\n\nThese plants and flowers speak about life as a process of incessant renovation, but also about death as the background that’s always there and makes life possible. This spectral vegetation seems to thrive precisely at the verge between both worlds.\n_______________\n\n\nThis work is animated and will adapt to any screen size. It generates a never-ending ring of algorithmic foliage, which never repeats itself, and is different for each token. The image preview is triggered after the first five plants or flowers.\nMade with p5.js\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture",
