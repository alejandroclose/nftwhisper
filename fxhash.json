So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\nBecause this is an NFT in PFP format, you can put it on your avatar on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nDesigned by: @morteza_yousefy\nMade in 2022",

Add with some onclick variations, you can always find the best possible locations for your flowers and save.\n\nThis project is token of my appreciation to God for blessing us all, with this amazing art surrounding us.\n\nClick on NFT to see the flower dance.\nPress \"S\" to save 1000x1000 png of your mint.\nYou are welcome to request a Hi-Res image for your holdings via twitter @TheRealBotany\n",

Add with some onclick variations, you can always find the best possible locations for your flowers and save.\n\nThis project is token of my appreciation to God for blessing us all, with this amazing art surrounding us.\n\nClick on NFT to see the flower dance.\nPress \"S\" to save 1000x1000 png of your mint.\nYou are welcome to request a Hi-Res image for your holdings via twitter @TheRealBotany\n",
