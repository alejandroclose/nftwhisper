            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

This piece simulates a kind of stigmergy among a large population of particles. Each particle leaves a trail behind it as it moves, and determines its direction of motion based on the trails around it. The rules for how a particle should move based on its surroundings were created with a user-guided evolutionary process.\n\nPress \"c\" to capture a 2048x2048 image of the simulation. You can also press the spacebar to pause/unpause the simulation, and press \"n\" while paused to move the simulation forward a single step.",

The rules for how a particle should move based on its surroundings were created with a user-guided evolutionary process.\n\nPress \"c\" to capture a 2048x2048 image of the simulation.

            "description": "Henge is an exploration of circular megalithic structures of the prehistoric age. It is a work of historical fiction where these stone assemblies, achieved through herculean efforts of stacking, aligning, and balancing immense chiseled rocks, are reimagined within an alternate universe of algorithmic possibility. Historically, henges share a few qualities that inspired this project. First, they are places of gathering within a loose collection of stones to organize ceremony or worship under celestial alignments. They are also monolithic in their materiality and employ the most elemental techniques of megalithic, or large stone, construction. These particular types of henges, known as cromlechs, are circular spaces fit with purpose and ritual and in this sense, serve as precedents to the great human edifices; charging landscapes with meaning and presence through geometry and order. Finally, henges are a collective language of place-making shared across a range of cultures and ages, from the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras and across territories from modern-day Morocco, Portugal, Brazil, Germany, Scandinavia, to the well-known Stonehenge in Great Britain.\n\nThis project is deeply inspired by the timeless and universal narrative created through the thoughtful and deliberate placement of large rocks in a circle. It seems that when confronted with marking a place and communing with nature, human beings like to make circles out of stones. Among all the symbols of place making, the circle is the original and still remains the most universal. Through the use of code to portray these imperfect structures, Henge animates the history of these circles in all their roughness and seemingly endless variation.\n\n\n--------\n\nCreated by Aranda\\Lasch @ArandaLasch\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\nNovember 2022\n\n[Interaction instructions]\n'left' + 'right' arrow keys to change view\n'i' saves a 2048x2048 PNG\n\n[Info]\np5.js\nHenge is optimized for Chrome, runs slowly on Firefox (the longer the wait, the more stones and/or grass are being generated)\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n10% of all primary and secondary proceeds donated directly to Girls Who Code\n",

            "description": "'Murals' is a collection of 256 abstract compositions born out of an intense period diving deeply into street art, pointillism and the inner workings of neural networks.\n\nThe work explores projection, refraction and abstraction of points as they ripple through multi-dimensional space-time. Points refract through multi-dimensional space to become shapes, which then become coordinate systems for the projections of new points that create a sense of form, texture, lighting, and material properties. \n\nThe work is also a celebration of imperfections and how a combination of many tiny – almost individually imperceptibly small – imperfect details can shape our perceptions of form, materiality, mood. This is explored within this work through subtle uses of sprays, flecks, scuffs, cuts, grain, targets (projections of projections), construction lines, base projections, occasional glitches that cause curvature, bounced light, shadows, and more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n15 colour palettes: \nScream, Night Bus, Double Backflip, Jaws, Sunday, Atom, Space, Tipex, \nGraphite, Leaf, Earth, Bubble Gum, Citrus, Jellyfish, Damp Concrete.\n\n4 times of day (that create subtle changes in light colour):\nDaylight, Winter Morning, Midnight, Sunset\n\n2 Border types: \nNormal, Thin\n\nVarious features that subtly impact appearance surface textures and shard forms:\nMetallic, Engrave, Number of Shards, Scuff Marks, Symmetry. \n\nControls:\n- Press [ S ] to save the work at its current image size as a PNG.\n- Press [ 1 ] to set the image size to 1440 x 1944 pixels (default size)\n- Press [ 2 ] to set the image size to 2880 x 3888 pixels\n- Press [ 3 ] to set the image size to 4320 x 5832 pixels\n\n- Press [ F ] to toggle freeform mode to create custom image sizes and aspect ratios\n- Press [ R ] to reload the image (for use in freeform mode)\n\nThis work has been tested on Chrome and Safari on Mac OS, and also using an Android smartphone. Please make sure that it works on your device before minting. Based on testing (in May 2022), each work should take about 5-10 seconds to fully load on a laptop or desktop machine, and 15-20 seconds on a mobile device. The loading process is animated so you can watch the construction the static artwork during this time. \n\nThis artwork is created with p5.js \n\n@nbswwit, 2022\n",
