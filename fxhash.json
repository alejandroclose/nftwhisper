            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution. I tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge / Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iPhone, but please make sure it works on your device before minting.\n\n-----\n\nPossible features:\n\ncolor scheme: cairngorm, alborz, bardenas, atlas, bieszczady, watkins\n\nproportions: square, wide, standard, narrow\n\nframe: none, vignette, bright, dark, bright with vignette, dark with vignette\n\nvisitors: tourists, tourists and birds, solitary flock of birds, only light\n",

            "description": "Diamond Fractal Fire interposes recursively generated poetry with similarly recursive fractal imagery. Each text (unique for each mint, but always 20 sentences in length) is generated by a custom context-free grammar algorithm, fed with lists of words selected by the creator. The fractal pattern in each edition is a variation on a Koch snowflake fractal, one of the earliest fractals described by mathematicians. These fractals grow over time at varying rates, and pulse with varying color ranges using Perlin noise, eventually filling the screen.\n\n\nPush `h` to save high resolution PNG and JPG images of the complete fractal pattern (takes a moment to process)\nPush `s` to save PNG and JPG images of the current browser view (with current browser window dimensions and resolution)\nPush `v` to begin recording canvas as a video (with current browser window dimensions), then push `v` again to save the video\nPush `f` to toggle fullscreen mode\nPush `p` to toggle zoom pause\nPush `r` to toggle zoom reverse\nPush `c` to toggle color shift pause\nPush `l` to toggle low resolution mode (improves framerate)\n\n\nThe animation is somewhat computationally expensive, and so it runs best on contemporary laptop and desktop computers. Mobile devices and older computers may experience low frame rates. Captured video quality may vary depending on compute and browser limitations. The animation is responsive (it will adapt to any screen or window size), and resizing your browser window also will restart the animation.\n\nColor floors and variances represent ranges for Hue using a Hue/Saturation/Brightness (HSB) color model. Velocities represent (subtle) zoom speed differences. Noise increment and start values affect the rate and variation of color shifts.\n\nIn addition to the author's code, Diamond Fractal Fire relies on the p5.js library.",

The higher quality renders are for printing and zooming in to choose your own sub-composition or explore the details/depth. Higher quality images will naturally take longer to render but will be worth the wait. If you find a partial render particularly nice, you can press spacebar to pause (and unpause) the render. Save a PNG by pressing ‘P’ or a JPEG with ‘J’. Medium and high quality renders are optimized for Chrome desktop and may not function on other browsers or mobile devices.\n\nThe processing length varies considerably, depending on the assigned traits. Therefore, not all previews will reflect the final output.\n\ncreated using p5js\n\nClew\nabstractment, 2022",

Intrigued by this challenge, I've delved deep into the pixels of this issue. 🙂\n\nDrawing inspiration from Rev Dan Catt’s 'Tally!' and applying similar principles of Cable Management, I've assembled a fun and free OE project.\n\nThis project dynamically evolves with each iteration.Grid is determined by a random value calculated as follows: the lower bound starts at 3 and increases incrementally with every 100 iterations, while the upper bound starts at 4 and increases with every 30 iterations. In practical terms, as the iteration count increases, both the minimum and maximum possible number of cols&rows gradually increase.\n\n3200x3200px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",
