            "description": "\"Dreamcatcher Forest\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Art Basel, Basel 2022. The illustration in this work draws inspiration from Native American dreamcatchers, a protective talisman crafted from beautifully intricate patterns of woven thread, built from natural materials & colorful beads.\n\nDreamcatchers are used to protect dreamers while they sleep. Good dreams are able to slip through the web to meet the sleeper beneath, while bad dreams are trapped and prevented.\n\n- Use the \"S\" key to save a PNG image.\n- Use the \"P\" key to export a print-quality image.",

            "description": "'Tesseract' is a generative collection drawing on the concept of the cube from oneirology, the interpretation of dreams. In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "Step into the vibrant world of FXHash 2, where art meets innovation! This piece of art is a tribute to the launch, inviting you to immerse yourself in its dynamic visuals.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the realm of the lines, there rested a world overlooked by the atmospheric views of hills, christened as Harmonious Hill. A world, where the sun, the moon, and the stars were born out of infinite circles effortlessly looping. A world that was bathed utterly in monochrome hues of the cosmic palette.\n\nIt was once teeming with life, laughter, and colors before the great apocalypse. A disaster so colossal, that it wiped out all color, replacing it with an eternal melancholy of black and white.\n\nThe Harmonious Hill, though stripped of its vibrancy, stood resiliently against time. The skies were filled with perpetual fog, a reminder of the long-lost days. The vertical and curvy hills, once gliding into vibrant valleys, now housed derelict and deserted towns.\n\nThe Taiga trees, bound by the monochrome, delineated themselves as large silhouettes against the never-ending horizontal line of the sky, whispering tales of the catastrophic past to the lonely artists. The haunting echoes of the past continued to reverberate, ironically absorbed by these mute trees.\n\nAmid the somber monotones, the lone survivors were the birds. Soaring across the gloomy apartment buildings, their elegiac songs spun tales of lost epochs in the cold air, threading through the silent trees and melancholy fog.\n\nOne day, a new phenomenon graced the hills. The everyday circle loop of the sun enlarged, as though trying to consume the sullen world. Fear encapsulated the folks of the Harmonious Hill as they watched the sun spiral, assuming it to be the second apocalypse in line.\n\nIn the foreboding silence, a tiny speck of white emerged from the enormous sun, descending to the sky. As it journeyed closer, the birds serenaded its descent. It was a seed, glowing white and vibrant against the black skies.\n\nUpon reaching the cold ground, it burrowed into the heart of Harmonious Hill. Silence fell once more; the sun receded to its normal loop. Days turned into nights, and nights into days.\n\nThen, in the stillness of a frosty dawn, the seed burst forth from the ice-cold soil. A majestic tree, unlike any Taiga trees, flourished. It sprouted not just leaves, but colors. Colors of hope, resilience, and rejuvenation. It shone vibrantly, piercing through the eternal fog.\n\nThe birds sang, and their melodies turned from dirges to ditties of joy. The people in the houses awoken from their centuries-old slumber, stepping out for the first time into the fresh, thawing world. As they saw the growing tree of colors, they weaved stories of a new beginning, a world reborn.\n\nIn the realm of lines and monochromes, the world of Harmonious Hill thus welcomed hope, banishing its perpetual sadness into a tale of survival and rebirth. The apocalypse became a fable of transcendence, of how desolate lives could burgeon anew, in the miraculous world of art.\n\nTo navigate and interact with the artwork, here are the key controls:\n\nS Key: Press 'S' to save the image content of the current frame. This will capture the artwork without the frame.\n\nG Key: To create a GIF capturing the last 5 seconds of the artwork's movement, simply press 'G'. This will generate a GIF file showcasing the dynamic changes over the last few seconds.\n\nFeel free to explore the artwork and use these keys to capture your favorite moments or visuals!

It’s intended for small-scale print.\n\nAs a kid I was obsessed with Lego, Duplo, wooden building blocks... anything I could make something with.\n\nI’d spend hours building things, imagining new worlds, new machines, new concepts, then i’d take them apart and create a whole new idea to explore.\n\nTo me, this piece to me is a reminder of that time - many days spent exploring ideas with those simple objects - no care for viability, for marketability, for audiences or business. Just pure fun.\n\nWithout this time in my life, I doubt I’d have found my passion for creating in the way I do today.",
