            "description": "\"Slice of Life\" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it.

During this time, I have released more than 160 separate collections. I am also extremely grateful to all collectors, authors, designers and artists whom I met during this time. You are wonderful people. Once again I want to express my gratitude to everyone who minted my work and help financially in such a difficult time. Each coin is very important and has played a critical role in my life.\n\nThis collection has a final cost of 0 XTZ. If suddenly you like the minted work and you want to express your gratitude, you can write to me on Twitter, retweet or mint any other work from my profile. Only at your request.\n\nMade with p5.js ",

It is a comtemplation of the passing of time, the inevitability of change, and the beauty that can be found in impermanence. It is an invitation to reflect on the fluidity of life and our own place within the grander scheme of things. A testament to the resilience and grit required to survive in a constantly changing world. Despite the harsh conditions and ever-present threat of change, the desert sands endure, shifting but not breaking; their beauty and strength undiminished.\n\nMade of several overlapping curved lines, each piece is a depiction of movement and fluidity, symbolizing sands in a constant state of motion. The curves blend and mix, creating new patterns and hues where they overlap, much like the way that life experiences blend and mix to create new and unique outcomes. The uneven distribution of grains across each piece represents timelessness. Areas of low accumulation of grains are a reminder of the years of constant erosion. The sands of time have existed and will exist in a state of constant motion and change for eons, for the lifetime. This way, each piece also evokes nostalgia, as we ponder on our past lives.\n\n“It’s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your life’s story will develop.” ― Dieter F. Uchtdorf",
