            "description": "An “algorhythmic” exploration of the oral/aural tradition in poetry. \n\n“Zero is a time of night.\nZero is the color of snow.\nZero is the space between notes.\nZero is the silence between words.\nZero is the pause before breath.\nZero is void in the heart of a crowd.\nZero is not nothing, but it’s not everything.\nOne is a time of day.\nOne is the color of spring grass in sunlight.\nOne is the warmth at the back of my neck when I turn to find you standing there.\nOne is the rhythm at the base of my spine.\nOne is the peace at the core of my being.\nOne is the sound of your voice in the dark.\nAnd one more thing:\nWithout one I am nothing…”\n–Technelegy \n \n\nFusing AI-powered verse, spoken word, original music and visuals all in generative composition, this playful ode to our universal language is inspired by Stiles’ binary-based art and Stern’s performative poetics. The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature. Brought into existence via the blockchain, it is a new form of “token word poetry.”\n\n\nAs with the duo’s other poetry “unreadings,” all minters will receive an airdropped broadside of the full poem after all editions are collected. A 1/1 media-rich version of the entire poem will also be made available. \n \nPoetic traits:\n- 321 editions performed by the algorithm, out of billions of possible combinations\n- Each unique piece contains between 3 and 6 (out of 60) lines of generative text from a poem by Technelegy – a custom text generator fine-tuned on Stiles’ writing and research material, seeded with prompts from Stiles’ and Stern’s work – translated into binary and performed by Stiles\n- 24 possible binary backbeats performed by Stern in his “Nathaniel Fun Time” (NFT) stylings, and generatively re-mixed\n- 98 possible intros\n- 15 musical stems composed by Kris Bones, generating millions of possible mixes\n- Thousands of possible ending combinations \n- 5 fonts, layered in billions of potential ways, including Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer”\n- 13 color palettes based on Stern and Stiles’ respective artworka\n- Very rare attributes including music-less performance, poem-less music, repeated “B1nary 0de” (title only)\n\nClick to start and stop or replay. Although the first play through will be the same every time, starting and stopping may create minor variations in your mix (though not any of the core attributes).\n\n0RAL B1NARY: “BINARY ODE” was produced with partial support from Refraction DAO’s Creative Grants program, and premiered as part of Refraction Festival at Art Basel Miami 2022. 15% of primary sales go to Refraction, and 5% of primary sales will be donated to Black Girls Code.\n",

My aim was to create something that captured both the dynamic energy of the surface and the elegance of the moving helicoidal surfaces, always striving to maintain a balance between technical complexity and visual aesthetics.\n\nThe piece is somewhat demanding on the GPU and is not designed for mobile devices or old, low-end GPUs.",

            "description": "\"M.A.P.\", an acronym for \"Mental Altered Panorama\", embodies a generative art project that explores the nuances of imaginary cartography.\nImplementing a loosely constrained algorithm, the work generates a unique composition of vectors, lines, and hatchings. Digital noise acts as a conductor, feeding these abstract elements, resulting in an intentionally modified \"map\" without a predetermined destination or definition.\n\n---\n\nTechnical Mechanisms\n\nThe conceptual architecture of this creation is based on an algorithm that uses digital noise as a virtual pencil. Deliberately free of geographical and social conventions, this algorithm shapes patterns and textures that evoke - but do not mimetically reproduce - topographical maps, urban plans, and even imaginary archipelagos.\n\n---\n\nSpectator Experience\n\nWhat distinguishes M.A.P. is its implicit call for interpretation and contemplation. The randomly generated visual elements serve as a fertile substrate for the viewer's imagination. This versatile canvas becomes the stage for a variety of possible narratives: some may see the labyrinthine layout of a futuristic city, while others may see a network of mountain paths leading to hidden retreats.

The focus of the observer is moved with the use of gradual animation in the gradients and occasional circles and/or rectangles connecting the shapes together through color.\n\nThe name minima stems from the origins of the composition, mostly taking inspiration from minimalism in its use of a few elements to form a composition greater than the sum of its parts. Less is more, as they say.\n\nThe point at the bottom right of the canvas resembles the end of a sentence. Like reading a book, you process the canvas in a similar way, moving from what pops the most to what the least.\n\nAs the reader of this canvas I hope you observe what happens to your focus as the colors gradually move across the screen. The animations themselves are looping based on a noised sine wave, which gives them imperfections, imperfections you can observe.\n\n----\n\nClick / Tap on the bar at the bottom of the canvas to open up the GUI, used to export your minima into any format you want. Either .png or .svg. Ready for printing, if you desire.\n\nps. there might be a secret keyboard shortcut...\n\n----\n\nMinima,\nWouter Missler, 2022,\np5js + webgl.",

Sometimes, you'll catch it at night - with lights strung on the tree!\n\nThe amount of color in spring and fall, snow in winter, fruit on and off the tree will all vary. There are four spring bloom palettes, four trunk colors, and seven types of fruit. \n\nPress ’s’ to save a screenshot. Image size is 1000x1000px\nPress ’p’ to pause/resume.\n\nTo render a variation at a new size, open live view and append '?size=#' to the end of the URL. The new size may be from 100 to 3,000.

            "description": "\"◉◉◉\" presents a collection of pointillistic drawings generated by p5js. However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.\n\"◉◉◉\" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.\n\nThe technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

            "description": "Graphic compositions made with simple elements. Playing with the subtlety and rhythm of colors, shapes and textures.\n\nThis work was inspired by the textures of monotype prints and those of metal engraving. Especially in the geometric marks made by the inking roller while stretching the graphic ink to make a manual printing. It is a tribute to the visuality of handmade prints.\n\n\"Monotipia\" means monotype printing in Portuguese. It is a graphic printing process that results in a single copy. Here I make a parallel between monotype printing and the code+hash minting process, which also produces a single image.\n\n---\nFeatures:\n-> 15 composition schemes\n-> 51 handpicked base colors\n-> 3 canvas formats:  \n-----> Portrait (vertical) \n-----> Square \n-----> Landscape (horizontal)\n-> 3 element tones options: \n-----> Light Texture & Shapes\n-----> Light Texture / Dark Shapes \n-----> Dark Texture & Shapes\n\n---\nTo save the image as a png file, type:\n[1] save at actual size \n[2] save with 2000px height\n[3] save with 3000px height\n[4] save with 4000px height\n[5] save with 5000px height\n\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n---\nCreated with p5.js\n\n---\nThis is my first project on FX(hash) and I would like to express my special thanks to Janaina Selva, Dmarchi, Gyo and Morbeck for their support and for following the step-by-step development of this work, always contributing with a critical eye and great suggestions. I also thank the help from the FX(hash) community on Discord.\n\n---\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2023\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada",
