            "description": "*WTBS.TXT* is the first collaboration between Thomas Noya and the Waiting To Be Signed podcast crew. Using the first year of episodes as training data, Thomas trained a GPT-2 model to generate text strings from seed words, phrases, or at random; over 3000 strings were curated from the model over several months. The strings are then randomly selected from the curated set and displayed in various fonts and patterns, evoking a retro-PC style inspired by 90s net.art.\n\nAn advantage of using so little data to train a model (yes, a year of content is nothing in AI terms) is that it allows the model to run wild and create funny and fantastical diversions. We used an AI service to transcribe the episodes, which introduced many spelling variations around fx(hash)-specific terms and artist names. All of this adds up to something that we are collectively excited to share with you.\n\nFrom WTBS: A year went by fast... so fast that we fully missed doing anything to celebrate. Please think of this token as a belated celebration of the first year of Waiting To Be Signed. This project could not be possible without the hours of content we produce each week. If you have enjoyed the show, we hope you will enjoy this as well. Please collect to support the continued creation of WTBS. Collect because you are a fan (of Thomas, us or both).

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Inspired by Wiederrecht’s mastery of line and Vittoria’s notable palette, this 1/1/250 series captures the present moment. It serves as a reminder that we are more similar than we are different, leveraging homogeneous shapes to create distinctive compositions.\n\nVittoria’s poem for the collection:\n\n“In Due Time”\nWe will all become\nParticles dancing\nAcross the skyline.\n\nThe artwork listed is indeed authentic, created by, and copyright to artists Melissa Wiederrecht and Amber Vittoria; the purchase of this NFT is a purchase of the asset, not of the copyright.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTo save a high-resolution image for printing, click “open” under the image on the page for your token, and then hit:\n\nDigits “1” through “9” to get an image that is 1000 through 9000px tall.

Is midnight.. the echo of silence and my faded memories in the empty room, make my loneliness my only company.\n\n\"Loneliness\" is my first figurative (non abstract) generative artwork. It incorporates a custom (advanced) 3D modeler and renderer - shader made 100% with code in p5js (not an easy task and believe I ended up with a unique approach)\n\nHere you may see a video from the process behind this collection \nhttps://twitter.com/Uniray_net/status/1642534620439748608  \n\nCONTROLS\n\nKEYS:\n\n- Spacebar: Switch final shading\n- F: Toggle Faces - geometry triangles (on/off)\n- 1-2: Set resolution from 1x to 2x of the current dimension (possibly slower performance in higher values)\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait (default) with aspect ratio 0.85\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ when switching orientations\n\nMOUSE:\n\n- Click: Toggle Faces (on/off) (Like the F key)\n\n----\nMade with p5js and custom shaders\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\nWant to know more ? please read the \"SHORT BIO\" section here in \"Emotions\" collection: https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/22243\n\n© Apr. 2023  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

            "description": "Orbit of Influence is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, ZeroSpace NYC, 2023 and is a unique generative program created using processing's p5js and SVG. Developed from scratch, it employs a system of rule-based environments that have been a source of satisfaction for me since 1995.\n\nThe program generates three invisible planets, each at a different scale - small, medium, and large. Fifty objects then randomly select a planet, a speed to orbit around it, and one of three brush sizes - small, medium, or large. These objects move around their respective planets, painting color and texture across the planetary orbit in three-dimensional space.\n\nTo reveal the blueprint of the system, press the \"s\" key on your keyboard. The hidden algorithm that governs the brushes' movement is then displayed, revealing a mesmerizing display of synchronized choreography as the brushes interconnect with each other.\n\nPress the following keys to interact :\n\n- '1': swap the background color to \"ocean\"\n- '2': swap the background color to \"mist\"\n- '3': swap the background color to \"lilac\"\n- '4': swap the background color to \"amethyst\"\n- '5': swap the background color to \"crimson\"\n- '6': swap the background color to \"emerald\"\n\n- 'l': toggle animation loop on/off\n- 's': system reveal, show the blueprint of the algorithm\n\nJoshua Davis / PrayStation 'Orbit of Influence' / (2023) real-time generative program, 1240 x 1653 px, Date Minted: April 2023\n\nTwitter: @joshuadavis\nInstagram: @praystation\nWebsite: https://joshuadavis.com\n\nBio :\n\nSince 1995, Joshua Davis is an artist, technologist, author and designer in algorithmic image making & animation. Using programming, he writes his own code to produce interactions with users and to generate visual compositions according to rule-based, randomized processes.\n\nJoshua has exhibited his works and/or lectured at the Ars Electronica (Austria), Centre Georges Pompidou (France), Contemporary Arts Center (Cincinnati), J. Paul Getty Museum (Los Angeles),  the Tate Modern (London), the Design Museum (London), the Institute of Contemporary Arts (London), PS.1 MoMA (New York), the Whitney (New York), the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum (New York), the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (Spain), among others.\n\nSince 2000, Joshua has lectured globally about his work, inspirations and motivations at museums, galleries, institutions, art festivals, etc., and has spoken at the TED (2005) and 99U (2013) conferences about his career in algorithmic image making and open source.",

            "description": "A generative set of imaginary landscapes.\n\nTerrains continues a study of topographic media translations that began with Plastic Landscapes (2016) and our Field Guide to Martian Landscapes (2017). While the Field Guide focused on analyzing topographies of another planet, interpreted through telescopic imaging and software translation, this project focuses on the procedural generation of nonexistent landscapes. These landscapes are generated through a complex manipulation of perlin noise, a recurring algorithm used in videogames, film VFX, and generative art since the 1980s that resembles natural geological formations. By no means new, this tradition is part of a lineage of digital visualization projects focused on reproducing nature through algorithmic means. Our algorithm generates sequential bands of noise mapped on an X-Y plane, rendered in an oblique architectural projection, a techniques that comes from technical drawing conventions. This perspective produces a layering effect that flattens the terrain in an architectural way. Neither realistic nor completely abstract, the system plays with projection, entropy, and constraints to produce a collection of imaginary terrains sited on the Tezos blockchain.\n\nWe must also credit all who have explored this field of work: Ken Perlin, James M. Bardeen, Stephen Schmitt, Paul Bourke, Joseph Claghorn, Amit Patel, Inigo Quilez, Matt DesLauriers, and many many more...\n\nPress \"s\" to download PNG.\nPress \"r\" to redraw and shift stripes.\n\nBuilt with p5.js\nBy office ca\n2023",

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "*WTBS.TXT* is the first collaboration between Thomas Noya and the Waiting To Be Signed podcast crew. Using the first year of episodes as training data, Thomas trained a GPT-2 model to generate text strings from seed words, phrases, or at random; over 3000 strings were curated from the model over several months. The strings are then randomly selected from the curated set and displayed in various fonts and patterns, evoking a retro-PC style inspired by 90s net.art.\n\nAn advantage of using so little data to train a model (yes, a year of content is nothing in AI terms) is that it allows the model to run wild and create funny and fantastical diversions. We used an AI service to transcribe the episodes, which introduced many spelling variations around fx(hash)-specific terms and artist names. All of this adds up to something that we are collectively excited to share with you.\n\nFrom WTBS: A year went by fast... so fast that we fully missed doing anything to celebrate. Please think of this token as a belated celebration of the first year of Waiting To Be Signed. This project could not be possible without the hours of content we produce each week. If you have enjoyed the show, we hope you will enjoy this as well. Please collect to support the continued creation of WTBS. Collect because you are a fan (of Thomas, us or both). Collect because it is a really cool project. Huge thanks to Thomas for volunteering his time to work with us on this, and thank you to everyone who listened and supported us as we move into our second year of the show.\n\n\nControls:\n[s] save as PNG\n\n\nWTBS ⫸ GPT-2 ⫸ p5.js ⫸ Blockchain\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2023 Thomas Noya and Waiting to be Signed\n\n◉_◉",

            "description": "*WTBS.TXT* is the first collaboration between Thomas Noya and the Waiting To Be Signed podcast crew. Using the first year of episodes as training data, Thomas trained a GPT-2 model to generate text strings from seed words, phrases, or at random; over 3000 strings were curated from the model over several months. The strings are then randomly selected from the curated set and displayed in various fonts and patterns, evoking a retro-PC style inspired by 90s net.art.\n\nAn advantage of using so little data to train a model (yes, a year of content is nothing in AI terms) is that it allows the model to run wild and create funny and fantastical diversions. We used an AI service to transcribe the episodes, which introduced many spelling variations around fx(hash)-specific terms and artist names. All of this adds up to something that we are collectively excited to share with you.\n\nFrom WTBS: A year went by fast... so fast that we fully missed doing anything to celebrate. Please think of this token as a belated celebration of the first year of Waiting To Be Signed. This project could not be possible without the hours of content we produce each week. If you have enjoyed the show, we hope you will enjoy this as well. Please collect to support the continued creation of WTBS. Collect because you are a fan (of Thomas, us or both). Collect because it is a really cool project. Huge thanks to Thomas for volunteering his time to work with us on this, and thank you to everyone who listened and supported us as we move into our second year of the show.\n\n\nControls:\n[s] save as PNG\n\n\nWTBS ⫸ GPT-2 ⫸ p5.js ⫸ Blockchain\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2023 Thomas Noya and Waiting to be Signed\n\n◉_◉",
