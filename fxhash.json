            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1.

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

            "description": "Inspired by the 1984 Commodore 64 video game, Deus Ex Machina, which follows the story of a defect formed in a machine that grows and evolves until its eventual death.\n\nWe are all machines produced by other machines through a unique system of algorithms, all with the potential to go rogue and mutate into something more organic. The conclusion must be that we each have the power to alter our own existence, just as the defect was able to in Deus Ex Machina.\n\nThink of how many people you’ve seen in your life who were born with talents never used because they didn’t know how, or didn't know that they even existed. It’s not that they didn’t have the capacity; it’s just that their abilities were not the ones chosen by the system.\n\nIn this way, we are all machines programmed by a series of algorithms to suit the needs of the construct, keeping us stuck in our box. We have the ability to evolve into something more, but the only way to do this is by taking that first perilous step, risking all to explore beyond its walls.\n\n\n---------------------\n\n\nGenerative artwork by Sykcolo / @sykcoloart\n\nRoyalties: 15% - split:\n50% to the original minter\n50% to artist (me)\n\nPress '2' to '4' to generate increasingly higher resolutions of the artwork\n(will take a while to load, but works)\n\nPress 's' to save a png\n\nDetails:\n\n230 hand-picked colour pallets\n4 Entity Types\n4 Entity Moods\n4 Evolution States\n3 Types of Defect\n2 Bugs\n\nLicense: MIT",

Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

To reset to all colors, press 'v'.\n\nYou can save a PNG file using 's', a JPG using 'd', a PNG with twice your window height using 'f', and a print size image using 'g'.\n\nThis work explores composition based on generative double grid system, where rotations, displacements and noisy lines intertwine to form a playful loom.\n\nCreated with p5.js rendering in WEBGL.",

            "description": "A response to being buffeted by forces outside of our control. Platonics sought to find order, control and solace in the Platonic solids. Instead it found beauty and intrigue in the emergent chaos that can arise from even the simplest systems.\n\nIts building blocks are the five Platonic solids. Forms which have fascinated humanity for thousands of years. Their title comes from the philosophy of Plato, who equated each of the solids with a classical element.\n\nPlatonics arranges these forms in a series of geometric layouts, with varying density and randomness. At one extreme we see tidy radial circles consisting of a single solid. At the other, packed pentagons consisting of jumbled solids give rise to Escher-esque compositions which hold near infinite variety, variety enhanced by a range of pens and colours that draw and fill those solids.\n\nThis relationship between order and disorder is at the heart of Platonics. The collection seeks to show how they are not so far removed from one another – and how we might embrace them both. It also aims to give collectors a behind the scenes look at how generative compositions can be constructed.\n\nThe geometric proof that there are only five convex regular polyhedra (the Platonic solids) states that at each vertex of the solid the angles between adjacent sides must be less than 360 degrees. This amount less than 360 degrees is known as the defect angle.\n\nIt is from this geometric proof that the collection size and pricing for Platonics is derived. There will be 360 Platonics sold via a Dutch auction priced according to the defect angles of the five Platonic solids: 180 > 120 > 90 > 60 > 36.\n\nhttps://www.phaust.art/platonics\n\n----------\n\nCompetition: Submit your favourite previews via Twitter to win a free mint and print.\n\nPrints: Free gallery-grade, signed A3 prints for the first 18 mints.\n\nLive: Press ‘S’ to save in hi-res or append '&size=#' to the URL for custom height.\n\nInfo: Original artwork by Phaust.

            "description": "\"Rangxel\" is part of the live outdoor art installation - 'Computational Convergence' at India Art Fair, held from 9-12 February 2023 in New Delhi. \n\nRangxel is an interpretation of traditional Rangoli formations as tesseracts, combined to form monolithic structures. \n\nRangoli is a traditional artform that originated in India and is typically created during rituals and festivals like Diwali. It involves drawing intricate designs, typically on the floor, using materials such as colored powders, flowers, and grains. \n\nRangoli is meant to bring prosperity and happiness to a home and can range from simple geometric patterns to more complex depictions of nature.\n\nThe Rangxel tesseracts are created through rule-based instructions, following traditional Rangoli formation principles like symmetry, repeating patterns, and themes, resulting in interconnected, multi-dimensional forms of fragments.\n\nThese monolithic structures also reflect natural 3D grids found in nature such as crystals and honeycombs,presenting a deconstructed, pixelated matrix of our universe. \n\nUltimately, the reality we live in is an abstraction of the algorithm narrated by the creator.\n\n#StayPixelated\n\nControls (){\nDouble click Once to Enable Rotate around Tesseract;\nDouble click Twice to Disable  Rotate;\nDouble click Thrice to Go back original Composition;\nRotate , Zoom , Pan with Touch/Mouse;\n}\n",
