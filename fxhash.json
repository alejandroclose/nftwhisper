            "description": "SCHNEEWALD is the second release in a row of about 12 tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years.\n\nThis project explores an approach to trees with snow using a recursive algorithm and includes Three traits: a density layer for the amount of trees and another layer for the amount snow and a third for how strong the branches bend.\n\nRendering progress indicated on the top left border\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png\n\nArtist notes:\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nI experienced it in all sorts of seasonal change, packed with snow is definitely among the most amazing! \n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: https://e-art.co/project/schneewald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright Â© 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND",

            "description": "Mecha-Bamboo is the second installment in the Mecha series, where I attempt to blend mechanical elements with nature.\n\nThe main building blocks used in this piece are metal pipes, nuts and bolts forming bamboo stems and mending plates extending outwards with sharp metal scraps at their ends resembling branches and leaves. \n\nThere are 4 main arrangement variations \n\t- Two abstract variations with the metal bamboos growing out of the sides and border (20% chance each)\n\t- Two landscape arrangements, one on flat planes and the other on floating platforms.  (30% chance each)\n\nThe dominant stroke and fill colors are chosen at random from the RGB color space and are only recomputed if certain contrast criteria aren't fulfilled. \nIn combination with one of 10 hand-selected color palettes used for accents, this allows a great variation of different possible color schemes.\n\nThe structure and appearance of the bamboo, its stems and leaves are controlled by over 50 parameters that are chosen at random, giving each iteration a unique style.\n\n\n\nKeys: \nS - Save PNG image\nV - Open SVG Export menu\nSpace - Pause\n\nPlotting:\nYou can export a plottable SVG of each iteration by opening the export menu. I plot these on A3 with a 0.1mm fineliner. But depending on the density of the iteration other choices might be better suited. \n\n\nThe image is generated entirely in Javascript and the postprocessing is done with a custom shader. If there is no webgl support, the image will render without any postprocessing. You can force this by appending the URL parameter \"?noWebgl=1\".\n\nLibraries used:\nThree.js & EffectComposer\nJavascript-Voronoi by gorhill\nperlin.js by  Joseph Gentle\ndat.gui",

Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "Mecha-Bamboo is the second installment in the Mecha series, where I attempt to blend mechanical elements with nature.\n\nThe main building blocks used in this piece are metal pipes, nuts and bolts forming bamboo stems and mending plates extending outwards with sharp metal scraps at their ends resembling branches and leaves. \n\nThere are 4 main arrangement variations \n\t- Two abstract variations with the metal bamboos growing out of the sides and border (20% chance each)\n\t- Two landscape arrangements, one on flat planes and the other on floating platforms.  (30% chance each)\n\nThe dominant stroke and fill colors are chosen at random from the RGB color space and are only recomputed if certain contrast criteria aren't fulfilled. \nIn combination with one of 10 hand-selected color palettes used for accents, this allows a great variation of different possible color schemes.\n\nThe structure and appearance of the bamboo, its stems and leaves are controlled by over 50 parameters that are chosen at random, giving each iteration a unique style.\n\n\n\nKeys: \nS - Save PNG image\nV - Open SVG Export menu\nSpace - Pause\n\nPlotting:\nYou can export a plottable SVG of each iteration by opening the export menu. I plot these on A3 with a 0.1mm fineliner. But depending on the density of the iteration other choices might be better suited. \n\n\nThe image is generated entirely in Javascript and the postprocessing is done with a custom shader. If there is no webgl support, the image will render without any postprocessing. You can force this by appending the URL parameter \"?noWebgl=1\".\n\nLibraries used:\nThree.js & EffectComposer\nJavascript-Voronoi by gorhill\nperlin.js by  Joseph Gentle\ndat.gui",

            "description": "Mecha-Bamboo is the second installment in the Mecha series, where I attempt to blend mechanical elements with nature.\n\nThe main building blocks used in this piece are metal pipes, nuts and bolts forming bamboo stems and mending plates extending outwards with sharp metal scraps at their ends resembling branches and leaves. \n\nThere are 4 main arrangement variations \n\t- Two abstract variations with the metal bamboos growing out of the sides and border (20% chance each)\n\t- Two landscape arrangements, one on flat planes and the other on floating platforms.  (30% chance each)\n\nThe dominant stroke and fill colors are chosen at random from the RGB color space and are only recomputed if certain contrast criteria aren't fulfilled. \nIn combination with one of 10 hand-selected color palettes used for accents, this allows a great variation of different possible color schemes.\n\nThe structure and appearance of the bamboo, its stems and leaves are controlled by over 50 parameters that are chosen at random, giving each iteration a unique style.\n\n\n\nKeys: \nS - Save PNG image\nV - Open SVG Export menu\nSpace - Pause\n\nPlotting:\nYou can export a plottable SVG of each iteration by opening the export menu. I plot these on A3 with a 0.1mm fineliner. But depending on the density of the iteration other choices might be better suited. \n\n\nThe image is generated entirely in Javascript and the postprocessing is done with a custom shader. If there is no webgl support, the image will render without any postprocessing. You can force this by appending the URL parameter \"?noWebgl=1\".\n\nLibraries used:\nThree.js & EffectComposer\nJavascript-Voronoi by gorhill\nperlin.js by  Joseph Gentle\ndat.gui",

            "description": "'Sabler : Serengeti' is a special edition reissue of the original Sabler generator in a vibrant 'Serengeti' palette which was omitted from the original collection. \n\nTowards the end of the production of the original Sabler collection, the creative decision was made to reduce the number of palettes from the thirteen that had been created to a smaller number, in order to improve the cohesiveness of the collection overall. While 'Serengeti' remained one of the stronger palettes, it was ultimately excluded in favour of the 'Annaliese' palette, in homage to an Anni Albers tapestry that originally inspired the 'Sabler' collection. \n\nHere, the 'Serengeti' palette is provided as a companion piece to the original Sabler collection to give collectors the opportunity to pair their output with their existing collection if they choose.\n\nBelow follows an edited description for the original 'Sabler' collection:\n\n'Sabler', an anagram of 'Albers', is a generative homage to the work of the Bauhaus textile artist Anni Albers.\n\nThe aesthetic of this piece and its proportions are guided by the Golden Ratio (1.618 : 1) and as such, each part of the composition relates in some way to its larger self.\n\nAs lines playfully extend and overlap one another from various grid segments, patterns appear, 'ghost' shadings emerge and complexity is implied even with the use of very simple elements.\n\nThere are no rarities or special features, other than for you to enjoy the unique qualities of your piece!\n\nYou can save a high resolution 3000px x 3000px PNG of your edition by pressing the 'S' key.",
