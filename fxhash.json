It represents the generative processes driving fxhash tokens. Generative Tokens are fed with a unique hash to produce unique outputs based on the hash — they are functions with a hash as single input.\n\nThe growth that comes out of the text is driven by a \"Dividing-Aggregating Walkers\" (DAW) algorithm. The hash drives all the DAW settings, as well as a mutation factor which is responsible for changes in each Walker parameters as they divide.\n\nSome iterations will produce very simple outputs whereas others might be more chaotic.\n\nPiece by @ciphrd for fxhash",

            "description": "Initial conditions are stated, and then the particles set in motion - the root of generative art. My goal with this piece was to create an illustration that seemed to be from an earlier (or perhaps later?) time; not, at any rate, our current moment. The background is a very subtle gradient; then it is heavily stippled, and followed with a particle system to create more subtle texture. (Look for the very small \"hairs\" in the background; they are more obvious on the dark ones. They are a subset of the main particle system.) \n\nFollowing that, the main particle system is run in real time; I like to \"show my work\" for generative pieces, as any collector of my previous mints knows, and this is no exception. \"Run\" your mint for an animated drawing experience. Note that fxpreview() hits a few frames before the end of the full run. I did it this way to ensure a consistent preview. As a result, the preview and the final image will be slightly different, only because the final image has a slightly longer lifespan. \n\nThere are multiple \"special\" modes, each with a 10% likelihood: \n\n\"spiral\" will rotate the canvas as the particle system is running.\n\"chaos\" uses random X/Y vectors during the acceleration phase, rather than X or Y.\n\"occasionals\" adds random large particles in an opposing color.\n\nIn addition, there are three possible shapes:\n\n\"circle\" draws circles for the particles.\n\"square\" draws squares for the particles.\n\"jagged\" draws mostly circles, with a 0.01% chance of a square at a 45 degree angle. \n\nFinally, there is a non-attribute feature, where the entire piece is drawn at a 45 degree angle. This has a 20% likelihood, but is only apparent on pieces that have no special, or the \"occasional\" special. Working the math out, you have a 16% likelihood for getting a piece at a noticeable 45 degree angle. \n\nAll main colors have an equal likelihood, but the light background is only 20%. ",

Because of that, the rendering process can be really slow on low-end machines. Note that it might not work on some older computers or mobiles because of that. Note also that the previews generated are using low quality settings to help fxhash servers generating them.\n\nTHE OUTPUT CAN TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES TO BE FULLY RENDERED - So take a seat, have a break, relax and enjoy a nice cup of coffee…\n\nControls\n// D - Display the info (samples, quality settings…)\n// S - Save as png\n// Q - Toggle between high/low quality\n// C - Unlock camera (use your mouse, rotate/zoom to find new views!)\n\nExternal settings - useful for high-res renders\n// You can tweak the render settings by adding some parameters to the url (click on “open” and add the parameters at the end of the url.\n// exemple: /?samples=3000&width=1920&height=1080\n// recommended ratio between 1:1 and 16:9\n// samples: between 10 and 5000\n// width: between 100 and 4000\n// height: between 100 and 4000\n\nMade with : ThreeJS + Three-gpu-pathtracer\n2022 - Parse/Error",

            "description": "This is an album of cities too ideal to ever materialise.\n\nIt consists of 256 algorithmically generated plans that resemble drawings of Vincenzo Scamozzi, Pietro Cataneo, Filarete and other theorists of the Italian Renaissance. The cities differ in size, the grid of the streets, the landscape around them and the people that inhabit their utopian walls. They carry names that are Italian exonyms of real European cities, drawing a vision of a different world that enacts a mixture of military perfection with social superiority. Flawless, harmonious, unconquerable and utterly impossible.\n\nHistory brought us many theories about ideal cities, but very few examples exist today. Italian Palmanova or Polish Zamość are the few to remind us how hard it is to shape reality according to ideals. When confronted with the material world, its idealism becomes the city's grates foe.\n\nTo zoom, press a mouse button over the image or touch the screen.
