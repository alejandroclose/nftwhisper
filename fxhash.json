            "description": "“Allan McCollum’s Plaster Surrogates was a thought-provoking series of sculptures that examines the role of art in contemporary society. The sculptures are cast from plaster and painted to resemble frames, mats, and black rectangles, creating a visual illusion of empty picture frames. McCollum's intention with the surrogates was to comment on the mass production and consumption of art objects, as well as the way in which art is often valued for its social function rather than its inherent aesthetic qualities.”\n\nContinuing the integration of generative art and conceptual art, this work is a digital reproduction and inspiration of Plaster Surrogates - 1982 by noted conceptual artist, Allan McCollum.\n\nEven though the original work had completely black rectangles, in this work, contrasting colors are used in some variations to increase the beauty. The dimensions and colors of the frames are calculated according to McCollum's original work. Various color palettes and canvas sizes have been used.\n\n-----------\n\nNo images are used, created entirely by coding. Textures such as wood, canvas, and oil paint have been created to create a realistic look. Preview optimized for fxhash capturing system and full rendering can take up to several minutes, so I highly recommend checking out this artwork in high quality.\n\n\nTo save the artwork in high resolution, Open it in the live mode, it will be saved automatically after completion.\n\nMade with p5js.",

            "description": "NEBELWALD is the first series of about 10 different tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years. \n\nThis project explores a minimalist approach to tree naturalism using a recursive algorithm and includes three traits: a density layer of fog, a measure of tree growth, and the softness of snowfall.\n\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png.\n\nArtist notes:\n\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nOnce I experienced it in a dense fog, which was amazing! beautiful and mysterious at the same time. This has definitely inspired the NEBELWALD work series.\n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: http://lumicon.de/e-art/project/nebelwald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND\n",

            "description": "“Allan McCollum’s Plaster Surrogates was a thought-provoking series of sculptures that examines the role of art in contemporary society. The sculptures are cast from plaster and painted to resemble frames, mats, and black rectangles, creating a visual illusion of empty picture frames. McCollum's intention with the surrogates was to comment on the mass production and consumption of art objects, as well as the way in which art is often valued for its social function rather than its inherent aesthetic qualities.”\n\nContinuing the integration of generative art and conceptual art, this work is a digital reproduction and inspiration of Plaster Surrogates - 1982 by noted conceptual artist, Allan McCollum.\n\nEven though the original work had completely black rectangles, in this work, contrasting colors are used in some variations to increase the beauty. The dimensions and colors of the frames are calculated according to McCollum's original work. Various color palettes and canvas sizes have been used.\n\n-----------\n\nNo images are used, created entirely by coding. Textures such as wood, canvas, and oil paint have been created to create a realistic look. Preview optimized for fxhash capturing system and full rendering can take up to several minutes, so I highly recommend checking out this artwork in high quality.\n\n\nTo save the artwork in high resolution, Open it in the live mode, it will be saved automatically after completion.\n\nMade with p5js.",

After the roses are fully formed, a random mask of heavy ink is algorithmically screened over the flowers in a pattern of horizontal or vertical lines, occasionally fully flooding the painting. The accumulation of choices evokes graffiti or printmaking. The sequence of choices are interpreted by the computer according to the algorithm. The beauty of these choices are determined by the viewer.\n\nEach piece takes roughly 10 seconds to generate.\n\nArtist: @sarah_ridgley\nPress [s] to save the image\nJavaScript / p5js | script size: 11kb\n\n",

            "description": "Asterium is a token that will grow with you, for an entire year. Changing and morphing over time to eventually reach its equilibrium.\n\nIt is a token where I try to symbolize the journey of life.\nWhere looking back is the best way to look forward.\nWhere looking into the future is not a possibility.\nWhere each day is as uncertain as the next.\n\nA token that will surprise you and have its ups and downs as it grows over time.\n\n\n\nPricing:\nDutch auction 64-16-8, where anybody that picks one up at 64 tez gets a print of how their galaxy looks on any day from the present to day 0. Meaning you can claim the print at any point in the future.\n\nThe print will be printed on high quality hahnemühle torchon paper at 30x40 cm (11.81 x 15.75 in). Printed at a local print shop here in Utrecht. This paper has a rough texture to it that matches the textures of space perfectly.\n\n\n\nUsage:\n- Hover over your Asterium to view the name, date, days passed, status and render stats.\n- Double press to export the current frame as a .png image.\n- Use the slider at the bottom to scroll back in time to the days before today, you can go as far back as day 0 and as far forwards as today.\n- The token refreshes every hour, so framing it in a digital picture frame is totally possible!\n\n",

            "description": "Asterium is a token that will grow with you, for an entire year. Changing and morphing over time to eventually reach its equilibrium.\n\nIt is a token where I try to symbolize the journey of life.\nWhere looking back is the best way to look forward.\nWhere looking into the future is not a possibility.\nWhere each day is as uncertain as the next.\n\nA token that will surprise you and have its ups and downs as it grows over time.\n\n\n\nPricing:\nDutch auction 64-16-8, where anybody that picks one up at 64 tez gets a print of how their galaxy looks on any day from the present to day 0. Meaning you can claim the print at any point in the future.\n\nThe print will be printed on high quality hahnemühle torchon paper at 30x40 cm (11.81 x 15.75 in). Printed at a local print shop here in Utrecht. This paper has a rough texture to it that matches the textures of space perfectly.\n\n\n\nUsage:\n- Hover over your Asterium to view the name, date, days passed, status and render stats.\n- Double press to export the current frame as a .png image.\n- Use the slider at the bottom to scroll back in time to the days before today, you can go as far back as day 0 and as far forwards as today.\n- The token refreshes every hour, so framing it in a digital picture frame is totally possible!\n\n",

            "description": "In march of this year, I started working on a new series involving multi-layering, and overriding shapes. Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",
