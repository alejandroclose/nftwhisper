            "description": "Mudaashiku (「無駄足区」- “Fool’s Errand District”) invokes the place where you first really experienced what it means to be a person in a city. Were you awestruck? Did you feel lost or disoriented by a realization of the size of the spaces around you? Perhaps you sought some detail, some small thing to focus on to reorient yourself and feel like a person again in the face of such immensity and confusion.\n\nThis work is inspired by an attempt to capture some of the feeling I had when I first moved to Tokyo and was utterly overwhelmed. It was both exciting and frightening to suddenly be lost in a place so immense and unfamiliar. If Stendhal Syndrome refers to the fearful ecstasy of experiencing the beauties of Florence, then there must be something similar for the first experience of a great city. This work attempts only to point in the direction of such a feeling.\n\nTake a moment to experience the district as a whole, but then, with a change of perception, your focus may shift to the individual building or group of buildings. And then, back again. This duality of scales has been integral to the development of the work.\n\nThe work expresses eight features:\nAspect ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.41, 1.41:1, 1.2:1\nEnvironment: Central (most common), north river, east river, south causeway, west causeway (most rare).\nPalette: Thirty seven selected palettes. Chosen either for their aesthetic qualities, or as an attempted expression of some element of urban life.\nDivisions: 15, 18, or 21.\nColor variance: 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36, 0.54.\nSun direction: East or west.\nLocale: Either central or commuter town. Determines the height profile of the district.\nRoads: Represented, or not.\n\nThe work begins by gradually revealing the layout of the district. This process can take from about 6 seconds to as much as 2 minutes, but 50 to 60 seconds is typical. When this process is complete, the colors and facades will be added and the work revealed.\n\nOnce the work is complete, it can be adjusted using the following controls:\n\n[0] Fit size to window (default)\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels\n[4] Set shortest edge to 8000 pixels (please be patient!)\n\nAfter changing the dimensions, the work may appear the same size in your browser. The new dimensions will be apparent when you save an image.\n\n[s] Save work at current dimensions\n[b] Add or remove border\n[g] Add or remove background grain\n\nMade in 100% vanilla javascript.\nOpenSimplexNoise.js used for noise.\n",

It explores the tension between hard and soft forms and parallel projection, where the illusion of perspective is flattened into a highly geometric composition. These geometries feature a flowing texture that runs infinitely, reflecting on the endless nature of virtual space. The project blends together imagery from early computer terminals, video games, and ascii art to produce a dynamic, intricate, visual experience.\n\nWRAPPERS is very GPU intensive. For a smoother experience, you can change the scale by adding the parameter \"?scale=2\" to the URL.\n\nPress 'i' to invert the colors.\nPress '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6' to scale the bitmap glyphs.\nPress 'g' to download a looping animated GIF (150 frames). Please make sure to let the animation run for at least 30 seconds first.\nPress 's' to capture a single frame.\nPress 'f' (or double tap in mobile) to stretch to full screen.\nMade with vanilla javascript and GLSL.

            "description": "Mudaashiku (「無駄足区」- “Fool’s Errand District”) invokes the place where you first really experienced what it means to be a person in a city. Were you awestruck? Did you feel lost or disoriented by a realization of the size of the spaces around you? Perhaps you sought some detail, some small thing to focus on to reorient yourself and feel like a person again in the face of such immensity and confusion.\n\nThis work is inspired by an attempt to capture some of the feeling I had when I first moved to Tokyo and was utterly overwhelmed. It was both exciting and frightening to suddenly be lost in a place so immense and unfamiliar. If Stendhal Syndrome refers to the fearful ecstasy of experiencing the beauties of Florence, then there must be something similar for the first experience of a great city. This work attempts only to point in the direction of such a feeling.\n\nTake a moment to experience the district as a whole, but then, with a change of perception, your focus may shift to the individual building or group of buildings. And then, back again. This duality of scales has been integral to the development of the work.\n\nThe work expresses eight features:\nAspect ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.41, 1.41:1, 1.2:1\nEnvironment: Central (most common), north river, east river, south causeway, west causeway (most rare).\nPalette: Thirty seven selected palettes. Chosen either for their aesthetic qualities, or as an attempted expression of some element of urban life.\nDivisions: 15, 18, or 21.\nColor variance: 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36, 0.54.\nSun direction: East or west.\nLocale: Either central or commuter town. Determines the height profile of the district.\nRoads: Represented, or not.\n\nThe work begins by gradually revealing the layout of the district. This process can take from about 6 seconds to as much as 2 minutes, but 50 to 60 seconds is typical. When this process is complete, the colors and facades will be added and the work revealed.\n\nOnce the work is complete, it can be adjusted using the following controls:\n\n[0] Fit size to window (default)\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels\n[4] Set shortest edge to 8000 pixels (please be patient!)\n\nAfter changing the dimensions, the work may appear the same size in your browser. The new dimensions will be apparent when you save an image.\n\n[s] Save work at current dimensions\n[b] Add or remove border\n[g] Add or remove background grain\n\nMade in 100% vanilla javascript.\nOpenSimplexNoise.js used for noise.\n",

Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds.

            "description": "This algorithm I've named Flow3.js is like a dance of mathematics and digital art. Imagine myself at the center of a virtual world, where the rules of art and science merge into a harmonious dance.\n\nIn the center of the stage stands the \"Cellular Automaton,\" a digital entity with a life of its own. This entity is composed of a grid of cells, each with a state, 0 or 1, like two actors taking turns on the stage. Each turn, these actors follow a pre-defined script, the \"rules,\" which change their state based on their past behavior. It's as if the stage itself is a fabric in constant transformation, woven by the very rules.\n\nBeyond the main stage, there's a secondary dance in progress. Here, \"particles\" elegantly move through a flow field. This field is generated by the art of noise, where chaos and randomness create seemingly random beauty. The particles follow the flow, dancing through invisible currents, like leaves drifting in a mountain stream.\n\nThe particles themselves are like digital brushstrokes on the virtual canvas. Each particle has a position, a velocity, and a color. When a particle passes through a certain region, the color on the canvas changes, like a work of art evolving and transforming. It's a symphony of shapes and colors, guided by mathematics and randomness.\n\nAs the show progresses, the digital world comes to life, creating a unique visual and artistic experience. It's an ever-evolving work of art, a harmony between the precision of mathematical rules and the freedom of artistic expression. As spectators of this digital performance, we can only grasp a taste of this ephemeral beauty, a fleeting moment in this ethereal dance of data and forms.\n\nI used p5.js and the algorithm I created Flow3.js (of which I report an example).\nCanvas 4000x5000 (after several tests it was considered the best for the job).\nPress P to save as png \npress J to save as jpeg\n\nKisses\nKenzo",

Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

            "description": "Mudaashiku (「無駄足区」- “Fool’s Errand District”) invokes the place where you first really experienced what it means to be a person in a city. Were you awestruck? Did you feel lost or disoriented by a realization of the size of the spaces around you? Perhaps you sought some detail, some small thing to focus on to reorient yourself and feel like a person again in the face of such immensity and confusion.\n\nThis work is inspired by an attempt to capture some of the feeling I had when I first moved to Tokyo and was utterly overwhelmed. It was both exciting and frightening to suddenly be lost in a place so immense and unfamiliar. If Stendhal Syndrome refers to the fearful ecstasy of experiencing the beauties of Florence, then there must be something similar for the first experience of a great city. This work attempts only to point in the direction of such a feeling.\n\nTake a moment to experience the district as a whole, but then, with a change of perception, your focus may shift to the individual building or group of buildings. And then, back again. This duality of scales has been integral to the development of the work.\n\nThe work expresses eight features:\nAspect ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.41, 1.41:1, 1.2:1\nEnvironment: Central (most common), north river, east river, south causeway, west causeway (most rare).\nPalette: Thirty seven selected palettes. Chosen either for their aesthetic qualities, or as an attempted expression of some element of urban life.\nDivisions: 15, 18, or 21.\nColor variance: 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36, 0.54.\nSun direction: East or west.\nLocale: Either central or commuter town. Determines the height profile of the district.\nRoads: Represented, or not.\n\nThe work begins by gradually revealing the layout of the district. This process can take from about 6 seconds to as much as 2 minutes, but 50 to 60 seconds is typical. When this process is complete, the colors and facades will be added and the work revealed.\n\nOnce the work is complete, it can be adjusted using the following controls:\n\n[0] Fit size to window (default)\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels\n[4] Set shortest edge to 8000 pixels (please be patient!)\n\nAfter changing the dimensions, the work may appear the same size in your browser. The new dimensions will be apparent when you save an image.\n\n[s] Save work at current dimensions\n[b] Add or remove border\n[g] Add or remove background grain\n\nMade in 100% vanilla javascript.\nOpenSimplexNoise.js used for noise.\n",

            "description": "Mudaashiku (「無駄足区」- “Fool’s Errand District”) invokes the place where you first really experienced what it means to be a person in a city. Were you awestruck? Did you feel lost or disoriented by a realization of the size of the spaces around you? Perhaps you sought some detail, some small thing to focus on to reorient yourself and feel like a person again in the face of such immensity and confusion.\n\nThis work is inspired by an attempt to capture some of the feeling I had when I first moved to Tokyo and was utterly overwhelmed. It was both exciting and frightening to suddenly be lost in a place so immense and unfamiliar. If Stendhal Syndrome refers to the fearful ecstasy of experiencing the beauties of Florence, then there must be something similar for the first experience of a great city. This work attempts only to point in the direction of such a feeling.\n\nTake a moment to experience the district as a whole, but then, with a change of perception, your focus may shift to the individual building or group of buildings. And then, back again. This duality of scales has been integral to the development of the work.\n\nThe work expresses eight features:\nAspect ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.41, 1.41:1, 1.2:1\nEnvironment: Central (most common), north river, east river, south causeway, west causeway (most rare).\nPalette: Thirty seven selected palettes. Chosen either for their aesthetic qualities, or as an attempted expression of some element of urban life.\nDivisions: 15, 18, or 21.\nColor variance: 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36, 0.54.\nSun direction: East or west.\nLocale: Either central or commuter town. Determines the height profile of the district.\nRoads: Represented, or not.\n\nThe work begins by gradually revealing the layout of the district. This process can take from about 6 seconds to as much as 2 minutes, but 50 to 60 seconds is typical. When this process is complete, the colors and facades will be added and the work revealed.\n\nOnce the work is complete, it can be adjusted using the following controls:\n\n[0] Fit size to window (default)\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels\n[4] Set shortest edge to 8000 pixels (please be patient!)\n\nAfter changing the dimensions, the work may appear the same size in your browser. The new dimensions will be apparent when you save an image.\n\n[s] Save work at current dimensions\n[b] Add or remove border\n[g] Add or remove background grain\n\nMade in 100% vanilla javascript.\nOpenSimplexNoise.js used for noise.\n",
