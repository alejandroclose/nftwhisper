Keep in mind that this will result in a slightly different image, but colors/shapes/general layout will remain the same. The default size is 2048x2048.\n\n@teaboswell, 2022\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt",

            "description": "Wandering Nets is a digital kinetic light sculpture by Matt Ebb.\n\nNetworks of light are created and connected via random walks in space and colour. Emergent structures are revealed by the ambient interaction, tension and collision of these networks within themselves and orbiting shadowed spherical bodies.\n\nThe piece is the result of several months of custom development in realtime volume rendering. The scene data is generated in javascript and rendered with a bespoke GLSL raytracer - no external libraries are used.\n\nThis is a graphically intensive shader. By default it will adaptively adjust sampling quality to target 30fps, though a reasonably fast GPU is recommended for best results. \n\nMouse drag: Orbit the camera in 3D to explore compositions\n[ and ] keys: Override the adaptive samples per pixel lower or higher to trade noise for framerate\n\nMarch 2022",
