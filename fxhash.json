            "description": "Cellular Automata are one of the oldest and simplest classes of generative systems. Beginning with the highly abstracted, reductionist models of artificial life research by Stanislav Ulam and John von Neumann in the 1940s, Barricelli in the early 1950s, then re-discovered, formalized, expanded and popularized by other mathematicians like Conway and Wolfram 20-30 years later, it's a long-running field of research, rich with unexpected surprises and new discoveries. C-SCAPE is (a partial) result of over 20 years of my own explorations and a celebration of these simple systems.\n\nMost of my purely generative work has been about creating and harnessing emergent complexity & nonrepetitve, ever-changing behaviors (and their interactions) borne from extremely simple systems, mechanisms, algorithms & languages: Exposing, investigating (and yes, celebrating) generativity in its raw form. By minimizing, though not entirely avoiding, additional human aesthetic decision making (here primarily in the form of curating automata rules & color themes), I'm trying to focus the observer on the raw beauty of the underlying processes and bring it to the fore. My hope is, this too will lead viewers asking themselves the deeper questions about the nature of rules, behavior, order and complexity in their own lives, esp. in the current rising polarizing political & anti-science climate. Furthermore, I'd like to provide a counter point and emphasize the unique qualities of generative art, compared to other, more figurative and abstract art approaches.\n\nC-SCAPE simulates a shared toroidal environment in which multiple cellular automata (CA) are evolving and influencing each other, forming short-lived symbioses and/or wiping each other out, only to be restored again later on. The automata are all operating on a single row of pixels at a time and therefore are only 1-dimensional. Yet, many of them also have a short term memory and can produce more complex structures/behaviors by utilizing their memory of previous cell states. Each individually minted version produces a unique system which evolves over time and never repeats.\n\nThe final selection of CA rules used in this piece is the result of many years of experimentation with 100,000s of different configurations and many (manual) review/pruning/cataloging sessions to encourage the minted editions to cover a interesting & balanced subset of the more than duodecillion (10^39) possible individual structures & textures (not including interactions and/or color variations)...\n\nViewing\n\nThe piece in best viewed in medium/high resolution landscape format. The horizontal resolution should be at the very least 800 pixels, preferably double that or higher. There's a max. pixel resolution limit of 4096 pixels in either direction, but CPU performance might suffer at these resolutions. On narrow/mobile portrait ratios the piece will be shown 90 degrees rotated and is scrolling sideways.\n\nControls\n\n- x : export current frame\n- r : randomize environment\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and thi.ng",

            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "Timeless... a word that makes time indescribable. I want to talk about that point in space and time that seems endless, where past, present, and future are intertwined. In a space where endless time and rivers flow, without beginning and without end, always flowing and at the same moment, not recorded and not forgotten. In the period when the earth speaks of itself with a call of love and passion in every moment of life. When the heart sinks into the past, each emotion has its people. Here, feelings, thoughts, and ideas shine in an endless beam of time, each drop of which has a deep immersion in the vast sea of the past and experiences. A place where borders are erased and people connect with the earth. That bright spot in time and place reminds us that we are all part of a bigger story. Events that are connected from beginning to end are always ongoing and have eternity and beauty. From thousands of years ago until today, nature has shown endless displays of its special beauty. I want to talk about its sedimentary textures and its various colors, signs of an infinite path of time, and natural changes that have affected it, and each piece of it tells a mysterious story of its journey through time; From its formation in the depths of the seas and rivers to the emergence on the surface of the earth. A natural miracle, which, with its beauty, draws us to a world of greatness and wonder. Grooves that scream from the depths of time remind us that everything in this world is an infinite and beautiful journey, and we are part of this great world.\nPerhaps it is a symbol of beauty and stability in the stone world. Wonders that tell us about the distant past. It begins when the universe began to form and continues to this day. This geological formation, which was formed millions of years ago, is a masterpiece of earth maps that takes us to distant, complicated, and adventurous times. Textures of sedimentary rocks that preserve their beauty and special patterns tell a story of the journey of nature's superpower. Thin layers of blue, green, and red stones, make a valuable past for us; From water currents, solar eclipses, and deep underground fun.\nAnd finally, I conclude that the earth is an infinite museum of beauty and history. Each layer of this formation tells us a new chapter of the greatness of the world. A story that continues to this day and always fascinates us by watching his works.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "Title: \"Punctuated Equilibrium\"\n\nBespoke artwork that also acts as a token for a yearly subscription to The Tickle - 12 monthly issues of the pre-eminent magazine for contemporary digital art and creative writing (@inwarhol@twitter.com). This special artwork for the February issue is created by Andrew Brereton (@aebrer@genart.social), entitled \"Punctuated Equilibrium\". Each monthly issue is airdropped on the first Friday of each month to holders of the token. Primary collection activates the subscription - secondary collectors simply adopt the existing subscription, receiving all remaining issues. \n\nHolders also become members of The Tickle Subscribers Club, gaining access to exclusive airdrops of free art from our featured artists!\n\n-- \n\nPunctuated Equilibrium is a piece about Entropy Locking and searching infinite spaces. Roughly every 10 seconds, the current equilibrium is checked, and if it doesn't meet the right conditions, the random seed is incremented. Each search leaves its own trace behind, getting sucked into the final equilibrium which is reached (if a valid solution is discovered). This can happen right away, or it can take infinite time.\n\nThe seed is akin to the \"conditions\" of the world these pixels live in (due to the restrictions imposed by the entropy locking). Just like if our universe had different conditions, different life may have arisen; in this piece each seed provides unique conditions for the (brutally simple) automata rules that push the pixels around. This seed is what is changed when a solution fails.\n\nLike I have done previously in \"RGB Summoning Cycles\", I am using a buffer to inspect the progress of the piece for a given seed. Unlike in RGB Summoning Cycles, this search is strictly destined to succeed: it will always find an equilibrium which modifies all of the displayed pixels in a consistent pattern. However, over time the consequences of the failed searches leave their trace, resulting in the full complexity of the final piece, which is designed to cycle and iterate infinitely within the stable equilibrium it eventually discovers.\n\nIn nature, solutions are not pre-computed: they are evolved out of an insanely complex mess. Often, this plays out via a phenomenon known as \"Punctuated Equilibrium\", or \"Punctuated Evolution\". Long periods of stability cycle regularly with brief periods of massive change. I think we see this pattern simply because it's a reliable way to shake up entrenched, complex, and random systems; after all, we only see the things that succeeded and the equilibria that survived to the present day. Everything else merely remains as traces buried in the noise.\n",

            "description": "Timeless... a word that makes time indescribable. I want to talk about that point in space and time that seems endless, where past, present, and future are intertwined. In a space where endless time and rivers flow, without beginning and without end, always flowing and at the same moment, not recorded and not forgotten. In the period when the earth speaks of itself with a call of love and passion in every moment of life. When the heart sinks into the past, each emotion has its people. Here, feelings, thoughts, and ideas shine in an endless beam of time, each drop of which has a deep immersion in the vast sea of the past and experiences. A place where borders are erased and people connect with the earth. That bright spot in time and place reminds us that we are all part of a bigger story. Events that are connected from beginning to end are always ongoing and have eternity and beauty. From thousands of years ago until today, nature has shown endless displays of its special beauty. I want to talk about its sedimentary textures and its various colors, signs of an infinite path of time, and natural changes that have affected it, and each piece of it tells a mysterious story of its journey through time; From its formation in the depths of the seas and rivers to the emergence on the surface of the earth. A natural miracle, which, with its beauty, draws us to a world of greatness and wonder. Grooves that scream from the depths of time remind us that everything in this world is an infinite and beautiful journey, and we are part of this great world.\nPerhaps it is a symbol of beauty and stability in the stone world. Wonders that tell us about the distant past. It begins when the universe began to form and continues to this day. This geological formation, which was formed millions of years ago, is a masterpiece of earth maps that takes us to distant, complicated, and adventurous times. Textures of sedimentary rocks that preserve their beauty and special patterns tell a story of the journey of nature's superpower. Thin layers of blue, green, and red stones, make a valuable past for us; From water currents, solar eclipses, and deep underground fun.\nAnd finally, I conclude that the earth is an infinite museum of beauty and history. Each layer of this formation tells us a new chapter of the greatness of the world. A story that continues to this day and always fascinates us by watching his works.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "Each monogrid artwork gets initialized with a start up algorithm that builds up a set of rectangles and fills them with pixels. There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

However, what rules should a simulated environment follow when no physical constraints are inherent to the digital environment?\n\nThis project continues the exploration of shaping digital matter that I began on hicetnunc in 2021. Each token creates an image of a unique sculpture generated with a custom growth/degrowth algorithm. The image is rendered with a tailored raytracing script.\n\n---\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones for the 800x800px image.\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the resolution from preview quality to a print of approx. 30x30cm. There may be minor differences in tone or contrast for different resolutions.\n\nIn live mode:\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.\nClick STL to download the digital model to view on your computer or 3d print at home [experimental]",

Full description of the artwork+instructions here: https://www.iillucid.com/aprendizajes/\n\nThe artwork allows the user to:\n\n* Change resolution: press 'd' followed by any number from 1 to 9 to add that amount to the pixel density. If you get a black screen you have surpassed what your graphics card can handle: press d + 0 to reset the pixel density. You can fine tune pressing d followed by + or - (+/- 0.5).\n* Save image: press 's' to save the current image as png. For a higher resolution png, 1st increase the resolution using 'd' and then save the image with 's'.\n* Tune image parameters: press 'z' (brightness), 'x' (contrast), 'g' (gamma), 'b' (blur) followed by + or - to adjust. Toggle tuning with 'a'. Press 'n' then + or - to adjust amount of noise.\n* Redraw: 'r' (changes how lines are drawn)\n\nIt is recommended to read the full instructions on the article.",

The tip of the triangle is the uterus which makes the space grow.\n-- LIA DREI (Diaries, 2004)\n\nMy paintings have no past, they are empty of meaning in the present, but await the discussions of the future, as remotely as possible.\nAnd this is why they don't have their feet firmly planted in the ground, although there are invisible roots that take life from the earth, like so many blades of grass.\nWhile I work I look for the truth in what I do. The time is not yesterday because it would be false, it is not today because the emotion takes my breath away and I die every moment and am reborn after every new brushstroke.\nSoon after, time becomes old, useless, meaningless. I never know what will come out with the next brushstroke or spatula stroke.\nMy thoughts go at supersonic speed and only stop to choose another color. The one just painted is never the right one. So I live the life of the new painting with the sense of mystery that the moonless night has. (…)\n-- LIA DREI (Notes, 1962)\n\n----\n\nI never talk about myself.\n\nI'm not creative.\nI blatantly steal other people's art.\nI'm a bad coder, I copy, paste, mix ideas.\nI often ruin it, degrade it.\nBut I always make it mine what I like.\n\nI absorb.\n\n-- ALESSANDRO FIORE (fxhash, 2024)\n\n\n—————\n\nThe work is created responsive by default and it will adapt to the browser window.

Franke, a pioneer of computer art, passed away on July 16, 2022 at the age of 95. CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE is an homage to Franke’s MONDRIAN software developed for the Texas Instruments TI 99/4 home computer in 1979, and it’s a fundraiser to digitize his archive:\n\n“Our goal is to raise 20,000 Euro so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. If we raise more money, it will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.” \n\nEach frame, a single “pixel” is added to the CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE image. When the software first loads, 100,000 frames are run in the background to start things off. Keep it running for hours or days to see it transform entirely — it’s an “infinite animation.”",

The compositions can be chaotic and maybe even a little messy, but they also can be vibrant and diverse… which is really what this is trying to celebrate: diversity and expression.\n\nSimply, it’s about the emotions associated with whatever frees you.\n\nPlease see the linked fxtext article (on the main project page) for a more in-depth dissection of the concept. It’s less of a technical discussion, and more about the experience of the artist, and how it became linked with the feelings they associate with the art.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nFor higher resolutions, you can append “&density=2” to the url to double the size, “&density=3” to triple, and so on.\n(This is highly recommended.)\n\nTo adjust grain, you can append “&grain=##” to the url. 40 is the default, and 0 will remove it completely.",

            "description": "fx(mash) is my humble contribution to celebrating #fxhashturnsone\n\nThis series is based on a simple algorithm - lines of a random length are drawn on a square grid until the grid is full.\n\nI have added a variety of features based on some of my favorite fxhash projects and a few special guests.\n\nThis collection is intentionally diverse and disorderly, that's a nice way of saying I only had a short period of time following the release of Acequia. As a result, some of the outputs might be weird, messy, or even bordering on broken (if you get one of the latter please let me know and I'll reimburse you).\n\nDespite being a bit rough around the edges, I hope fx(mash) reflects some measure of my love for the fxhash community. If you're feeling kind, then perhaps it even harks back to the experimental early days :)\n\nThe last year has been an incredible journey, thank you for letting me be a part of our story so far.\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press [s] to save the current image\n- Press [g] to toggle grain\n- Press [h] for a high-res output\n\nBeta Controls (in live view, definitely not fully tested):\n\n- Press [p] to start/pause animation\n- Press [i] to slow down animation\n- Press [o] to speed up animation\n\nAll primary sales go to Savepakistan.\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nfx(mash) uses Gorilla Sun's grain implementation, a big thanks to him and meezwhite for a great article that is well worth supporting https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/all-about-that-grain\n\nThank you to the artists who created the following collections. Some were the source for palettes, others directly inspired traits, and some I thought would be fun to include as specific trait values.\n\nPalettes:\n\nArchetype / Kjetil Golid / @kgolid\nCHROMATLAS / Aleksandra Jovanić / @alexis_o_O\nContrapuntos / Marcelo Soria-Rodriguez / @msoriaro\nCuts / Todemashi / @todemashi\nEdifice / Ben Kovach / @bendotk\nEthereal Microcosm / ciphrd / @ciphrd\nFactura / Mathias Isaksen / @st4yhome_art\nFarbteiler / Erik Swahn / @erikswahn\nFidenza / Tyler Hobbs / @tylerxhobbs\nGarden Monoliths / Zancan / @zancan\ng l a s s / punevyr / @punevyr\nGRAPHEME / Sarah Ridgley / @sarah_ridgley\nLoom / Andreas Rau / @andreasrau_eu\nMemories of Qilin / Emily Xie / @emilyxxie\nMeridian / Matt DesLauriers / @mattdesl\nMillefoglie / Stefano Contiero / @stefan_contiero\nMountain View / Florian Berger / @flockaroo\nNetwork C / Casey REAS / @reas\nProxima / Jacek Markusiewicz & IsmaHelio / @jMarkusiewicz & @ismahelios\nReading a Book / Kim Asendorf / @kimasendorf\nResistance Effect / Itzel Yard / @ix_shells\nScreens / Thomas Lin Pedersen / @thomasp85\nSedimentary Dissolution / landlinesart / @landlinesart1\nSeptember / Tyler Boswell / @teaboswell\nSolace / lunarean / @lunarean\nSVRFACED / Lisa Orth / @lisaorthstudio\nTBOA / Shvembldr / @shvembldr\nTrossets / Anna Carreras / @carreras_anna\nThe Fire Within / Wen / @yiwen_lin\nZee / Lucas Reveil / @reveil_s\n\nTraits and Trait Names:\n\nAlley / Jinyao Lin / @jinyaolin\nArrangement / Eltono / @eltono\nArt For Walls In Public Spaces / Anna Lucia / @annaluciacodes\nBound / David Brice Allen & ajberni / @davidbriceallen & @ajberni\nA Bugged Forest / Zancan / @zancan\nCellular Automaton / ciphrd / @ciphrd\nCENTURY-XXX-METAMOLNAR(S) / Casey REAS / @reas\nCosmic Type / Mark Webster / @motiondesign_01\nDe/Frag / Karsten Schmidt / @toxi\nDisrupted / rudxane / @rudxane1\nDragons / William Mapan / @williamapan\nEchos / Jeff / @ippsketch\nEnfantines / (rat)chitect - Alejandro / @ratchitect\nGeode & Gossamer / Lars Wander / @larswander\nHashed Cities / Yazid / @Yazid\nHeavy Light / ECKER_O_ / @ecker_o\nHorizon(te)s / Iskra Velitchkova & Zach Lieberman / @pointline_ & @zachlieberman\nHypergiraffe / Piter Pasma / @piterpasma\nImpressions of Order / nbswwit / @nbswwit\nInconvergent / inconvergent / @inconvergent\nMonolith / Ganchitecture & Orr Kislev / @ganchitecture & @OrrKislev\nOde to Random / Yazid / @Yazid\nRepeater / Michael Connolly / @xiiixiii\nSmolskull / Mark Knol / @mknol\nSymmetriclew / abstractment / @abstractment\nTowers / ertdfgcvb / @andreasgysin\nTych / rudxane / @rudxane1",
