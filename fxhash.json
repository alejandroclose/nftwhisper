            "description": "Quasiflock is a 2022 rework of a 2006 realtime animated generative system, originally one of the projects from which later my toxiclibs library collection and some other big client projects & brand identities grew out of. The piece was part of a long, multi-year investigation into particle systems, agents and the aesthetic of fluid dynamics. Even though the approach used here is very primitive, my overall aim was to create a dynamic (and minimally interactive/responsive) system, which is above all mesmerizing to watch and somewhat feels alive. Since the original Java/Processing version isn't able to run anymore, I did some major updates and ported it to Zig & WebAssembly to give it a new life, more fluidity and a larger audience. Hope you enjoy!\n\n10 parametric color themes (each with variations)\n10 macro design/behavioral params (to control dozens more)\noptionally mouse/touch responsive (rotate/pulsate)...\n\nMade w/ Zig, WASM & thi.ng/umbrella",
