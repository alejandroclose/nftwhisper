            "description": "Star Dance\n\nThis is a 100% generative animated project. Its creation was motivated by the beauty depicted in star trail photos that show the rotation of the earth relative to the stars using long exposures. What if the stars left trails like this on their own? What if they danced in intricate patterns?\n\nOne unique feature of this project is a slider that controls how abstract to render the output. It can vary from realistic starscapes to abstract geometric designs.\n\nStar Dance has 40 distinct movement patterns. Each edition gets a set of about 18 patterns that repeat in an irregular fashion until the animation is stopped. The mixing of a new movement pattern with the previous state of the stars yields intricate beautiful designs. The speed can be set to high for an energetic animation or to very slow for a subtle barely noticeable result. The speed and a couple of other settings can be controlled after minting using URL parameters.\n\nThe art will fill the available space and adapt to different aspect ratios.\n\nThe Params define most but not all of the qualities of each edition. The primary things that vary with the random seed are: 1) the specific motion patterns used and their order, 2) the number and positions of trees, 3) the details of some motion patterns (for example there are many different kinds of spirals used), 4) the exact color noise added to the colors defined in the params, 5) position and phase of the moon, 6) accent slashes in the sky.\n\nMost of the parameters are self-explanatory but here are a few things that are not obvious.\n\nThe alpha values for colors are ignored except for the moon and foreground. If they are set to alpha=0 then the moon and foreground do not get drawn.\n\nAbstraction values over 50 use fewer stars but they are drawn using the 'style' parameter which gives each star a more complex appearance. Abstraction values also impact the moon and foreground unless the 'abstraction for' parameter is set to 'stars only'\n\nCoherence controls how many of the stars follow a new movement pattern. At lower coherence values many of the stars will remain as they were after the previous pattern. This can leave visual echos of the previous patterns giving a more complex overall result. At coherence = 100 the stars will all follow the new pattern.\n\nThe theme pattern appears near the beginning and also appears more frequently than the others. Some patterns are less suitable for themes so there are 28 to choose from out of the complete set of 40. The preview image will be taken during the theme pattern.\n\nThe style only affects the star appearance for abstraction levels greater than 50.\n\nWhen the special setting is 'erode foreground' the foreground and moon will gradually dissolve.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis is a 100% code generated project. Outputs are created in using fx(params) but the speed, abstraction, and coherence properties can be adjusted using URL parameters.\n\nThere are some keyboard operations also\n\nClick on the output and use these keys to affect it:\n'f' - freeze/unfreeze\n's' - save a frame\n\nURL Parameters: To change the speed, abstraction, and coherence values add URL parameters like:\n?abstraction=80&speed=20&coherence=80\nThese values will override what was set at the time of minting.\n\nCopyright 2023 Jeff Clark\n--------------------------\n100% generative\n\nAll drawing and geometric code created by Jeff Clark using standard javascript and canvas 2D api. Perlin noise was used with support from perlin.js at https://codepen.io/sixsided/pen/emxxea.js\n\n",

The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",

RATATAT!\n\nA high-energy take on vector field vizualisations, in the form of a short but impactful animation that comes to rest in a highly detailed arrangement of lines, curves, rectangles and dots. A 2.5D and semi-physical approach to the genre, with a focus on realtime performances and clean high resolution captures, clad in a mix of pastel tones, saturated colors, and black lines, for a sort of Roy Lichtenstein / comic book feel.\n\nFully procedural realtime javascript / webgl.\n\nControls :\nAfter the end of the animation, explore the details with :\n- Mouse wheel/middle/ Pinch : Zoom\n- After zoom, Mouse left / Drag : Pan\n- Press \"r\" to restart the animation\n\n- By default, the program tries to adjust the anti-aliasing according to performances. You can press \"a\" to switch between 4 different level of antialising and bypass the auto-adjust.\n- Export a PNG capture at various resolutions by pressing the number keys 1 to 9 (top row or numpad, and only in live mode, after pressing \"open\"). Resolutions ranges from 720 to 7680 pixels for the smallest dimension. I recommend starting with \"4\" and going from there.\n\nMore information on the project origins, composition and techniques here : https://ulucode.com/wp/pow/\n\nAn OK is GPU recommended.

As if we threw these shapes into smoke or fog, they get lost after a while. The symbolism of vanishing is also the texture with which I tried to depict the old canvas, which decays, cracks, and fades after time. \n\nWhy we were happier as children? Thinking back to your childhood, didn't you live in the moment and didn't any day seem long? With each decade, time seemed to speed up. We become more aware of time and forget to live in the moment. Enjoy everything while it lasts, enjoy the forms until they disappear in fog or smoke, enjoy the painter's canvas until it disappears, and enjoy life, because it is finite.\n\nOptions:\n\n- press 's' to save the PNG image of the current view\n- press 'd' to save a hi-res PNG image\n\nCreated using p5.js\nBajiru, March 2023.",

Tip: toggle verbose mode on to see what parameter is connected to the controller.\n\nAvailable controller types:\nknob, drum pad, fader, modwheel, XY, thumbstick, arrow, toggle\n\nParameters to explore (non-exhaustive list)\n- fx: delay, distortion, filter, reverb\n- amplitude and frequency modulation\n- ADSR envelope shaping\n- oscillator specific parameters\n- and many more\n\n///\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES (known bugs, disclaimers and stuff)\n\n- This is an ART project in the first place and so it is not intented to be a professional tool or musical instrument in any way, thus please treat it accordingly.\n- The project uses WebAudio technology, which can be CPU and/or memory-intensive in some cases. Also, browsers may implement it differently, so if you run into bad sound problems (lagging, clipping, extreme distorion etc.) please try another browser or a computer with dedicated sound card if possible. (Created and constantly tested in Safari and Chrome on a 2015 MacBook Pro and 2016 iMac respectively).\n- Sometimes these bad sound problems also occur when your computer audio output is changed on the fly (putting in or pulling out headphones for example). Please restart your browser in this case.\n- Sound recording doesn't always work consistently, causing the recorded file may won't be saved. It is probably a bug I couldn't figure out yet, so this feature should be treated as experimental. If this happens, please reload/restart your browser and try again.\n- The project is fully coded. No additional image or audio resource is used to create the final result.\n- Just have fun and be creative :)\n\n///\n\nCreated with P5.js and P5.sound and using Chirag Mehta's excellent ntc.js (Name that Color Javascript) library. \n\n☁︎\n\ncloudnoise © 2023\n",

Each piece is a visual representation of what lies within the depths of our unconscious minds and uses the power of circles and sacred geometry to symbolize totality, wholeness, and original perfection. By exploring the juxtaposition of depth and flatness, abstraction and figuration, shadow and brightness, this collection encourages us to confront and overcome the parts of ourselves that we may not want to face, but ultimately need to for our growth and healing.",

The artwork and experience draw inspiration from the 'The Pitch Drop Experiment': the world's longest-running laboratory experiment. Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\n____\n\n\nWhile we wait for the 10th drop of pitch to fall in the famous Pitch Drop experiment, I couldn’t avoid thinking about time and change, capturing and preserving a moment of time, the history of art and science, and how we participate in the manipulation of the time itself.  \n\nThe history of new media art is deeply linked to technical developments in photography and its creative applications. With still and moving images, artists were introduced to a new way of visualizing time. Through the use of time lapses, long exposures, slowing down, and fast forwarding, time was manipulated, captured, rearranged, and modified in numerous ways.\n  \nThe French philosopher Henri Bergson believed that reality was in flux and that \"the essence of time is that it goes by.\" His thoughts about time and metaphysics had a significant impact on artists working in all media at the turn of the 20th century. Although he believed in pure perception unaided by machines, and looked down on the introduction of technology into the arts, for artists, who had always been fascinated with the body in space and time, he became their muse. Even before the widespread adoption of technological advances in artistic practices, painters were incorporating aspects of \"movement of time\" into their works (e.g., futurists, Giacomo Balla, but also Marcel Duchamp ). \n\nAnother influential figure for artists was Eadweard Muybridge. In 1878 he photographed a racehorse at full speed, becoming the first to capture what looked like the actual, discrete sequence of motion. After devising the system of several cameras (12 for the first sequence he made), set in a row and arranged to go off in a sequence (with shutters released by pulled strings), he became fascinated with “secrets of time, secrets locked inside basic human movements – a leap, a splash, a walk […]”*. \n\nAll of this inspired me to create and capture algorithmically generated shapes, and record their subtle changes through time and space in the style of vintage scientific illustrations, film strips, long-exposure photos, and comic book panels. Each frame inside this view is one fraction of a second later than the previous one, and the whole frame view is slightly shifted. Your actions inside of the Passage will influence everything, from the number of rows and columns inside of the grid to the color palettes, shapes, and sizes of the objects.\n\n_____\n* Jad Abumrad (host) & Rebecca Solnet (author) say this when they talk about Muybridge in the episode Time, on the Radiolab podcast, aired Aug 24, 2010 (https://radiolab.org/episodes/91584-time)\n",

Which may at once intrigue, impress, intimidate, and inspire.\n\nI am captivated by the mythology of these settings. Where natural shapes appear fantastical. A ridge line drawn by pen meets sky poured out from neon gradient. Where observation is made through the lens of imagination.\n\nEach piece begins with the concept of a mountain landscape. A number of ranges are drawn by pen in one of three styles. Within each style is a spectrum of variation that produces different drawn qualities. The backdrop may be an imagined sky, an impossible sunset, a piece of parchment. A testament to the interpreter’s memory of the scene. \n\n---\n- Made with p5js in the White Mountains of NH July 2022\n- press s to save png\n",
