            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "The first installment of the Self trilogy.\n\nId is defined as: the one of the three divisions of the psyche in psychoanalytic theory that is completely unconscious and is the source of psychic energy derived from instinctual needs and drives.\n\nPlease see attached fx(text) article or go to https://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy for more on concept/mechanics/etc. It’s a bit of long read, but worth it.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

            "description": "Organic Illusion is one of the very first computer graphic drawings I produced that I considered worthy of being called Art. This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory. Like a child you never forget. I submit to you again in new media for you all to enjoy.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "“Arraigos, estudios 2” is part of an exploration process towards the installation project “Arraigos, islas con memoria” that will be showcased in Madrid in October 2023. “Arraigos, islas con memoria” is a project about the immigration process of three Peruvian women artists living in Spain.  The objective is to share a personal perspective on how we bring home and nurture us while involving ourselves in a new environment.\nMy starting point towards the installation, is Legado, a generative art piece I created in 2022 where I explored the legacy of the women in my family and how I integrate it in my present life to take care of myself.\nIn “Arraigos, estudios 2” I go back to a classroom, my notebooks, and my pens. From that place I just drew lines, free lines, wondering lines. I keep drawing them. They bring me home.\nI always chose graph paper, even to write and there used to be four common pen colors in my school days: blue, black, red, and green.  That is the palette I have created for this mint.\nPress from “1” to “7” to render at higher resolutions. \nPress “s” to save a .png file at you given resolution.\n",

Or maybe it's all the drugs.\n\nA semi-abstract semi-figurative look at the city, either a cage or an ocean of possibilities, under a future sky that alternately oppresses and inspires.\n\n------- Viewport controls ( mobile in parenthesis ) -------\n- Mouse Wheel/Middle (Pinch) to zoom\n- Mouse left and drag (Two fingers drag) to pan (after zooming in).\n\n------- Menu -------\n!!! Press SPACE to show/hide the MENU. !!!\n\nIn this MENU you can :\n\n- Adjust the anti-aliasing quality : Default is \"medium\". Set it to \"ideal\" for optimal quality.\n- Aspect ratio : you can change the desired aspect ratio from the default \"Poster\" to \"Window\", in which case the piece resizes itself to fill the window in which it is displayed. Useful if you want to capture in other formats. It has its limits though, extreme ratios will be weird.\n- Display frame : toggle to hide/show the frame\n- Display stats : toggle to display a small FPS counter in the top left.\n- Export : choose the resolution and press the \"Export capture\" button to export a PNG of what is currently displayed. Warning : large resolutions can take a few seconds and weigh around 400Mo. This is the recommended method if you want CLEAN graphic files.\n\n------ Params ------\nFirst get a feel for the generator like for any gentk. Then I'd recommend picking a palette and locking it, then start playing with the different options and progressively lock them. Finally, either play with the fxhash seed or the \"Override seed\" parameter.\n\nThe \"Override seed\" param : Leave blank if you want to be surprised by your mint and design only a general look. Inversely, if you want to mint the precise artwork you see while designing, this field should have a value in it.\n\nNFT License\n\nRuns on Three.js : https://threejs.org/\nGUI uses lil-gui : https://www.npmjs.com/package/lil-gui",

            "description": "“Arraigos, estudios 2” is part of an exploration process towards the installation project “Arraigos, islas con memoria” that will be showcased in Madrid in October 2023. “Arraigos, islas con memoria” is a project about the immigration process of three Peruvian women artists living in Spain.  The objective is to share a personal perspective on how we bring home and nurture us while involving ourselves in a new environment.\nMy starting point towards the installation, is Legado, a generative art piece I created in 2022 where I explored the legacy of the women in my family and how I integrate it in my present life to take care of myself.\nIn “Arraigos, estudios 2” I go back to a classroom, my notebooks, and my pens. From that place I just drew lines, free lines, wondering lines. I keep drawing them. They bring me home.\nI always chose graph paper, even to write and there used to be four common pen colors in my school days: blue, black, red, and green.  That is the palette I have created for this mint.\nPress from “1” to “7” to render at higher resolutions. \nPress “s” to save a .png file at you given resolution.\n",

We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it. Thank you very much for collecting and for your continuous support.\n\n10% of primary and secondary sales will go to fxhash team; thank you for what you are doing.\n\nSelf reserved pieces are for promised gifts to my collectors.\n\nPress S to save as PNG.
