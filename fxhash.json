There is a legend in the East that before Pan Gu opened up the sky and created the earth, the world was a chaotic place, and no one knew its appearance. And I have always been fascinated by this mythical story since he was a child.\n\nThese three works have a father-son relationship, Research > Memory > Culture, with each work re-growing through the remnants of the previous work, depending on its image. From the beginning of the creative coding, I like the concept of recursion the most. Here I experiment with my central thinking through this iterative relationship so that the work is not only the shadow of the artist but also the pulling force of repetition.\n\n\"Ê∑∑Ê≤å\" Chaos in Eastern culture represents the initial state of things. This state is consistent with what we believe in generative art: Anything can happen if different forces are applied. Letting chaos grow out of order and then destroying it, the iterative process, is like my usual dialogue with myself, and maybe it's all just a diary.\n\nThrough these three series of works, whether I can eventually find everything in my childhood fantasy, I am not sure yet. The only thing I can be sure of is that I will continue to explore.\n\n- Click the mouse to save an artwork.\n- Collectors who own this NFT have the right to print the work.\n\nArtist: Aluan Wang (ileivoivm).\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

After that made this generative stuff for fxhash's birthday bash.\n\n#fxhashturnsone\n\nDonations:\n25% to ThreeJs team\n\nThe image contains a binary coded word or phrase with a length of 8 characters. The grays represents 0, the other colors represents 1. One row -> one character. Should be proceed decoding from left to right and from top to bottom.\n\nAn example: 'iloveyou'\n\n01101001\n01101100\n01101111\n01110110\n01100101\n01111001\n01101111\n01110101\n\nThe fxrandom selects a word and the program converts it to binary data. After that, the background (ground and sky) is randomly generated from color schemes. Then the binary gray colors are drawn. Also the color of light next to null colors is randomly generated from color schemes. Random affects also the animation.\n\nThe animation stops when you do these interactions below, then restarts after a few seconds of inactivity.\n\nPress spacebar to change:\n\n- frame view -> without frame\n- without frame -> original 8x8px size\n- original 8x8px size -> frame view\n\nPress 's' to save an svg from current view.\n\nNotes:\n- Build with ReactJs and TweenJs\n- Every upcoming day, half of the remaining pieces are burned.\n\nHappy Birthday fxhash community!\nI'm glad to be among you!",

            "description": "This collection of low resolution generative art is presented using emojis rather than an image, so it can be copied like normal text. You are also welcome to take a screenshot for sharing or printing. Most results are designed to fit in a 280 character tweet, except for rare extra large variants. There are five different generative algorithms possible, each with their own set of parameters. Emojis are rendered using the Twemoji font and may look different in some environments.\n\nThank you for supporting my work during the first year of fxhash. For me it has been a life changing experience. I am forever grateful for all of the art and friendships we've created. Many of us have met on social media, so I developed this special project with a fun way to display and share. Congrats to artists, collectors, and developers for an amazing year!\n\nThis work is part of the fxhash anniversary event (#fxhashturnsone)\nAll of primary sale proceeds will go to Save Pakistan\n\nCode and Outputs are Copyright 2022 Frank Force\nArtwork is released under CC BY-NC 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0)\nTwemoji Graphics licensed under CC-BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)",

            "description": "At moment we decide to draw a square on top of a circle, we are defining a time arrow, a third dimension on the 2D plane, where shapes can be on o top of each other, come one after the other. In this project i wanted to remove that time arrow, that third dimension, and leave the 2D plane as flat as possible.\n\nShapes are not drawn in sequence, they are formed by the continuous addition of points to each region defined by the shapes intersections. Not a single region is on top of the other. They are the result of the combination of shapes, and defined by them. Horizontal, decentralized societies. Espacios comunes. We can see the circles, squares, plane cuts, but we cannot give them an order or authority.\n\n-----\n\nKey controls:\n\n- UP arrow: Increases the sketch resolution. It will take longer to render but it will produce better quality images.\n- DOWN arrow: Decreases the sketch resolution.\n- f: Removes or adds an empty frame around the image.\n- d: Increases the points density. More points will be painted and regions will become more full.\n- n: Increases the pixel noise.\n- b: Decreases the pixel noise.\n- z: Switches on and off the simple pixel sorting algorithm. Move the mouse left and right to change the pixel stickiness.\n- x: Switches on and off a more complex version of the pixel sorting algorithm.\n- i: Displays some log information.\n- p: Pauses the sketch.\n- s: Saves a screenshot of the artwork. The image resolution will depend on the sketch resolution, which is controlled by the UP and DOWN arrows.\n\n-----\n\nURL controls:\n\nwidth=2000 will set the sketch width to 2000 pixels.\nproportion=2.3 will set the sketch width-to-height ratio to 2.3.\nYou can combine these two parameters to create any image output you want. For example, to create an image that is 3000 pixels wide and 5000 pixels high, one just needs to add &width=3000&proportion=0.6 to the URL.\n\n-----\n\nSpecial thanks to @andregorayeb (Gora) and @ItonkStudio (Itonk) for letting me use some of their color palettes for this project.\n\n-----\n\nLicense: CC BY 4.0\n\nThis project makes use of the p5.js library.

            "description": "‚ÄúFelix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas‚Äù\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state ‚Äì heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil‚Äôs quote from the beginning translates to: ‚ÄúFortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things‚Äù. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP üññ\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 ‚Äì 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz‚Äôs ‚Äúadrift‚Äù, lunarean's ‚ÄúHeat Death‚Äù, and Monotau‚Äôs ‚ÄúCradle‚Äù collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

This \"non-place\", traversed by layers, is solidified in the images, almost like a truce from the endless war of this inconstancy.\nthere is no winner\" Raffa Gomes\n\nGenerative Token by of Morbeck for fxhash\n\naugust 21, 2022",
