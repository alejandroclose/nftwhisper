            "description": "Everything is divisible. Larger organisms are made up of smaller ones, entire galaxies are comprised of stars, planets, people, dust, and one effect here and now ripples into eternity. Nothing exists without the elemental components that have evolved to make them possible — and nothing on the plane of existence arrives in isolation from something greater. This enmeshed reality is the concept of a Holon: a whole that is simultaneously part of another whole. \n\nAs cells, energies, beings, and ideas grow in complexity, each new advancement includes and transcends their holons, the very catalysts of evolution. What does this essential process look like on its own when scale, context, and definition are removed? The senses are forced to purely observe the present interactions and reactions that occur between all parts. This is what Holons attempts to portray — the witnessing of birth, formation, and crystallization simultaneously. \n\nUpon viewing each piece and inspecting its detail with curiosity — we can observe living reality that has been temporarily suspended from motion and artificially stopped for us to witness. Can we see what is a part, and what is a whole? Can we define what these holons are? \n\nLet each Holons remind us that the impossible can always be made; let each one be nothing and everything — organisms, cosmos, energy itself — all at once, for it’s the creation of something entirely new that best reminds us that everything is actually made of the parts already here. So, remember to create without barriers or limitations because reality itself is made of that which lives now only in imagination.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x flight404\nOctober 2022\n\nPress ‘h’ in live view to render a high resolution version of any token.\nPress ‘s’ in live view to save a .png of the current view of any token.\n\nHolons was created in vanilla Javascript and WebGL, but the majority of the work was done in GLSL shaders. This setup was substantially assisted by fx(hash) community leader and artist Liam Egan who provided technical assistance and emotional support during the project's lifespan. For this reason, we have included him in the split of proceeds.\n",

Mint or collect “fx(haish) - the Generator”\nStep 2. Visit https://www.arqtistic.com/fx(haish) to generate your “fx(haish) - The AI City” based on your mint. You have 20 tries.\nStep 3. Await further instructions.\n\n\n// FURTHER INFO\n\nThis algorithm has been designed to produce images which are suitable for the subsequent AI generation. The token consists of a random number of randomly placed and sized rectangles, filled with a noise gradient pattern. In short, Diffusion AI Models thrive on noise.\n\nThe AI generation uses Stable Diffusion 1.5 through an API designed by the 330ai team (@Pixelmindai). The WebUI has been developed by Nik0gda (@AntonCebanu2). AI Prompt has been designed (by me) to produce images of Cities, but you can possibly make it do other things, if you try hard enough.",

            "description": "The second piece in this series is dedicated to another fundamental algorithm in computer graphics: Voronoi. It's origin precedes its use with computers by several decades, or centuries, depending on who to credit, since science always is a continuum. In the generative art & design field, the algorithm has been an instrumental tool for generation(s) of practioners, sadly often to the point of turning cliché.\n\nIn this piece I've attempted to \"break\" the classic resulting aesthetics of this algorithm and focus more on revealing its inner workings. There are many ways of computing a Voronoi diagram. The so called Jump Flood Algorithm (JFA) proved to be the visually most interesting approach to me. Again, as with the previous De/Frag piece, here the algorithm has been slowed down, timesliced and customized in dozens of ways to result in a more painterly character overall and produce a variety of new shapes & textures.\n\nFullscreen compatible (Press 'S' to toggle square frame).

            "description": "A generative, impressionist painting of a small grove of trees in one of the four seasons. In spring and summer, flowers bloom in the meadow. A rare variation will create a charcoal drawing on white or black paper. Super rare will create a lighted winter scene that may have a moon behind the tree.\n\nViewing in desktop Chrome is recommended for the best results.\n\nPress 's' to save a screenshot at any point. Image size is 1400x1082px.\n\nAdd '&size=#' to the end of the live view URL to render a variation of your edition at a resolution from 300 to 3,000 px.\n\nOn the paintings only, adding '&bg=true' will stop the painting after the background. Adding '&size=3000&bg=true' will give you a nice desktop background! \n\nCommon Features:\n- About 12-14 trees\n- One of the four seasons\n- One of 12 highlight color tints\n- One of 12 shadow color tints\n- Varying levels of distance haze\n- Varying max brush sizes\n- Varying amount of colors in the strokes\n\nLess Common\n- 15% chance of a charcoal drawing\n- 50% chance it to be a dark winter scene\n\nRare\n- Winter drawing with lights on the tree\n\nSuper Rare\n- Winter drawing with a moon behind the tree\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Matt Perkins, hello@mattperkins.me, @nudoru on Twitter.

            "description": "The <iframe> HTML element is an element that allows a web document to embed the contents of another web document within itself. iframes are at the core of fxhash. They are portals opening our view to rich content.\n\nThis work is a portal to itself. It loads itself within itself 20 times. It's not pretty, it reminds us of WordArt, it's a little bit hacky, it might break when our tools to display HTML will change. But it's a proof that the limits of our tools are only limits until creativity breaks them.\n\nThis work is not purely deterministic, because it simply cannot be. Slight timing differences due to loading times being different each time an <iframe> is loaded will make each visualization slightly unique.\n\nIf you view this token on mobile, the nesting limit was reduced to 4 to prevent performance issues.\n\nThis work is highly experimental. It leverages a \"hack\" to allow iframes to be nested.\nFirefox max <iframe> nesting depth as of 28/12/2021 is capped at 9.\nWorks with chrome desktop 96.0.4664.110",
