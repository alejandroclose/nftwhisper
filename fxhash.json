            "description": "I side with the idea that we made this reality so weird merely to satisfy our -psychotic- need to overcomplicate things. Not you, of course.\n\nThat's why I believe that our choices don't \"create our own path\" but a maze for others to (try to) solve.\nThis God or that One or none, the old songs or the new ones, rooting for or against…\nThe deepest we meet into each other's maze, the more choices we share. Reciprocally, when we lack the interest to explore even a couple of turns, we're but a first impression to each other.\n\nThis work examines those ideas by continually presenting options to N individuals and then tracking their choices, which in turn generates different outputs at different depths.\n\nTo access them:\n- press \"S\" for story mode, the sequence of choices\n  - then, press \"1\" through \"5\" to change the speed\n- press \"L\" for landscape, the first impression\n- press \"D\" to see the details and view the mazes (may take a while)",

The code tries to replicate not only the style, but also the process and inaccuracies that go into a drawing.\n\nEach iteration has a unique title. \nAll 256 rendered outputs and their respective titles will be displayed in high quality on https://twistie.org/lineage. \n\n10 lucky owners will have their iteration hand drawn and signed. They will each receive the physical 1/1 as well as an NFT version.\n\nPress 's' on keyboard to save in high-res. This is how the art is intended to be viewed.\n\nHardware acceleration on Chromium-based browsers can impact performance!",

            "description": "✧ TWISTINGS ✧\n\nTwistings, the \"Explore Variety\" collection, explores the beauty & variety that is hidden within the simple math of Archimedean spirals.\n\nThere are seven different circular \"entities\", each brought forward by using slightly different mathematical settings of the spiral formulas: Drops, Circles, Fireworks, Flowers, Roses, Spirals & Twisters.\n\n____\n\n✧ CURATED / RANDOM ✧\n\nI love both the concept of a heavily curated set, hand picked by the artist, the best representation / the most beautiful, but also the concept of the larger, random collections showing the variety hidden within the algorithm.\n\nI've therefore also released an \"Artist Curated\" collection of 7 pieces that I meticulously hand-picked from over 1000 outputs. You can find these on the platform 1stDibs.com/nft (under my name \"nadieh\"). They represent my favorite for each of the seven unique entities. A free mint of this \"Explore Variety\" collection will be airdropped to each buyer of a \"Curated\" piece.\n\n____\n\n✧ OPTIONS ✧\n\nn - Toggle grainy noise on/off (on by default, it's subtle to see)\n\ns - Save the image at the current window size and pixel density\n\nTo save a larger image you can add the parameter `&pixeldensity=2` (or another number) to the end of the URL when viewed on the live page. Afterwards press \"s\" to save the image. The number is the factor with which the width and height are increased w.r.t. the current window size.\n\n-- The larger the image / pixeldensity, the longer it will take to create & save --\n\n____\n\n✧ NOTES ✧\n\nIt works best and fastest in Firefox!\n\nAs of the drop day there is a browser bug for Chrome on the ARM Apple laptops. It incorrectly visualizes certain color blend modes. The following color palettes are affected: Antique, Camping, Pastel, Prime & Rainbow. I hope/assume this will be fixed soon. \n\n____\n\nCreated by Nadieh Bremer\nTwitter & Instagram: @NadiehBremer\nWebsite: VisualCinnamon.com",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "✧ TWISTINGS ✧\n\nTwistings, the \"Explore Variety\" collection, explores the beauty & variety that is hidden within the simple math of Archimedean spirals.\n\nThere are seven different circular \"entities\", each brought forward by using slightly different mathematical settings of the spiral formulas: Drops, Circles, Fireworks, Flowers, Roses, Spirals & Twisters.\n\n____\n\n✧ CURATED / RANDOM ✧\n\nI love both the concept of a heavily curated set, hand picked by the artist, the best representation / the most beautiful, but also the concept of the larger, random collections showing the variety hidden within the algorithm.\n\nI've therefore also released an \"Artist Curated\" collection of 7 pieces that I meticulously hand-picked from over 1000 outputs. You can find these on the platform 1stDibs.com/nft (under my name \"nadieh\"). They represent my favorite for each of the seven unique entities. A free mint of this \"Explore Variety\" collection will be airdropped to each buyer of a \"Curated\" piece.\n\n____\n\n✧ OPTIONS ✧\n\nn - Toggle grainy noise on/off (on by default, it's subtle to see)\n\ns - Save the image at the current window size and pixel density\n\nTo save a larger image you can add the parameter `&pixeldensity=2` (or another number) to the end of the URL when viewed on the live page. Afterwards press \"s\" to save the image. The number is the factor with which the width and height are increased w.r.t. the current window size.\n\n-- The larger the image / pixeldensity, the longer it will take to create & save --\n\n____\n\n✧ NOTES ✧\n\nIt works best and fastest in Firefox!\n\nAs of the drop day there is a browser bug for Chrome on the ARM Apple laptops. It incorrectly visualizes certain color blend modes. The following color palettes are affected: Antique, Camping, Pastel, Prime & Rainbow. I hope/assume this will be fixed soon. \n\n____\n\nCreated by Nadieh Bremer\nTwitter & Instagram: @NadiehBremer\nWebsite: VisualCinnamon.com",

So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n\"A statistical evaluation would be interesting. Please email me with your results for the optimal proportion.\"\n\nI found it heartwarming that in 2011, Herbert W. Franke wrote the above, accompanied with a simple functional program on a Wolfram Demonstration page (https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/IsTheGoldenRatioReallyTheMostBeautifulProportion/) titled 'Is the Golden Ratio Really the Most Beautiful Proportion?' and invited people to submit their findings to him.\n\nThe main idea behind this project is ratios, a variety of them, used in a variety of ways, such as how a rectangle is repeatedly subdivided, or how it influences the aspect ratio of the piece, or how the colors in a palette are selected. These are represented in various styles, some of which are inspired by the aesthetic of Herbert W. Franke's diverse artworks, and his openness to experimentation with new technologies, such as plotter drawings, screens, screenprints, or 2D and 3D digital renderings.\n\nThis project, while not designed to be a formal statistical evaluation, is but my fun, colorful, and humble response to your inquiry, dear Herbert.\n\n---\n\n25% of primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke, with the goal of raising 20,000 Euros so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any money raised beyond this goal will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• Double-click/tap or 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n\nNote: Some mints require WEBGL and/or may take several seconds to fully render.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid",
