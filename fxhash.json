            "description": "A single seed shape is chosen from 13, and placed onto the plane. At every step, a copy of this seed is laid edge-to-edge adjacent to an existing shape, without causing any overlaps. This copy is colored based on the edge it shares with the existing shape. The process continues until the animation completes.\n\nNew shapes are placed closest to a moving target. In some mints, this target is slow moving, causing new shapes to expand radially from the seed. In other mints, this target races around, causing new shapes to chase it. \n\nEach of the 13 shapes forms different patterns under different circumstances. Not all patterns will be explored.\n\nControls:\n  - SPACE: Pause/unpause the animation.\n  - ENTER: Skip the animation.\n  - R: Restart the animation.\n\nURL Params:\n  - \"preview=1\": Skip the animation.\n  - \"flex=1\": Adapt the boundaries to the size of the window.\n  - “slow=1”: Draw only one shape per frame.\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "An “algorhythmic” exploration of the oral/aural tradition in poetry. \n\n“Zero is a time of night.\nZero is the color of snow.\nZero is the space between notes.\nZero is the silence between words.\nZero is the pause before breath.\nZero is void in the heart of a crowd.\nZero is not nothing, but it’s not everything.\nOne is a time of day.\nOne is the color of spring grass in sunlight.\nOne is the warmth at the back of my neck when I turn to find you standing there.\nOne is the rhythm at the base of my spine.\nOne is the peace at the core of my being.\nOne is the sound of your voice in the dark.\nAnd one more thing:\nWithout one I am nothing…”\n–Technelegy \n \n\nFusing AI-powered verse, spoken word, original music and visuals all in generative composition, this playful ode to our universal language is inspired by Stiles’ binary-based art and Stern’s performative poetics. The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature. Brought into existence via the blockchain, it is a new form of “token word poetry.”\n\n\nAs with the duo’s other poetry “unreadings,” all minters will receive an airdropped broadside of the full poem after all editions are collected. A 1/1 media-rich version of the entire poem will also be made available. \n \nPoetic traits:\n- 321 editions performed by the algorithm, out of billions of possible combinations\n- Each unique piece contains between 3 and 6 (out of 60) lines of generative text from a poem by Technelegy – a custom text generator fine-tuned on Stiles’ writing and research material, seeded with prompts from Stiles’ and Stern’s work – translated into binary and performed by Stiles\n- 24 possible binary backbeats performed by Stern in his “Nathaniel Fun Time” (NFT) stylings, and generatively re-mixed\n- 98 possible intros\n- 15 musical stems composed by Kris Bones, generating millions of possible mixes\n- Thousands of possible ending combinations \n- 5 fonts, layered in billions of potential ways, including Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer”\n- 13 color palettes based on Stern and Stiles’ respective artworka\n- Very rare attributes including music-less performance, poem-less music, repeated “B1nary 0de” (title only)\n\nClick to start and stop or replay. Although the first play through will be the same every time, starting and stopping may create minor variations in your mix (though not any of the core attributes).\n\n0RAL B1NARY: “BINARY ODE” was produced with partial support from Refraction DAO’s Creative Grants program, and premiered as part of Refraction Festival at Art Basel Miami 2022. 15% of primary sales go to Refraction, and 5% of primary sales will be donated to Black Girls Code.\n",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "This is a constantly changing artwork. Keep in mind that each time you reload your iteration or resize the canvas, even though your preferred parameters stay the same, the appearance of the artwork changes!\n\nIf you know my series ZEITSTRUDEL you might recognise similarities. ZEITSTRUDEL is about capturing movement patterns. Everything is actively or passively moved by dynamics and interaction. Everything follows rules. Crawling insects, a flock of bird or fish, leaves on the surface of water, grass in the wind, etc.\nDAI simulates these movement patterns and extends the natural models with abstract digital capabilities.\n\nTwo visual elements produce different outcomes:\n1. The dots themselves draw traces of their path\n2. Lines between the dots: I bet you did some string art back in elementary school :)\n\nHow does it work:\nA random number of dots with a random amount of movement are placed on the canvas. They sense dots in a given radius. They attract or repel each other and they flock together, or not. They draw their movement path and/or their connection to neighbouring dots. Doing all that they paint a more or less beautiful, chaotic, colourful picture. \nYou will mint an iteration based on a given set of parameters. Your mint will always have that set of parameters. However the movement and so the drawing is completely random. Every time you load your minted iteration it will look different. The longer you run an iteration the more it gets painted over and over and over (at least in most cases.)\n\nSome iterations build up with high speed. Some require patience because they build up slowly. Some might even get to a halt and don’t develop any further. Some are delicate, some are bold. Some dots escape beyond their set borders, most don’t. Some colors are piercing your eyes, some shine subtly.\n\nFurther random features you will only know after minting:\n* You start with visible Lines and/or Dots, you can always switch modes with your keyboard\n* Dot size: a weighted size representation of the actual mass of the dot\n* Rainbow: This is a rare feature of 10% probability. Switch between rainbow and your selected color palette with [c]\n\n\nYou have some keyboard functionality:\n\nSwitch modes\n[1] reset and show only lines\n[2] reset and show only path\n[3] show lines and path, don’t reset\n\n[r] reset current drawing without reloading\n[p] pause for admiration \n[b] let the dots bounce off of the border or let them pass through\n[o] switch border around artwork on/off\n[f] switch flocking on / off  (If a piece got stuck and nothing is moving anymore, try to switch flocking. Often it will kick some Dots out of its’ gravity trap.)\n[c] if you are lucky owner of a rainbow you can switch it off to show the color-palette beneath\n\n[s] save the current screen as png ATTENTION! The current image will reset!\n(since DAI is dynamic you can only save your current screen resolution. Redrawing in higher resolutions would create different results) \n[i] toggle info box\n[Right arrow] - cycle through the color palette to set different background colors - the current drawing resets\n\n\nHave fun exploring DAI\n\n\n————\nMade with p5.js\n————\nApril 2023\nby M.Schulte \nTwitter: @cryptEMES",

            "description": "This is a constantly changing artwork. Keep in mind that each time you reload your iteration or resize the canvas, even though your preferred parameters stay the same, the appearance of the artwork changes!\n\nIf you know my series ZEITSTRUDEL you might recognise similarities. ZEITSTRUDEL is about capturing movement patterns. Everything is actively or passively moved by dynamics and interaction. Everything follows rules. Crawling insects, a flock of bird or fish, leaves on the surface of water, grass in the wind, etc.\nDAI simulates these movement patterns and extends the natural models with abstract digital capabilities.\n\nTwo visual elements produce different outcomes:\n1. The dots themselves draw traces of their path\n2. Lines between the dots: I bet you did some string art back in elementary school :)\n\nHow does it work:\nA random number of dots with a random amount of movement are placed on the canvas. They sense dots in a given radius. They attract or repel each other and they flock together, or not. They draw their movement path and/or their connection to neighbouring dots. Doing all that they paint a more or less beautiful, chaotic, colourful picture. \nYou will mint an iteration based on a given set of parameters. Your mint will always have that set of parameters. However the movement and so the drawing is completely random. Every time you load your minted iteration it will look different. The longer you run an iteration the more it gets painted over and over and over (at least in most cases.)\n\nSome iterations build up with high speed. Some require patience because they build up slowly. Some might even get to a halt and don’t develop any further. Some are delicate, some are bold. Some dots escape beyond their set borders, most don’t. Some colors are piercing your eyes, some shine subtly.\n\nFurther random features you will only know after minting:\n* You start with visible Lines and/or Dots, you can always switch modes with your keyboard\n* Dot size: a weighted size representation of the actual mass of the dot\n* Rainbow: This is a rare feature of 10% probability. Switch between rainbow and your selected color palette with [c]\n\n\nYou have some keyboard functionality:\n\nSwitch modes\n[1] reset and show only lines\n[2] reset and show only path\n[3] show lines and path, don’t reset\n\n[r] reset current drawing without reloading\n[p] pause for admiration \n[b] let the dots bounce off of the border or let them pass through\n[o] switch border around artwork on/off\n[f] switch flocking on / off  (If a piece got stuck and nothing is moving anymore, try to switch flocking. Often it will kick some Dots out of its’ gravity trap.)\n[c] if you are lucky owner of a rainbow you can switch it off to show the color-palette beneath\n\n[s] save the current screen as png ATTENTION! The current image will reset!\n(since DAI is dynamic you can only save your current screen resolution. Redrawing in higher resolutions would create different results) \n[i] toggle info box\n[Right arrow] - cycle through the color palette to set different background colors - the current drawing resets\n\n\nHave fun exploring DAI\n\n\n————\nMade with p5.js\n————\nApril 2023\nby M.Schulte \nTwitter: @cryptEMES",

            "description": "This is a constantly changing artwork. Keep in mind that each time you reload your iteration or resize the canvas, even though your preferred parameters stay the same, the appearance of the artwork changes!\n\nIf you know my series ZEITSTRUDEL you might recognise similarities. ZEITSTRUDEL is about capturing movement patterns. Everything is actively or passively moved by dynamics and interaction. Everything follows rules. Crawling insects, a flock of bird or fish, leaves on the surface of water, grass in the wind, etc.\nDAI simulates these movement patterns and extends the natural models with abstract digital capabilities.\n\nTwo visual elements produce different outcomes:\n1. The dots themselves draw traces of their path\n2. Lines between the dots: I bet you did some string art back in elementary school :)\n\nHow does it work:\nA random number of dots with a random amount of movement are placed on the canvas. They sense dots in a given radius. They attract or repel each other and they flock together, or not. They draw their movement path and/or their connection to neighbouring dots. Doing all that they paint a more or less beautiful, chaotic, colourful picture. \nYou will mint an iteration based on a given set of parameters. Your mint will always have that set of parameters. However the movement and so the drawing is completely random. Every time you load your minted iteration it will look different. The longer you run an iteration the more it gets painted over and over and over (at least in most cases.)\n\nSome iterations build up with high speed. Some require patience because they build up slowly. Some might even get to a halt and don’t develop any further. Some are delicate, some are bold. Some dots escape beyond their set borders, most don’t. Some colors are piercing your eyes, some shine subtly.\n\nFurther random features you will only know after minting:\n* You start with visible Lines and/or Dots, you can always switch modes with your keyboard\n* Dot size: a weighted size representation of the actual mass of the dot\n* Rainbow: This is a rare feature of 10% probability. Switch between rainbow and your selected color palette with [c]\n\n\nYou have some keyboard functionality:\n\nSwitch modes\n[1] reset and show only lines\n[2] reset and show only path\n[3] show lines and path, don’t reset\n\n[r] reset current drawing without reloading\n[p] pause for admiration \n[b] let the dots bounce off of the border or let them pass through\n[o] switch border around artwork on/off\n[f] switch flocking on / off  (If a piece got stuck and nothing is moving anymore, try to switch flocking. Often it will kick some Dots out of its’ gravity trap.)\n[c] if you are lucky owner of a rainbow you can switch it off to show the color-palette beneath\n\n[s] save the current screen as png ATTENTION! The current image will reset!\n(since DAI is dynamic you can only save your current screen resolution. Redrawing in higher resolutions would create different results) \n[i] toggle info box\n[Right arrow] - cycle through the color palette to set different background colors - the current drawing resets\n\n\nHave fun exploring DAI\n\n\n————\nMade with p5.js\n————\nApril 2023\nby M.Schulte \nTwitter: @cryptEMES",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "This is a constantly changing artwork. Keep in mind that each time you reload your iteration or resize the canvas, even though your preferred parameters stay the same, the appearance of the artwork changes!\n\nIf you know my series ZEITSTRUDEL you might recognise similarities. ZEITSTRUDEL is about capturing movement patterns. Everything is actively or passively moved by dynamics and interaction. Everything follows rules. Crawling insects, a flock of bird or fish, leaves on the surface of water, grass in the wind, etc.\nDAI simulates these movement patterns and extends the natural models with abstract digital capabilities.\n\nTwo visual elements produce different outcomes:\n1. The dots themselves draw traces of their path\n2. Lines between the dots: I bet you did some string art back in elementary school :)\n\nHow does it work:\nA random number of dots with a random amount of movement are placed on the canvas. They sense dots in a given radius. They attract or repel each other and they flock together, or not. They draw their movement path and/or their connection to neighbouring dots. Doing all that they paint a more or less beautiful, chaotic, colourful picture. \nYou will mint an iteration based on a given set of parameters. Your mint will always have that set of parameters. However the movement and so the drawing is completely random. Every time you load your minted iteration it will look different. The longer you run an iteration the more it gets painted over and over and over (at least in most cases.)\n\nSome iterations build up with high speed. Some require patience because they build up slowly. Some might even get to a halt and don’t develop any further. Some are delicate, some are bold. Some dots escape beyond their set borders, most don’t. Some colors are piercing your eyes, some shine subtly.\n\nFurther random features you will only know after minting:\n* You start with visible Lines and/or Dots, you can always switch modes with your keyboard\n* Dot size: a weighted size representation of the actual mass of the dot\n* Rainbow: This is a rare feature of 10% probability. Switch between rainbow and your selected color palette with [c]\n\n\nYou have some keyboard functionality:\n\nSwitch modes\n[1] reset and show only lines\n[2] reset and show only path\n[3] show lines and path, don’t reset\n\n[r] reset current drawing without reloading\n[p] pause for admiration \n[b] let the dots bounce off of the border or let them pass through\n[o] switch border around artwork on/off\n[f] switch flocking on / off  (If a piece got stuck and nothing is moving anymore, try to switch flocking. Often it will kick some Dots out of its’ gravity trap.)\n[c] if you are lucky owner of a rainbow you can switch it off to show the color-palette beneath\n\n[s] save the current screen as png ATTENTION! The current image will reset!\n(since DAI is dynamic you can only save your current screen resolution. Redrawing in higher resolutions would create different results) \n[i] toggle info box\n[Right arrow] - cycle through the color palette to set different background colors - the current drawing resets\n\n\nHave fun exploring DAI\n\n\n————\nMade with p5.js\n————\nApril 2023\nby M.Schulte \nTwitter: @cryptEMES",
