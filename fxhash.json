            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

This is the beginning of the production of fascinating works that we have been working on for several projects for months. In the background of this piece, there is a combination of Mondrian's known works with his well-known color palette and style, and the compositions try to remember Mondrian's works and create new and different designs. This deconstruction of The style Art movement continued and flourished with his other contemporary artists; Fx Hash's one-year candle combines de Stijl's work with a new pattern that creates new compositions independent of this work.\n\nUnique collection by ArashMp and Chistai for #fxhashturnsone\nHappy birthday fx(hash)!\n#fxhashturnsone\n\n\n✅ you can save the image in the following sizes:\n⌨️ Key number 1️⃣ 1000✖️1000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number 2️⃣ 2000✖️2000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number 3️⃣ 3000✖️3000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number 4️⃣ 4000✖️4000 pixels\n\n\nLicense: (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) \nmade by p5js\nNovember 2022",

It's a search for creating harmonies and disharmonies by combining 3 colors with 3 unsynchronized mathematical equations. Udnē explores the beauty within triadic compositions while attempting to integrate two contrasting textures by forming instances of non-figurative scenes. The collection is a reflection of integrated and contrasting textures in micro and macro scale that we see in our everyday life environment.\n\nYou can press 's' in liveMode to save as 1000x1000px .png.\n\nIn liveMode, add '&density=7’ to the end of the URL to render at high resolution (7000x7000px). You can use 5, 7 or 10 for different resolutions. It will automatically download when the rendering is finished. \n\nSome compositions might take longer to render in low-performance computers. Please be patient and enjoy the process!\n\nAs a rare probability there is an intentionally kept glitch.\n\nMade with p5js.\n@distcollective, November 2022\n",

            "description": "We cannot compose life, at best we hum along to the melodies that life has been played in front of us. Looking back at the scores of our lives, the notations are never neatly noted, but fully felt.  Rewinding the songs of life are our memories, whether sad, happy, angry, or melancholy. It is not clear whether I am dreaming or awake, but our songs all do end. \n\nIn this final drop (for ?), I have reused the first ever class calligraphy(){} I have written from my genesis drop “Nothing comes from nothing”. As time passes, 10 drops later, across almost to the year, I am grateful for the progress I have made, as an artist, and more importantly as a human. After all, what is behind the code of generative art is a human being. \n\nScores of music, scrolls of calligraphy, calendar or diary, notating life, time passes, and changes are inevitable. Sometimes we sing louder in laughter and joy, sometimes we scribble in uneasiness, sometimes we just get lost in neon lights. Life goes on. You and me, all the same and yet different.  \n\nThere are too many friend artists, friend collectors, fxhash team members, to thank for helping me through this journey. I would like to pay homage to Rudxane in this work, who has taken me under his wings, mentoring and encouraging me in art as well as showing me some degen stuff on the side:-). This homage is not copy-minting, or copying of styles, which I do not have the coding skills to do so even if I wanted to. But it is the influence of taste in many works of Rudxane. In a vague but agreeable taste, I present to you Life has no scores. \n\nWhat I was taught was disrupted, and grid studies left unfinished, and oh do we have a BINGO?\n\nTested on Chrome.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

This is the beginning of the production of fascinating works that we have been working on for several projects for months. In the background of this piece, there is a combination of Mondrian's known works with his well-known color palette and style, and the compositions try to remember Mondrian's works and create new and different designs. This deconstruction of The style Art movement continued and flourished with his other contemporary artists; Fx Hash's one-year candle combines de Stijl's work with a new pattern that creates new compositions independent of this work.\n\nUnique collection by ArashMp and Chistai for #fxhashturnsone\nHappy birthday fx(hash)!\n#fxhashturnsone\n\n\n✅ you can save the image in the following sizes:\n⌨️ Key number 1️⃣ 1000✖️1000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number 2️⃣ 2000✖️2000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number 3️⃣ 3000✖️3000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number 4️⃣ 4000✖️4000 pixels\n\n\nLicense: (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) \nmade by p5js\nNovember 2022",
