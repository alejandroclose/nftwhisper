Different species evolve and interact together, resulting in stabilizing patterns out of their parametric configurations. A form of artificial life.\n\nThis work is based on the paper \"Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks\", written by Jeff Jones and popularized in the artistic field by Sage Jenson. Some features were added to increase the visual and behavioral complexity of the system. Agents are divided into different species, with their own set of rules and interacting with their own substrate. Substrates also interact with each other and agents will mutate in contact of some of them.\n\nNFT License\nRuns properly on Chrome 97.0.4692.99\nGPU intensive\n\nPress P to pause (double tab touch devices)\nPress",

            "description": "Illustrations from The Collection of Most Beautiful Fairy Tales I had and puzzles with a painting by Ivan Rabuzin owned by one of my friends are deeply embedded in my childhood memory as images I was enchanted by and wished I knew how to make. Recently, searching for both items in antique stores, it turned out the illustrations, although still beautiful, aren't the same as I remember them. Rabuzin's oeuvre is rich and is a direct inspiration for this project, but I failed to find any evidence those puzzles ever existed and possibly are the product of my imagination. \n\nThe same case is with fairy tales and their true and \"untrue\" nature. A hero embarks on a journey where various events unfold in seemingly random or loosely connected ways. The occurrences sometimes lead to improbable plot twists, but these enigmatic transformations ultimately bring the story full circle, evoking a sense of familiarity combined with an air of mystery.\n\nOn this Enchanted journey, you might end up in one of five possible scenes: Fairy Lake, Magic Wetlands, Giant's Woods, Over 7 Seas and 7 Mountains, or Enchanted Forest. Look out for the FOMO keyboard key to visit more locations.\n\nUse [s] key in live view to save output as PNG. \n\n----\nEnchanted was part of the Blind Gallery x Feral File Vistas Edition.\nLearn more at https://www.blindgallery.xyz/ ",

            "description": "\"Dio\" - our digital interpretation of Sumi-e painting - aims to intertwine the delicate, minimalistic, and nature-focused aesthetics of ancient East Asian art with the precision of modern coding. The concept is inspired by the traditional Sumi-e philosophy that every brush stroke is a defining move. We aimed to introduce a level of intention and directionality to the generative algorithm, much like a human painter's approach to their art.\n\nOur primary source of inspiration is the timeless beauty and simplicity of Sumi-e painting, pioneered by numerous esteemed artists, such as Shozo Sato, Qi Baishi, Xu Wei, Shitao, Katsushika Hokusai, and Sesshū Tōyō. The essential principles of Sumi-e provided us with a unique lens to explore digital generativity in art.\n\nOur process mirrored the chronological nature of a painter's approach - top to bottom, left to right. We started with elemental shapes and iteratively refined them, emulating the Sumi-e single stroke technique. The creation of each element was unique, from mountains to cherry blossoms. Gradually, the algorithm started taking form as an invisible ink painter behind the computer screen, making autonomous artistic decisions.\n\nThe foundation of \"Dio\" is a robust system capable of rendering diverse outputs. We developed a digital infrastructure capable of producing unique brush strokes on the fly, respecting the rules and parameters set for each element. A spectrum of elements, including sun, clouds, peaks, lake, hills, birds, and cherry blossoms, are shuffled to create the final composition. It's a fully coded painting process where the final visual outcome is the pure result of chance, bound only by the rules we implemented.\n\n\"Dio\" (דיו), which means ink in Hebrew, has been our working title throughout the project. The name reflects our roots and pays homage to the traditional Sumi-e painting medium, ink. We believe it captures the essence of our work – a blend of tradition and innovation.\n\nPress \"s\" to save a .png\nPress \"p\" to render Dio at high resulotion.\n\nDio was part of the Blind Gallery x Feral File Vistas Edition.",

            "description": "Optical art, also known as \"Op Art\", is an artistic movement that developed mainly in the 1960s. Its main goal is to create optical illusions and visual effects in works of art to stimulate the viewer's visual perception.\n\nTo make my contribution to this movement what I fused with the wonders of generative art. I have focused on geometric abstraction using simple shapes such as squares, triangles and straight lines to create repetitive patterns organized in such a way as to cause the desired optical effect.\n\nI have used as a base a common pattern of triangles arranged in a specific way recursively. Finally placed within a general square in such a way that the sum of the areas of the triangles is equal to the area of the container.\nAs usual, add the \"half-finished\" drawing effect and a wide variety of color palette.\n\nTo download the image in PNG format press [ s ]\n\nHope you like!\nby RosbelDev",

            "description": "In the creation of \"Asta,\" a tapestry of mathematical precision and mythological grandeur unfolds before the viewer. The name itself is an ode to the Old Norse term \"Ástríðr,\" which combines \"ás,\" or the divine, with \"fríðr,\" the beautiful. Much like the gods and goddesses of Norse mythology, \"Asta\" dwells in a space where disparate forces like unity and fragmentation or chaos and order find harmony.\n\nThe visual core of the artwork is composed of concentric circles meticulously shaped from individual spheres. Each circle, akin to the realms over which Norse gods presided, is a universe unto itself, yet all function as part of an overarching cosmic design. The deities of Norse lore were complex beings, embodying both virtues and flaws, and such dualities reverberate through each sphere and orbit within the piece.\n\nServing as a backdrop for this celestial assembly is a canvas marked by signs of distress and decay. This reflects the concept of entropy inherent in Norse cosmology—often symbolized by the serpent Jormungandr biting its own tail to form a circle. Circles that appear to have lost their center drift aimlessly, reminiscent of gods who have fallen from grace, thereby capturing the unpredictable and imperfect nature of existence.\n\n\"Asta\" is not merely a visual spectacle; it's an invitation to embark on a philosophical exploration. As viewers traverse the delicate balance between intricate patterns and intentional anomalies, they are compelled to confront the eternal dualities symbolized in Norse mythology—such as order and chaos, the finite and the infinite, and the divine and the mortal.\n\nFor those who engage with it, \"Asta\" serves as more than just an art piece. It becomes a poetic meeting with the sublime and a tribute to the complexities that both life and mythology bestow upon the human experience.\n\nControls\n========\nThe controls are as follows:\n- Press `t` - 370 x 200 png output (thumbnail)\n- Press `1` - 650 x 1200 png output\n- Press `2` - 1300 x 2400 png output\n- Press `3` - 1950 x 3600 png output\n- Press `4` - 3250 x 6000 png output\n- Press `5` - 5200 x 9600 png output\n- Press `6` - 7800 x 14400 png output\n\nPlease note that the larger the output, the longer it will take to generate.",

            "description": "In the creation of \"Asta,\" a tapestry of mathematical precision and mythological grandeur unfolds before the viewer. The name itself is an ode to the Old Norse term \"Ástríðr,\" which combines \"ás,\" or the divine, with \"fríðr,\" the beautiful. Much like the gods and goddesses of Norse mythology, \"Asta\" dwells in a space where disparate forces like unity and fragmentation or chaos and order find harmony.\n\nThe visual core of the artwork is composed of concentric circles meticulously shaped from individual spheres. Each circle, akin to the realms over which Norse gods presided, is a universe unto itself, yet all function as part of an overarching cosmic design. The deities of Norse lore were complex beings, embodying both virtues and flaws, and such dualities reverberate through each sphere and orbit within the piece.\n\nServing as a backdrop for this celestial assembly is a canvas marked by signs of distress and decay. This reflects the concept of entropy inherent in Norse cosmology—often symbolized by the serpent Jormungandr biting its own tail to form a circle. Circles that appear to have lost their center drift aimlessly, reminiscent of gods who have fallen from grace, thereby capturing the unpredictable and imperfect nature of existence.\n\n\"Asta\" is not merely a visual spectacle; it's an invitation to embark on a philosophical exploration. As viewers traverse the delicate balance between intricate patterns and intentional anomalies, they are compelled to confront the eternal dualities symbolized in Norse mythology—such as order and chaos, the finite and the infinite, and the divine and the mortal.\n\nFor those who engage with it, \"Asta\" serves as more than just an art piece. It becomes a poetic meeting with the sublime and a tribute to the complexities that both life and mythology bestow upon the human experience.\n\nControls\n========\nThe controls are as follows:\n- Press `t` - 370 x 200 png output (thumbnail)\n- Press `1` - 650 x 1200 png output\n- Press `2` - 1300 x 2400 png output\n- Press `3` - 1950 x 3600 png output\n- Press `4` - 3250 x 6000 png output\n- Press `5` - 5200 x 9600 png output\n- Press `6` - 7800 x 14400 png output\n\nPlease note that the larger the output, the longer it will take to generate.",

            "description": "Optical art, also known as \"Op Art\", is an artistic movement that developed mainly in the 1960s. Its main goal is to create optical illusions and visual effects in works of art to stimulate the viewer's visual perception.\n\nTo make my contribution to this movement what I fused with the wonders of generative art. I have focused on geometric abstraction using simple shapes such as squares, triangles and straight lines to create repetitive patterns organized in such a way as to cause the desired optical effect.\n\nI have used as a base a common pattern of triangles arranged in a specific way recursively. Finally placed within a general square in such a way that the sum of the areas of the triangles is equal to the area of the container.\nAs usual, add the \"half-finished\" drawing effect and a wide variety of color palette.\n\nTo download the image in PNG format press [ s ]\n\nHope you like!\nby RosbelDev",
