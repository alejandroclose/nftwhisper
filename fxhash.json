It is understood that all deployed personnel accessed their barbiturate rations within the following 24 hours.\n\nThe fleet itself remains in position some ~3000kms from The Corium, with plans to relocate the vessels still underway (albeit a low priority).\n\n\nSTATION 733-H OBSERVATION REPORT SUMMARY (14.1.1)\n\nTo date, remote analysis suggests that the body is compositionally similar to corium deposits observed following terrestrial nuclear disasters, consisting of a range of solidified radioactive compounds as well as a number of currently unidentified metal alloys. More in-depth analysis has been impossible to date due to the rapid physical decay of personnel and equipment as their proximity to samples reach a critical threshold.\n\nAll samples have so far been extruded from the surface of The Corium via laser, and maneuvered into orbit around Mars at the edge of it's sphere of influence (at a distance of no less than 50,000kms from Station 733-H), via projectile barrage and gas envelopment.\n\nThe surface of The Corium itself is littered with an array of clearly engineered forms; radial and rectangular patterns, deep crevasses, mazes and grids with only a select few areas resembling the pools of lava observed where Corium has formed terrestrially (it is unclear whether these deposits have formed since the surface was initially engineered).\n\nThe accompanying files are LIDAR renders of the extracted samples in proximity to Station 733-H and are marked for dissemination to terrestrial research teams on Mars.

            "description": "I try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "Ataraxis (or a broken volume renderer) is an exploration in balancing discomfort and calm. The piece generates spaces on the fly that are designed to elicit strange and uncomfortable feelings - like a desolate, alien dreamscape - claustrophobic, surreal, not quite real yet strangely recognisable. But the idea is that while these spaces feel uncomfortable, they're also strangely, antilogically calming. The idea is to elicit a sanguine emotion, to make the viewer feel calm in a strange place, and to lead them somewhere else.\n\nThis work is the culmination of many years of work researching volumetric rendering techniques. This token uses a raymarching technique that is intentionally broken in various ways.\n\nControls:\nDouble-click to download\n&w=X&h=y to change the size of the piece\n&dpr=x to change the resolution of the pice - higher resolutions will result in slightly different artworks as the browser attempts to compensate for the overlarge canvas\n&fullscreen=true to change the token to display the full size of your browser. This may impact the rendering of the token, so use with caution",

            "description": "We cannot compose life, at best we hum along to the melodies that life has been played in front of us. Looking back at the scores of our lives, the notations are never neatly noted, but fully felt.  Rewinding the songs of life are our memories, whether sad, happy, angry, or melancholy. It is not clear whether I am dreaming or awake, but our songs all do end. \n\nIn this final drop (for ?), I have reused the first ever class calligraphy(){} I have written from my genesis drop “Nothing comes from nothing”. As time passes, 10 drops later, across almost to the year, I am grateful for the progress I have made, as an artist, and more importantly as a human. After all, what is behind the code of generative art is a human being. \n\nScores of music, scrolls of calligraphy, calendar or diary, notating life, time passes, and changes are inevitable. Sometimes we sing louder in laughter and joy, sometimes we scribble in uneasiness, sometimes we just get lost in neon lights. Life goes on. You and me, all the same and yet different.  \n\nThere are too many friend artists, friend collectors, fxhash team members, to thank for helping me through this journey. I would like to pay homage to Rudxane in this work, who has taken me under his wings, mentoring and encouraging me in art as well as showing me some degen stuff on the side:-). This homage is not copy-minting, or copying of styles, which I do not have the coding skills to do so even if I wanted to. But it is the influence of taste in many works of Rudxane. In a vague but agreeable taste, I present to you Life has no scores. \n\nWhat I was taught was disrupted, and grid studies left unfinished, and oh do we have a BINGO?\n\nTested on Chrome.
