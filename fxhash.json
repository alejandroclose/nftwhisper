The code tries to replicate not only the style, but also the process and inaccuracies that go into a drawing.\n\nEach iteration has a unique title. \nAll 256 rendered outputs and their respective titles will be displayed in high quality on https://twistie.org/lineage. \n\n10 lucky owners will have their iteration hand drawn and signed. They will each receive the physical 1/1 as well as an NFT version.\n\nPress 's' on keyboard to save in high-res. This is how the art is intended to be viewed.\n\nHardware acceleration on Chromium-based browsers can impact performance!",

            "description": "===== A Simple Fail =====\n\nAn attempt to release a quick follow-up to Adherence following simple rules and a concise set of features has utterly failed!  I ended up spending 9 months of development on this \"quick\" project; I didn't even spend that much time on Adherence.  What happened?  First, and foremost, I had no intention to ever release a project that I wouldn't be absolutely excited about if I were to see in the Incoming feed as a collector.  Nothing wrong with that, right!?  But, not all factors that delayed this project were so noble.  I have to admit that as I continued to stack features and techniques, my codebase, once again, has gotten away from me.  I'm not too worried about how poor my code will look to lurkers (although, God help them!).  But, poor code, without question, hampers the ability for a developer to iterate.  Each shortcut a developer takes lays traps along paths that will eventually be revisited and I took A LOT of shortcuts in my excitement of each new idea.\n\nAppropriately, my failures are fully in keeping with the project itself.  A Simple Fail explores a favorite generative theme of human imperfection through the construction of each mints foundational grid to the \"inaccuracy\" of draw styles that fill each shape.  \n\n<Read more about A Simple Fail:\n@ https://www.bfos.art/projects/a-simple-fail \n@ https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/a-simple-fail>\n\n\n==== fx(params) Info ====\n\nWARNING: 1-Day Grace Period!\n\nThere is only a 24 hour grace period before mint tickets will need to be protected with the params tax.  Why?  Because there is currently no way to trade mint tickets during the grace period.  If you don't mint your ticket immediately, I STRONGLY suggest that you immediately update the price and tax coverage on your mint ticket.  This should only matter in the fortuitous case of a sell out, but I wanted to make sure this was communicated clearly just in case!\n\nI had initially decided to not include params in this project at all.  I think params are great, but most projects released with params so far have suffered because of them, in my opinion.  Params often detract from the artist's efforts to craft the feature-probability space and tuning of the project.  I put a lot of effort into that in this project and I didn't want to see collectors struggle to replicate what I've already crafted.  That said, I loved the restrained way Tyler Boswell (@teaboswell) implemented params in Reunion to give collectors a limited ability to choose their mints.  I thought 25 seeds per wallet was a little on the light side.  So, I have doubled that to 50 potential mints a wallet can choose from.  I have also configured an option to mint a completely random mint in the traditional style.  The features in your mint might include a complementary tip of the hat to your faithfulness for being so bold!  This option is selected by default.\n\n\n===== Interactions =====\n\n{A}dapt to device screen size (twice to rotate, thrice to original)\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{P}erfect grid switch\n{Z}oom switch\n{1-8} Save at x multiple of screen size\n\n== Print Options ==\n{B}ackground switch\n{F}rame switch\n{G}rain switch\n{H}ighlight switch\n\n== URL Parameters (useful for adjusting and saving on mobile devices) ==\n(Start your group of parameters by appending \"&\" to the end of your token URL following the fxparam parameters.

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "\"初夏の旅路 Traveling in Early Summer\"\nis part of the interactive minting experience at Proof of X with KUMALEON, Tokyo, 2023.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nConcept:\n\nAs the rainy days came to an end, the gentle fall of cherry blossoms marked the arrival of early summer. This transitional phase between spring and summer brings a mild and pleasant climate. Nature awakens, showcasing vibrant shades of green as plants thrive and flourish. A stroll through the streets of Tokyo reveals a captivating sight: hydrangeas of various colors grace every corner, casting a spell of natural beauty. While the occasional typhoon may pass by, it does not overshadow the charm of this season. Moreover, the ripening plums offer a taste of traditional Japanese flavors, with options ranging from sour plums to plum wine.\n\nMy inspiration for this piece draws upon my own impressions of early summer in Japan. In 2019, having recently arrived in Japan, I embarked on a journey to Kamakura with my friends. The vivid hydrangeas and serene ponds at Hasedera Temple left an indelible mark on my memory as my first encounter with the essence of early summer in Japan. It was during that year that I delved into the realm of creative coding, by using Processing. The following year, in 2020, I ventured further into generative art using P5.js. Both my pursuit of knowledge in Japan and my creative endeavors became integral parts of my life's journey, akin to cherished scenic spots that leave a lasting impression. Through my artwork, I aspire to share my sentiments from this transformative voyage with the audience.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nNow, let's delve into the details of my creation. The objective of this artwork was to portray a top-down perspective of a pond encircled by lush vegetation, reminiscent of a landscape painting. To imbue the work with different atmospheres, I incorporated four distinct styles for the plant elements: grass, leaves, pine needles, and bubbles. The interplay of these elements breathes life into the still scene, infusing the entire artwork with vitality. The rippling water and gracefully swimming koi in the pond evoke a sense of movement, juxtaposing the serene setting. In Eastern culture, koi symbolizes wealth, auspiciousness, health, and happiness. It bestows good fortune upon those who encounter it. Ultimately, my artwork encapsulates my initial impression of early summer in Japan through a creative approach that intertwines reality and imagination, merging motion and stillness.\n\nThrough this artistic endeavor, I aim to transport the audience to the captivating realm of early summer in Japan. With its vibrant colors, gentle breezes, and the promise of new beginnings, this season captures the essence of natural beauty and the richness of Japanese culture. May my work resonate with viewers, allowing them to embark on their own journey through the enchanting landscapes of their imagination.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nSave as a Picture:\n\nPress “s”or “S” to download a PNG copy of the artwork.\n",

Inspired by the early pioneering work of the concrete poets such as Dom Sylvester Houédard, Ian Hamilton Finley and Steve McCaffe, the project is a play with letters, words and graphic form in the computational and generative space.\n\nEach iteration gives you the possibility to discover a variety of visual form through exploring the system. Please explore your iteration with the key interactions below. It is hoped that you give the time to explore and observe. If you don't, you may end up with just a blank canvas. \n\nThank you for collecting. \n\nKey Interactions\n\n‘a’ activates forward motion on/off\n‘b’ activates backward motion on/off\n‘r’ rotates grid 45° [ rotates on key pressed]\n‘f’ rotates the grid freely [ stops on key release ]\n‘p’ switches grid scale on/off [ this can be CPU heavy on older machines ] \n‘g’ extra glyphs on/off\n‘q’ return to the initial state \n\n\nProgram written by Mark Webster\nFont is copyright ©simonrenaud\n\nareafour.xyz\n@motiondesign_01",

The generative code is derived from Before/After, but adds a unique animation algorithm that causes the artwork to organically expand and contract. The art adapts to different screen sizes but will work best in full-screen mode on a wide-screen monitor.\n\nThe Passing of Time is written in plain JavaScript, with the compute-intensive t-SNE transformation implemented in AssemblyScript and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for maximum performance. No external libraries have been used.\n\n<space bar>: Pause the animation.\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4: Resolution, from lowest (0) to highest (4); default is 2. Try to lower the resolution if the animation isn't smooth.\n\n50% of primary proceeds will be donated to Tezos Ukraine, https://donate.tezos.org.ua/.\n\nAuthor:\nClaus O.

            "description": "\"Slice of Life\" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

            "description": "Returns is an offline-first PWA and an interactive SVG. It combines the joy of interaction, digital color and minimalist sculpture with the potential of a long running, continuously unique visual. Based on “Shipping” from 2016, it is inspired by Anne Truitt, Ugo Rondinone, Imi Knoebel, Kelly Ellsworth and many others.\n\nA subdivision slices the viewport influenced by width, height and depth. Corners are cut by replacing them with two new points, pulled towards each other along the edges. Shapes are “rounded\" by repeating this step, keeping the new points close together. As colors change, so do the relations between shapes, even if geometry changes at a slower pace. New compositions are created on click or after a timeout. This progress over time allows for infinite iterations within the space of each token. It is the promise of a seeded starting point, plus the potential for unlimited new and unique iterations and states over time.",
