            "description": "The \"5-Grid Compression\" project is part of the fxhash and RefractionDAO live minting experience at the Tezos South Beach Miami exhibition on December 6th, 2023.\n\n///\\\\\\///\\\\\\///\n\n\"5-Grid Compression\" is an artistic exploration of self-doubt and self-criticism, reflecting on discarded initial concepts, imperfect prototypes, and unfulfilled aspirations in the realm of art. \nIt features five recursive grids, intentionally \"compressed\" to represent discarded projects as if thrown into a wastebasket. Embracing a raw and unpolished aesthetic, these grids symbolize the often overlooked aspects of the creative process, underscoring the belief that creativity requires time, deep introspection, and persistent exploration. \nThis work emphasizes that every incomplete piece or unrealized idea is valuable, offers insight, and is an essential step in the evolution of digital artistry.\n\n///\\\\\\///\\\\\\///\n\n2023, Created with p5.js and chroma.js",

            "description": "‚ÄúTake Wing‚Äù is a generative art collection depicting the hope, optimism, and thrilling excitement of a person taking off, gaining traction, and soaring to new heights and off into the great unknown.  \n\nThe algorithm behind the piece stems from an attempt to go back to art fundamentals and codify composition rules and painterly techniques into a generative form - taking into account focal points, contrast, eye movement, and color theory while still giving the algorithm freedom to explore random color palettes, random flow field movement, random brush strokes, and many other degrees of freedom.\n\nThe collection is made in pure code with p5.js and a few GLSL fragment shaders.\n\nThe piece has been created to be exhibited at \"In Touch\" with VerticalCryptoArt in Berlin in September 2022, curated by Anika Meier.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo get a (somewhat) high-resolution output, open the live view of your token, and then edit the URL adding &h=5400 at the end of it.  5400 is the tallest you can go, but you can also put a smaller number if you desire.  Be aware that this will only work on a machine with a very beefy GPU, and even then may take a bit, so please be patient!",

Caustic Obstacles uses progressive monte carlo rendering, meaning that at first the image will appear noisy, but over time it will become smoother. It may take up to several minutes for the noise to become unnoticeable (or longer, if you specify a very high resolution). The piece is never officially \"done\" rendering, but instead becomes asymptotically smoother with time - take your screenshots whenever you feel it's smooth enough!\n\nUse the url \"width\" parameter to change the resolution of the piece, e.g. \"/?width=2160\". Every edition is rendered in a 5x7 aspect ratio, and the height will be determined automatically based on the width specified. This means that the height will be determined with the formula width * 7 / 5, rounded up. By default the width is 1080, which results in a height of 1512, while a width of, for example, 2160, would result in a height of 3024.\n\n\n\n‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì\nTENDER x ella\nDecember 2023  \nCaustic Obstacles is a generative art series created by Ella Hoeppner in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì",

            "description": "ASCII-SCAPE\n\nLike for many others growing up during the 1980s & 90s, my very first hands-on encounter with actual computer graphics (outside of games) was in the form of \"textmode\" and its various alphanumeric characters and other symbols available on the 8bit home computers of that period. These machines were perfectly capable of producing fairly high-resolution & multi-color graphics (all relative), yet most systems booted into an interactive prompt with the so-called textmode as de-facto standard environment, providing a level, if also limited, playing field for the creation of text-based graphics from a patchwork of characters & symbols of a predefined font (system or custom). As is so often the case, limitation is the mother of invention and the regular, monospaced grid and standardized set of characters quickly encouraged an entire subculture of specialized designers & artists to emerge (which is currently being re-discovered & remixed by younger generations), applying & showcasing their creativity (with often surprisingly ingenious skills) in the form of game designs, user interfaces, disk mags, demoscene productions, competitions, flyers, BBSes and even various early Web designs of the mid/late 90s.\n\nASCII-SCAPE is an attempted non-nostalgic homage to these roots & culture. It is also a textmode-only (no canvas!) rework of my previous piece C-SCAPE. It combines my love of cellular automata with the stripped back aesthetics & limitations of using only text as representation medium of these co-evolving generative systems. It required an almost complete rewrite & re-curation of various elements: 1200+ new handpicked rule combinations, 32 character sets, 40 color themes, new relationships & biases to better manage the resulting textures, densities and contrast.\n\nAlthough technically not strictly \"ASCII\" (an actual standard, but also a popular shorthand for \"text only\"), the entire simulation only uses various Unicode characters and the beautiful Iosevka open source typeface by Renzhi Li aka Belleve Invis.\n\nLike its parent C-SCAPE, this project is dynamic and evolves indefinitely. It's best viewed on non-mobile devices, where there's a decent horizontal resolution to provide sufficient simulation space. Please see the C-SCAPE project description for further details. There's no graphical export feature, but output can be captured into an UTF-8 plain text file (max. 100k lines/generations).\n\nThe following keyboard shortcuts are available:\n\n- space : toggle simulation updates (pause/play)\n- r : randomize environment\n- x : start/stop recording\n- f : toggle scroll speed (fast/slow)\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nIosevka typeface licensed under OFL-1.1 license\n\nhttps://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and https://thi.ng",

Be aware that this will only work on a machine with a very beefy GPU, and even then may take a bit, so please be patient!",
