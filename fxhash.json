            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works ‚Äì focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other‚Äôs work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them ‚Äì especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra‚Äôs use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work ‚Äì especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra‚Äôs compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me ‚ÄúMe as you ‚Äù (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor ‚ÄúMe as you as me‚Äù I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach‚Äôs work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, ‚ÄúMe as Me‚Äù has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh ‚Äìis it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave ‚Äì is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  ‚Äì\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes ‚Äì\nPress ‚Äúh‚Äù to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press ‚Äúm‚Äù to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and ‚Äúl‚Äù to reduce it. Use ‚Äús‚Äù to save the current resolution. \n\n",

This one has a consistent gap between flow lines and a low noise resolution, producing a wispy effect that often looks like thread or felt.  Sometimes the background is a bit garish, which can be fun.  There's a good chance some texture will be added in the end, either mixing the colors and softening, or adding a fine paper texture.  It finishes off with a grain shader by Dave Pegurek found here: https://editor.p5js.org/davepagurek/sketches/m6p09ERHx\n\nAfter opening, hit 2 - 5 for higher pixel densities, and 's' to save a png. Resizing the canvas reverts to pixel density 1.\n\nCome visit my YouTube channel for generative art how-to videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjYUJudUW67Tg79jtF_rpQ",

            "description": "Toccata is a piece about decay, about the impermanent. The emergence over time or, rather, progression of entropy is a key characteristic of our universe. Everything evolves to nothing. We as mortal beings have sometimes trouble reconciling with this idea. Humans have sought immortality for millennia, be it through ancient potions or modern medicine, be it from leaving a legacy that we feel will stand the test of time. It will, only to decay later than us.\n\nToccata is a piece about change. Change lies at the heart of human cognition and human nature. Our thoughts and our emotions happen over time, and are a function of the change that is both around us and at the very core of our selves. Change comes in nature in cycles. Seasons of growth, seasons of ripe fruits of life, seasons of decay, of death, rebirth.\n\nToccata is music. We find music to convey some of the deepest streams of human condition, connecting it to some other form of being. Music also happens over time, and music happens because of change. Music encodes our feelings better than any other aid we may have. Toccata incorporates this at its very core, as the main sound is Andreas' family piano where he learned to play, sampled this past July.\n\nRead more about the piece, and the collaboration between Marcelo and Andreas on andreasrau.eu/toccata\n\n---\n\nBasic controls:\n- Click on the piece or press spacebar to start it (WebAudio requires user intervention for the music to start). Once the music has started, again click or press spacebar to play/pause.\n- Press ‚Äús‚Äù to save a still at the current resolution\n- Press ‚Äúr‚Äù to start recording a video at the current resolution, then ‚Äúr‚Äù again to stop.\n\n---\n\nWebM audio-video recording performed using the library RecordRTC by https://muazkhan.com/, MIT licence.",

The sunsets in coastal California are a perfect compliment to these hills, and I set out to represent that combination in this work.\n\nEach iteration of this algorithm feels, to me, like a glimpse out of a car window on a drive up the coast, a pause on a cool morning hike, or a memory of tearing through sharp underbrush with good company.\n\nStylistically and texturally, I drew from landscapes rendered in oil pastels, placing thousands of tiny circles, alluding to the effect of depositing particles of color onto paper. \n\nI hope that this work evokes in the viewer the feelings of peace, wildness, and adventure that I feel when I watch the sun set over these hills.\n\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\nNotes:\n- Append ‚Äú&mag=N‚Äù to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.",

            "description": "In Flow is the first in a series of four projects exploring flow fields, produced with 100% code in p5.js.  This one has a consistent gap between flow lines and a low noise resolution, producing a wispy effect that often looks like thread or felt.  Sometimes the background is a bit garish, which can be fun.  There's a good chance some texture will be added in the end, either mixing the colors and softening, or adding a fine paper texture.  It finishes off with a grain shader by Dave Pegurek found here: https://editor.p5js.org/davepagurek/sketches/m6p09ERHx\n\nAfter opening, hit 2 - 5 for higher pixel densities, and 's' to save a png. Resizing the canvas reverts to pixel density 1.\n\nCome visit my YouTube channel for generative art how-to videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjYUJudUW67Tg79jtF_rpQ",

            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‚ÄòEverything‚Äô explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we‚Äôre never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things ‚Äì that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that‚Äôs made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors ‚Äì or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let‚Äôs flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical ‚Äì microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos ‚Äì an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): ‚Äú&fullscreen=2‚Äù\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: ‚Äú&width=5000‚Äù\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the ‚ÄúF‚Äù command for best results. ",
