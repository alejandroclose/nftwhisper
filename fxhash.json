It may take several seconds to produce a recognizable image, and several minutes to produce a high-quality render with no visible noise.\n\nCreated with webgl and clojurescript.\n\nControls:\n\nClick on the canvas to open a menu in the top right corner. In this menu you will see controls to capture a screenshot, adjust resolution, and adjust the camera, along with several other controls.\n\nWhen the \"optimized render\" option is checked, the page will compute an acceleration structure before rendering to allow the piece to converge much faster. With this option checked, the piece may need to process for up to a minute before rendering begins, but subsequently the rendering will proceed much more quickly than normal. This can be used to generate high-quality captures more quickly than when the option is not checked.\n\nWhen the \"filtering\" option is checked, a noise filter will be applied to the result of the render, reducing the appearance of noise.\n\nThe \"logic multiple\" slider can be used to multiply the amount of rendering work done each frame. Increasing this number may allow the piece to render more quickly, but may also make the page laggy. It is not recommended to increase this number unless you have a powerful GPU.",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "WHISPERS (in code) is part of the fx(hash) interactive minting experience at Performance in Code: Deciphering Value in Generative Art, Art Basel Miami Beach, 2022. \nThe project is a collaborative performance between the viewer and AI. It reverses the usual approach of using AI as a tool to perform our intents (as in popular prompt-based AI methods) and gives the decision-making power to the AI, where we, humans, receive instructions on how to proceed in the creative process. Interaction happens in a multi-stage manner, in a metaphor for the process of training neural networks. At each step, after the user performs the action, they can send the image for evaluation by the neural network and receive another instruction (similarly to how networks learn by receiving feedback from the loss function).  What makes us different from the machines, however, is the presence of free will, and our ability to disobey the machine’s guidance. We are not restricted to its instructions and are free to interact with and break the artwork. \n\nArtwork is built on layers of photography, AI, GAN, diffusion, classification convolutional networks, random pixel manipulations, and user interaction. Like with most artist projects, it starts with a few memories, that are then re-imagined by GAN. The initial building blocks are a combination of photographs and AI outputs. The apparent lack of coherent subject choice in input images signifies how we build the perception of the world around us and apply an individual hierarchy to elements worth remembering. The blocks are then stripped of meaning by reducing them to abstract shapes and applying stochastic image transformations, guided by randomness. The neural network then learns to classify the images and outputs its best guesses on how to improve the pictures. \n \nThe goal of the project is to explore the controversial question of authorship through the use of tools incorporating AI. Does it lie with decisive or executive power? Here, the boundaries are blurred and one can no longer distinguish the clear author of a finished artwork - is it the artist, AI, serendipity, or viewer? \n\n\n- Use your mouse to perform machine instructions.\n- Use the \"E\" key to ask the neural network for instructions.\n- Use the \"R\" key to reset the drawing.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.\n",

How will they be arranged, \nand what will they sound like\nwhen they arrive at their destination?\nWhat will they be doing?\nWhat will the world be doing?\nWill the words be quiet or loud?\nWill they be full of themselves,\nor full of longing,\nor full of longing’s opposite?”\n \nAn ars poetica on the future of literature and humanity. \n \nThis project is a one-time generative poetry performance of a transhuman text by Sasha Stiles and her AI alter ego, Technelegy – read and unread by an algorithm authored by Nathaniel Stern. Every hash transforms one of 353 lines of AI-written poetry from legible letters into wordless language, generating a unique textblock from millions of possible combinations; each algorithmic translation unwrites itself, forever. Press \"s\" to overlay and toggle the original line of verse, and watch its shapes and meanings degenerate – or evolve – into an infinite visual poem.\n \nAll minters will receive an airdropped broadside (mp4) of the entire original poem after the performance is complete. A 1/1 media-rich audiovisual version of THE WORD AFTER US will also be made available.\n\n \nPoetic traits:\n- 353 possible lines of generative poetry produced by a GPT-3 language model fine-tuned on Stiles’ and Stern’s writing and research.\n- 28 possible color palette combinations selected from Stern’s performative scanner art, with rare palettes including RGB, Hacker, Charcoal, and Chalkboard (black background).\n- 6 possible fonts, including the premiere of Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer.”\n- millions of layout and layering possibilities, including a rare “spiral” effect.\n- billions of animation attribute combinations, which carry on forever.",

This can be toggled off by adding “&b=0” to the url.\nThe background scales with resolution to mimic a bigger canvas so it will look different at different resolutions.\nAt high resolutions a Moiré pattern may appear on the canvas background texture due to the way images are resized in the browser.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "It may appear as an indecipherable map to some. To others, it may present itself as a cross section of an underground cave. Or maybe an uncanny landscape of volcanic activity, a diagram of geological strata, or even something else entirely. Some vague structure may also appear; is it the remains of an ancient civilization? Or perhaps a glimpse into our own tomorrow?\n\nIn \"Agharta\", I sought to create a generative work that could invite the viewer to explore the depths of their imagination and uncover hidden structures within the seemingly chaotic composition. The idea came to me when I was exploring Simplex noise and pixel displacement in Cables. I was surprised by the emergent structures that appeared when some set of parameters paired with the right texture. \n\nThe title of the piece references the mythical underground world said to be located at the earth's core. This idea of hidden depths and secret worlds within the earth resonates with the abstract and enigmatic nature of the result generated by the noise. Imagery of landscape, vague structures, or geological features may appear but never stand out on its own; it exists in a state of constant flow and intersection as if viewed from another dimension. And just like the myth itself that bring up numerous theories that doesn’t necessarily connected to each other, it hints at that idea of an elusive imagined realm while never actually represent it completely.\n\n\n\n=========\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024px (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048px\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840px\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[Scroll/pinch] to zoom and drag to pan\n\n[r] or [zoom out to max] Reset position\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot of the current state at rendered resolution\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* This project use shaders that relies on GPU. Hi-res output may slow down your device. Since it also utilize GPU instance for thumbnail rendering, expect longer time for every iterations to be signed by fx(hash).\n\n* If 'glitching' occurs or the composition behaves differently at different resolution, just refresh the page to reset it (except for the thin lines, which are always drawn at approximately 1 pixel, so expect it to vary at different resolution).\n\nMade with cables.gl, a node-based webgl environment\n\nXALTED 2022",

Perfect for yourself or as gifts for people you love. \n\nDesigned to be printed or plotted and then cut out and hung on your tree or any other place that needs a little festive cheer. \n\nI’ll be picking a few of my favorite outputs and sending the token owners special limited edition signed laser cut versions of their ornaments. \n\n———————\n\nLIVE MODE FEATURES\n- L prepares it for plotting or cutting\n- S exports a layered SVG\n- P exports a PNG\n- 1-9 plays with color combos\n\n———————\n\nFor years my family has collected Wallace Silver Candy Cane ornaments. Each Christmas the kids open up that years design and add it to the tree. With my daughters mostly grown, we now have quite the collection of dozens of ornaments from all the years. Each one full with memories and emotions. \n\nThis series is inspired by that tradition, starting with 2022, and continuing with a new release each year. I hope you enjoy this series and it brings much delight and joy to you, your family, and friends this holiday season. ",
