            "description": "'Memories: Train Station' explores plottable abstract photography composition around the \"Train Station\" theme. Memories can be blurry, faded and abstract and the strokes texturing aim to reflect that.\n\nMany images are used as primitive to make the plot texture. The work is very generative and have great range of variety thanks to the many effects combined together. Photos has been taken by @greweb in Paris' \"Gare de l'Est\" train station.\n\nTraits of the art includes a suggested \"Title\" that is self-generated.\n\nPLOTTABLE?!\n\nA SVG file can be exported (right click save) to plot the piece physically. The plot is made of up to 200 000 points – making it time consuming to produce. It is recommended to optimize the pen travel. Inks can have surprising outcomes when done physically.\n\nThe digital NFT is the recipe to a plottable art piece, owning it confers the right to plot or request a physical plot from @greweb (https://greweb.me/plots/nft). @greweb would use fountain pens but other plotting artists are free to achieve it with their own materials and ship to collectors – as long as NFT is owned at request time.\n\nMore details and Source code: https://github.com/gre/gre/tree/master/doodles/plottable-memories-train-station\n\n@greweb – 2022 – tech: WebGL + Rust + WASM – CC BY-SA 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/",

A curated 5 colors palette is picked and used for the textures. The colors are first sorted by saturation to select a reference color. With this, the colors are then sorted again by luminance.\n\nThe animation itself is 32 frames long and stops abruptly. It consists of 3 layers. The first layer moves the objects around the center and draws the animated objects. The second uses the first layer and a double buffer to capture the motion blur based on a depth mask. The third is mainly for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- shapes [7] (toruses, cubes, planes, toruses & cubes, toruses & planes, cubes & planes, toruses, cubes & planes)\n- palette [58] (based on German Max Magazine covers 1991 - 1995)\n- color sort direction [2] (up, down) - sort by saturation\n- color sort reference [3] (0, 1, 2) - used for sorting by luminance / background color\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 32 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar to trigger a spinning animation (or single click / tap)\n- `o` to trigger random object change animation followed by a rotation animation (or double click / tap)\n- `r` to trigger a random feature change followed by a random object change and rotation animation (or triple click / tap)\n- `k` to toggle this kiosk mode (off, 3, 5 or 10 secs)\n- `c` to capture an image\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- size=8000 - sets the base size for width/height to 8000px (default 3000, useful if you want to capture bigger pngs)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=5 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "Roll the dice with shapes and capture the moment!\nAlea, by the way, is Latin and means dice / gambling.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach Alea consists of 64 objects randomly arranged around a center and randomly differing in shape, texture, and movement. A curated 5 colors palette is picked and used for the textures. The colors are first sorted by saturation to select a reference color. With this, the colors are then sorted again by luminance.\n\nThe animation itself is 32 frames long and stops abruptly. It consists of 3 layers. The first layer moves the objects around the center and draws the animated objects. The second uses the first layer and a double buffer to capture the motion blur based on a depth mask. The third is mainly for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- shapes [7] (toruses, cubes, planes, toruses & cubes, toruses & planes, cubes & planes, toruses, cubes & planes)\n- palette [58] (based on German Max Magazine covers 1991 - 1995)\n- color sort direction [2] (up, down) - sort by saturation\n- color sort reference [3] (0, 1, 2) - used for sorting by luminance / background color\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 32 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar to trigger a spinning animation (or single click / tap)\n- `o` to trigger random object change animation followed by a rotation animation (or double click / tap)\n- `r` to trigger a random feature change followed by a random object change and rotation animation (or triple click / tap)\n- `k` to toggle this kiosk mode (off, 3, 5 or 10 secs)\n- `c` to capture an image\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- size=8000 - sets the base size for width/height to 8000px (default 3000, useful if you want to capture bigger pngs)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=5 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

A curated 5 colors palette is picked and used for the textures. The colors are first sorted by saturation to select a reference color. With this, the colors are then sorted again by luminance.\n\nThe animation itself is 32 frames long and stops abruptly. It consists of 3 layers. The first layer moves the objects around the center and draws the animated objects. The second uses the first layer and a double buffer to capture the motion blur based on a depth mask. The third is mainly for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- shapes [7] (toruses, cubes, planes, toruses & cubes, toruses & planes, cubes & planes, toruses, cubes & planes)\n- palette [58] (based on German Max Magazine covers 1991 - 1995)\n- color sort direction [2] (up, down) - sort by saturation\n- color sort reference [3] (0, 1, 2) - used for sorting by luminance / background color\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 32 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar to trigger a spinning animation (or single click / tap)\n- `o` to trigger random object change animation followed by a rotation animation (or double click / tap)\n- `r` to trigger a random feature change followed by a random object change and rotation animation (or triple click / tap)\n- `k` to toggle this kiosk mode (off, 3, 5 or 10 secs)\n- `c` to capture an image\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- size=8000 - sets the base size for width/height to 8000px (default 3000, useful if you want to capture bigger pngs)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=5 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

            "description": "*\\_../*`¬-’\\/*`¬’’¬`*\\/’-¬`*\\.._/*\n\nNature, nature, evolving might… Silent inventor, always right.\nWhere is the edge of nature and where do we begin?  \nWhat is of nature and what is of man? \nIsn't everything made by nature's hands?\n\nTo know more about the concept and technicalities of this piece, see the fxtext article “The spectrum of nature - a short making of”. Link at the bottom. If you’d rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

            "description": "Roll the dice with shapes and capture the moment!\nAlea, by the way, is Latin and means dice / gambling.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach Alea consists of 64 objects randomly arranged around a center and randomly differing in shape, texture, and movement. A curated 5 colors palette is picked and used for the textures. The colors are first sorted by saturation to select a reference color. With this, the colors are then sorted again by luminance.\n\nThe animation itself is 32 frames long and stops abruptly. It consists of 3 layers. The first layer moves the objects around the center and draws the animated objects. The second uses the first layer and a double buffer to capture the motion blur based on a depth mask. The third is mainly for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- shapes [7] (toruses, cubes, planes, toruses & cubes, toruses & planes, cubes & planes, toruses, cubes & planes)\n- palette [58] (based on German Max Magazine covers 1991 - 1995)\n- color sort direction [2] (up, down) - sort by saturation\n- color sort reference [3] (0, 1, 2) - used for sorting by luminance / background color\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 32 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar to trigger a spinning animation (or single click / tap)\n- `o` to trigger random object change animation followed by a rotation animation (or double click / tap)\n- `r` to trigger a random feature change followed by a random object change and rotation animation (or triple click / tap)\n- `k` to toggle this kiosk mode (off, 3, 5 or 10 secs)\n- `c` to capture an image\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- size=8000 - sets the base size for width/height to 8000px (default 3000, useful if you want to capture bigger pngs)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=5 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",
