            "description": "This idea was born from recent discussion on generative art and the path the medium is finding for itself. The project aims to take aesthetic concepts from sci fi graphic novels and blend them with generative systems of abstraction. \n\nThe debate is between using previously established art forms to influence this new medium, or using a new medium to meticulously reproduce a previous medium. I believe there’s room to explore the full spectrum, and I am attempting to find the midpoint that fits my work and brings me the most happiness.\n\nThe title describes the eventual aesthetic objective, which is to create a piece which might look like a splash page a colorist alone has been given the freedom to design and explore their own specialty. It explores centralized polar compositions, vibrant colors, plus lots and lots of movement. 60# paper is a standard weight for printing of comic books and graphic novels.\n\nPress ’s’ in live view to save a .png\n\nCreated with p5.js and chroma.js\n",

            "description": "The Corium is a roughly spherical mass (diameter ~1km), of currently unknown origins situated within the core region of the solar system's asteroid belt.\nThe body was discovered during a uranium extraction mission undertaken by ET Resources at the behest of Station 733-H (Mars colony) leadership, when ionising radiation levels detected by deployed surface craft exceeded equipment and personnel tolerance levels by many orders of magnitude.\n\nWhile ETR crew were quick to respond to local abort orders (27 minutes from initial readings to fleet reorientation); Station 733-H made the determination that radiation exposure levels were already far in excess of anything that could be reasonably mitigated upon the ETR fleet's return.\nThe ETR fleet was ordered to jettison fuel reserves under Section 9 of the Space Corporations Act (Mars) approximately 90 minutes after the readings were initially reported. It is understood that all deployed personnel accessed their barbiturate rations within the following 24 hours.\n\nThe fleet itself remains in position some ~3000kms from The Corium, with plans to relocate the vessels still underway (albeit a low priority).\n\n\nSTATION 733-H OBSERVATION REPORT SUMMARY (14.1.1)\n\nTo date, remote analysis suggests that the body is compositionally similar to corium deposits observed following terrestrial nuclear disasters, consisting of a range of solidified radioactive compounds as well as a number of currently unidentified metal alloys. More in-depth analysis has been impossible to date due to the rapid physical decay of personnel and equipment as their proximity to samples reach a critical threshold.\n\nAll samples have so far been extruded from the surface of The Corium via laser, and maneuvered into orbit around Mars at the edge of it's sphere of influence (at a distance of no less than 50,000kms from Station 733-H), via projectile barrage and gas envelopment.\n\nThe surface of The Corium itself is littered with an array of clearly engineered forms; radial and rectangular patterns, deep crevasses, mazes and grids with only a select few areas resembling the pools of lava observed where Corium has formed terrestrially (it is unclear whether these deposits have formed since the surface was initially engineered).\n\nThe accompanying files are LIDAR renders of the extracted samples in proximity to Station 733-H and are marked for dissemination to terrestrial research teams on Mars. Study of The Corium remains the sole priority of Station 733-H research personnel, as any risks presented to the solar system or its inhabitants are currently not well understood.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe piece will render from the top right and might take ~5-10 seconds to begin.\n\nAppend \"&print=true\" to the live render URL for a hi-res output.",

            "description": "This project is a playful attempt to depict how Neo-plasticism painters abstracted compositions, inspired and a tribute to the \"De Stijl\" movement, drawn using statically rendered block elements. The visual language reminds the original designs of famous artists of this art movement; in this project, each color palette is categorized by the name of a favorite piece of these artists. These palettes are sometimes determined by the color combination of this artist's works, which form the visual identity of their works from the color dimension.\nIn this project, different nodes are simple orthogonal shapes of color spots and thin lines to demarcate colors. I tried to create a dynamic effect by questioning the usual signs of vision in the abstract works of this period, to modify the relationship between them profoundly, and to show another field of my understanding of this movement by drawing a personal space.\nThe colors red, black, blue, and yellow were used from this turning point in the Neo-plasticism that the artists of the 'De Stijl movement cared about.\nSubtle black lines separate the vast rectangles, which for some are filled with bright or black, or gray; each small component is a member to create a whole and a single visualization, and each aspect of the components receives its visual value from the whole.\nThis work has set 27 color palettes and three variations to shape different rarities. It is better to set the browser to standard mode to see the effect better.\n\nDe Stijl\n \nThe style \"De Stijl\" of the Dutch avant-garde movement is an essential key to understanding the sources of the modern movement. The movement is organized around three central figures: the painter Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg and the furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld. Other core members are the painters Bart van der Leck, Georges Vantongerlo, and Willmus Huzar; the architects J.J.P Oud, Robert van Hoff, and Jan Wills; the poet Anthony Cook, later the graphic designer Piet Zwart and the architect Cornelis van Stern.\nIn 1918, a year after the official founding of the group and publication of the magazine's first issue that published and publicized the movement's doctrine, the creators of De Stijl combined the aesthetic and social vision. The group's first manifesto calls for a new balance between the individual and the universal and fights to free art from the limitations of the cult of individualism. \n \nDe Stijl originates both in the Hegelian tradition and in the Theosophical movement, then spreading in the Netherlands, both a utopian vision and a commitment to the production of the reality of the industrial world. However, it is a formal, plastic, pictorial, or architectural transcription of the principles of universal harmony that its creators implement. Painting, sculpture, furniture design, graphic design, architecture, and soon urban planning support this experiment, carried out simultaneously by different group creators. De Style productions naturally go beyond the traditional and academic division between primary and secondary arts, decorative arts, architecture, and urban planning.\nFrom the realm of the mind to the city, this can be the guiding thread for the evolution of the Style's productions during its fourteen years of life. The spatial nature of the work of art gradually reaches from the status of supporting the analysis of the world to a factor in building the social and political environment of the city. In this way, the spatialization of the work forms an experience of the world, gives order to the world, and gives essence to society. \nThe Style's priority is to invent an official language that responds to the challenges of the industrial society after World War I and outlines strategies for implementing the new social order.\nThe method of this vision is Neo-plasticism, which initially consists in radicalizing the approach of the contemporary avant-gardes.",

While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "This project is a playful attempt to depict how Neo-plasticism painters abstracted compositions, inspired and a tribute to the \"De Stijl\" movement, drawn using statically rendered block elements. The visual language reminds the original designs of famous artists of this art movement; in this project, each color palette is categorized by the name of a favorite piece of these artists. These palettes are sometimes determined by the color combination of this artist's works, which form the visual identity of their works from the color dimension.\nIn this project, different nodes are simple orthogonal shapes of color spots and thin lines to demarcate colors. I tried to create a dynamic effect by questioning the usual signs of vision in the abstract works of this period, to modify the relationship between them profoundly, and to show another field of my understanding of this movement by drawing a personal space.\nThe colors red, black, blue, and yellow were used from this turning point in the Neo-plasticism that the artists of the 'De Stijl movement cared about.\nSubtle black lines separate the vast rectangles, which for some are filled with bright or black, or gray; each small component is a member to create a whole and a single visualization, and each aspect of the components receives its visual value from the whole.\nThis work has set 27 color palettes and three variations to shape different rarities. It is better to set the browser to standard mode to see the effect better.\n\nDe Stijl\n \nThe style \"De Stijl\" of the Dutch avant-garde movement is an essential key to understanding the sources of the modern movement. The movement is organized around three central figures: the painter Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg and the furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld. Other core members are the painters Bart van der Leck, Georges Vantongerlo, and Willmus Huzar; the architects J.J.P Oud, Robert van Hoff, and Jan Wills; the poet Anthony Cook, later the graphic designer Piet Zwart and the architect Cornelis van Stern.\nIn 1918, a year after the official founding of the group and publication of the magazine's first issue that published and publicized the movement's doctrine, the creators of De Stijl combined the aesthetic and social vision. The group's first manifesto calls for a new balance between the individual and the universal and fights to free art from the limitations of the cult of individualism. \n \nDe Stijl originates both in the Hegelian tradition and in the Theosophical movement, then spreading in the Netherlands, both a utopian vision and a commitment to the production of the reality of the industrial world. However, it is a formal, plastic, pictorial, or architectural transcription of the principles of universal harmony that its creators implement. Painting, sculpture, furniture design, graphic design, architecture, and soon urban planning support this experiment, carried out simultaneously by different group creators. De Style productions naturally go beyond the traditional and academic division between primary and secondary arts, decorative arts, architecture, and urban planning.\nFrom the realm of the mind to the city, this can be the guiding thread for the evolution of the Style's productions during its fourteen years of life. The spatial nature of the work of art gradually reaches from the status of supporting the analysis of the world to a factor in building the social and political environment of the city. In this way, the spatialization of the work forms an experience of the world, gives order to the world, and gives essence to society. \nThe Style's priority is to invent an official language that responds to the challenges of the industrial society after World War I and outlines strategies for implementing the new social order.\nThe method of this vision is Neo-plasticism, which initially consists in radicalizing the approach of the contemporary avant-gardes.",
