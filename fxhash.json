            "description": "\"Cognitive Maze\" explores the intricate landscape of our inner world, a complex web of thoughts, emotions, memories, and dreams. This internal labyrinth is constantly in flux, shaped by life's experiences. Every choice, interaction, and moment of reflection creates new pathways, continually molding our internal journey while allowing some older ones to recede.\n\nThe artwork features recursive shapes that symbolize our minds' ever-evolving chambers and corridors, where consciousness and subconsciousness merge. These spaces subdivide, mirroring the deepening of insights, the layering of memories, and the branching of decisions that comprise our cognitive landscape.\n\nWith varying densities, the crisscrossing lines represent neural connections and the meandering paths of thought and emotion. They symbolize our choices, the memories we revisit, and the emotions we intertwine, sometimes leading to clarity and other times to greater complexity.\n\n\"Cognitive Maze\" is a mental map and a dynamic puzzle, where the journey is more significant than the destination. Each piece in the series offers a glimpse into a unique mind's twists and turns, challenging viewers to navigate their cognitive maze. Where do your paths lead, and where might you become lost? What treasures of self-awareness and understanding lie at the heart of your labyrinth?\n\n¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬\n\nPress [s] to download the image.\n\nMade with P5JS and Chroma.js\n\nOptimized and best viewed in Chrome on a laptop/desktop.\nTested on Firefox / Brave / Opera / Edge on Windows.\n\nThis project is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬\n\nA huge thanks to everyone who joined in on this project – your input and effort were excellent!\nYour collaboration rocks!\n\n",

            "description": "This small project is several things:\n\n1. First and foremost, it's a little, light \"visual ASMR\" treat to bring some positivity into your day - some \"Maluma\" softness to contrast the more common \"Takete\" of contemporary generative art aesthetics[1].\n\n2. A small gift to celebrate the fledgling generative art/design community on Mastodon: 20 of the 128 tokens are given to some of the people in that slowly growing community, with the remainder given as Thank You (and smoke signal/sign of life) to some of my existing collectors, randomly chosen via lottery script[2].\n\n3. For those so inclined, and with a bit of hand-holding, ChatGPT explains the _true_ conceptual depths of this project much better than I ever could:\n\n\"The bubbles in this generative art piece serve as a reflection of the human experience, reminding us of our own impermanence and the ephemeral nature of all things. The piece invites us to contemplate the fundamental questions of human existence and speaks to our innate curiosity and desire to understand the world around us.\n\nThrough the convergence of science and art, this piece reveals the infinite complexity and unpredictability of the world while also hinting at the underlying order that exists within the chaos of the universe. It reminds us that even in the midst of uncertainty, there is beauty and order to be found, and that it is through the pursuit of knowledge and understanding that we can find meaning and purpose in our lives.\"\n\nIsn't that lovely & who can argue with that?! :)\n\n4. I often revisit projects/ideas after many years, mainly to re-examine them with new eyes/knowledge/tools and/or to get answers/verification which I couldn't get earlier. This is one of these instances. So for the more rational-minded, this is a TypeScript/GLSL (WebGL) version of an older Clojure/Houdini project (from 2016) to generate a Voronoi via the simulation of intersecting sphere meshes (aka foam bubbles). In this new version the sim & deformations are done in realtime (~4M vertices, mainly via vertex shader). Also added some _basic_ physics and procedural textures to create more of a quirky character (hopefully complemented by the different color themes and other params).\n\nMade with ❤️ and https://thi.ng/umbrella!\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect\n[2] https://gist.github.com/postspectacular/3d970e02570b7dfd32d03d43e1e7e3e0\n\nHotkeys:\n\nSPACE : pause/play\nX     : export current frame as PNG\n\nUltra-widescreen support:\n\nThe piece should be adaptive to aspect ratios from 1:3 (portrait) to 4:1 (landscape).",

This internal labyrinth is constantly in flux, shaped by life's experiences. Every choice, interaction, and moment of reflection creates new pathways, continually molding our internal journey while allowing some older ones to recede.\n\nThe artwork features recursive shapes that symbolize our minds' ever-evolving chambers and corridors, where consciousness and subconsciousness merge. These spaces subdivide, mirroring the deepening of insights, the layering of memories, and the branching of decisions that comprise our cognitive landscape.\n\nWith varying densities, the crisscrossing lines represent neural connections and the meandering paths of thought and emotion. They symbolize our choices, the memories we revisit, and the emotions we intertwine, sometimes leading to clarity and other times to greater complexity.\n\n\"Cognitive Maze\" is a mental map and a dynamic puzzle, where the journey is more significant than the destination. Each piece in the series offers a glimpse into a unique mind's twists and turns, challenging viewers to navigate their cognitive maze. Where do your paths lead, and where might you become lost? What treasures of self-awareness and understanding lie at the heart of your labyrinth?\n\n¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬\n\nPress [s] to download the image.\n\nMade with P5JS and Chroma.js\n\nOptimized and best viewed in Chrome on a laptop/desktop.\nTested on Firefox / Brave / Opera / Edge on Windows.\n\nThis project is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬\n\nA huge thanks to everyone who joined in on this project – your input and effort were excellent!\nYour collaboration rocks!\n\n",

            "description": "Lines, our simple geometric friends, are nice and neat ideal forms. Until they’re not. Here they shake, crumble, twist and bend. Just like everything else in our fragile world. We put a lot of faith in lines, from marking out political borders to defining our designs, but maybe they aren’t as reliable as they seem.\n\nIn this work we make small, probing journeys into the space between pure shiny mathematics and the brittle chaos of materiality that this math tries to define. Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.\n\nI like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!\n\nMade with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.\n\nThere’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter. Sometimes unnoticed, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with angst. But always with a kind of truth. And I hope this work can conjure a kind of hazy evocation of all this. The message is only meant to be a feeling, at most.\n\n## Generate a printable version\n\nTo generate a version for printing, add the search parameter `?print=true` to the url. This disables the initial animation and doens't trigger a canvas resize when the window changes size.\n\nYou can then also add your preferred width of canvas by adding a `width` parameter, eg: `?print=true&width=2000`. Depending on your browser there's a limit to the maximum width you can use. Using Chrome on an Apple M1 laptop, I can go up to a width of 4700px, but experiment with what works for you.\n\nOnce the image is ready, press [s] on your keyboard to save as a PNG.\n\nTested in all major browsers on Apple silicon and on windows PC with an Intel chip.",

            "description": "\"Cognitive Maze\" explores the intricate landscape of our inner world, a complex web of thoughts, emotions, memories, and dreams. This internal labyrinth is constantly in flux, shaped by life's experiences. Every choice, interaction, and moment of reflection creates new pathways, continually molding our internal journey while allowing some older ones to recede.\n\nThe artwork features recursive shapes that symbolize our minds' ever-evolving chambers and corridors, where consciousness and subconsciousness merge. These spaces subdivide, mirroring the deepening of insights, the layering of memories, and the branching of decisions that comprise our cognitive landscape.\n\nWith varying densities, the crisscrossing lines represent neural connections and the meandering paths of thought and emotion. They symbolize our choices, the memories we revisit, and the emotions we intertwine, sometimes leading to clarity and other times to greater complexity.\n\n\"Cognitive Maze\" is a mental map and a dynamic puzzle, where the journey is more significant than the destination. Each piece in the series offers a glimpse into a unique mind's twists and turns, challenging viewers to navigate their cognitive maze. Where do your paths lead, and where might you become lost? What treasures of self-awareness and understanding lie at the heart of your labyrinth?\n\n¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬\n\nPress [s] to download the image.\n\nMade with P5JS and Chroma.js\n\nOptimized and best viewed in Chrome on a laptop/desktop.\nTested on Firefox / Brave / Opera / Edge on Windows.\n\nThis project is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬¬\n\nA huge thanks to everyone who joined in on this project – your input and effort were excellent!\nYour collaboration rocks!\n\n",

            "description": "Lines, our simple geometric friends, are nice and neat ideal forms. Until they’re not. Here they shake, crumble, twist and bend. Just like everything else in our fragile world. We put a lot of faith in lines, from marking out political borders to defining our designs, but maybe they aren’t as reliable as they seem.\n\nIn this work we make small, probing journeys into the space between pure shiny mathematics and the brittle chaos of materiality that this math tries to define. Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.\n\nI like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!\n\nMade with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.\n\nThere’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter. Sometimes unnoticed, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with angst. But always with a kind of truth. And I hope this work can conjure a kind of hazy evocation of all this. The message is only meant to be a feeling, at most.\n\n## Generate a printable version\n\nTo generate a version for printing, add the search parameter `?print=true` to the url. This disables the initial animation and doens't trigger a canvas resize when the window changes size.\n\nYou can then also add your preferred width of canvas by adding a `width` parameter, eg: `?print=true&width=2000`. Depending on your browser there's a limit to the maximum width you can use. Using Chrome on an Apple M1 laptop, I can go up to a width of 4700px, but experiment with what works for you.\n\nOnce the image is ready, press [s] on your keyboard to save as a PNG.\n\nTested in all major browsers on Apple silicon and on windows PC with an Intel chip.",

            "description": "Lines, our simple geometric friends, are nice and neat ideal forms. Until they’re not. Here they shake, crumble, twist and bend. Just like everything else in our fragile world. We put a lot of faith in lines, from marking out political borders to defining our designs, but maybe they aren’t as reliable as they seem.\n\nIn this work we make small, probing journeys into the space between pure shiny mathematics and the brittle chaos of materiality that this math tries to define. Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.\n\nI like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!\n\nMade with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.\n\nThere’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter. Sometimes unnoticed, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with angst. But always with a kind of truth. And I hope this work can conjure a kind of hazy evocation of all this. The message is only meant to be a feeling, at most.\n\n## Generate a printable version\n\nTo generate a version for printing, add the search parameter `?print=true` to the url. This disables the initial animation and doens't trigger a canvas resize when the window changes size.\n\nYou can then also add your preferred width of canvas by adding a `width` parameter, eg: `?print=true&width=2000`. Depending on your browser there's a limit to the maximum width you can use. Using Chrome on an Apple M1 laptop, I can go up to a width of 4700px, but experiment with what works for you.\n\nOnce the image is ready, press [s] on your keyboard to save as a PNG.\n\nTested in all major browsers on Apple silicon and on windows PC with an Intel chip.",

            "description": "Lines, our simple geometric friends, are nice and neat ideal forms. Until they’re not. Here they shake, crumble, twist and bend. Just like everything else in our fragile world. We put a lot of faith in lines, from marking out political borders to defining our designs, but maybe they aren’t as reliable as they seem.\n\nIn this work we make small, probing journeys into the space between pure shiny mathematics and the brittle chaos of materiality that this math tries to define. Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.\n\nI like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!\n\nMade with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.\n\nThere’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter. Sometimes unnoticed, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with angst. But always with a kind of truth. And I hope this work can conjure a kind of hazy evocation of all this. The message is only meant to be a feeling, at most.\n\n## Generate a printable version\n\nTo generate a version for printing, add the search parameter `?print=true` to the url. This disables the initial animation and doens't trigger a canvas resize when the window changes size.\n\nYou can then also add your preferred width of canvas by adding a `width` parameter, eg: `?print=true&width=2000`. Depending on your browser there's a limit to the maximum width you can use. Using Chrome on an Apple M1 laptop, I can go up to a width of 4700px, but experiment with what works for you.\n\nOnce the image is ready, press [s] on your keyboard to save as a PNG.\n\nTested in all major browsers on Apple silicon and on windows PC with an Intel chip.",
