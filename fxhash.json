            "description": "\"the Pazyryk\"\n\"In the years 1326 to 1328 of the Solar Hijri calendar (equivalent to 1947–1949 AD), during a time when the Pazyryk carpet, the world's oldest known carpet, was discovered by Sergei Rudenko, a Russian archaeologist, in the Pazyryk Valley. This woolen carpet, adorned with vibrant colors, depicts images of horse riders, grazing deer, and mythical creatures.\n\nIn 'the Pazyryk' collection, inspired by the Pazyryk carpet and the exquisite artistry of carpets and kilims from the eastern regions, an exceptional display of the essence of color in abstract art has emerged. This collection has transformed into a comprehensive exhibition of timeless historical and artistic endeavors, offering viewers an innovative and profound experience through a wide spectrum of colors and artistic creativity.\n\nThe Pazyryk collection has been meticulously designed using 153 different color palettes and three distinct sizes with high resolution suitable for printing. This collection aims to present the colors, essence, and art of the eastern regions to the audience. Each color palette acts as a testimony to the amalgamation of emotions and insights of prominent artists throughout art history. Every color palette has been meticulously derived from the works of these famous artists, representing a fusion of interpretation and personal perspective. These palettes convey an abstract representation of artistic and technological trends, where color and coding techniques blend harmoniously.\n\nBy merging historical art with contemporary innovations, The Pazyryk reflects a living connection between the history of art and contemporary artistic currents. In this piece, I have endeavored to provide the audience with an abstract bridge for a deeper understanding of new art and creativity. Just as sunlight rapidly and captivatingly reflects off stained glass windows of eastern palaces, spreading a unique tapestry of light and shadow on the walls and floors, The Pazyryk conveys a distinctive experience of art and history through the rare abstraction of color and light. Each color palette simultaneously encapsulates a visualization of history and contemporary reflections, inviting us to a mesmerizing celebration of colors and forms.\n\n-\"To propagate the essence of My wonderful community, 50% of the royalty from each secondary sale will be attributed to minters.\"\n\nNOTE: \"This code follows a complex algorithm for its creation, so you may need to wait a bit for each result to load. I'm confident that an intriguing outcome is awaiting you.\"\nPress 's': Export PNG image (current output scale)\n\nCreated with p5.js in August 2023 by @ChistAi.💙",

            "description": "“And in the bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes boiled in from the edge of space, hypnagogic images jerking past like a film compiled of random frames.”\nWilliam Gibson, “Neuromancer”, 1984\n\n\nrtrdgtzr (/ˈɹɛ.tɹoʊ ˈdɪdʒɪtaɪzə(ɹ)/, pronounced same as retro digitizer) is a long-form collaborative collection celebrating pixel and glitch art, graphics from the '80s and '90s, and techno-dystopian aesthetics of William Gibson's novels. What you see when you open the minting interface is an editor which takes an input image provided by the minter, applies generative post-processing to it, and finally outputs an animated composition. The input image itself is compressed and stored on-chain through params mechanic as a signal in string format, retrieved every time the artwork is regenerated. Minters are in fact authors of minted tokens, implicit collaborators, who are appropriately entitled to half the royalties. To facilitate co-creation, minting process provides an intuitive interface as well as WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) for full control of the output. Effect stacks in rtrdgtzr were originally developed for the ǥᵍłˡŧᵗȼᶜħʰvᵛɍʳsˢ collection released on GlitchForge in 2023 and feature customized diffusion dithering and aberrated pixel sorting. In terms of narrative and aesthetics, these two collections form an artistic continuum.\n\nMinting interface is designed to guide the minter through the whole process in a user-friendly way. Quick visual guide as well as technical aspects of the collection are described in detail in the accompanying fx(text) article “rtrdgtzr – Minter’s Guide”. Please read it before proceeding with the mint. For more info on the curation process, please follow us on social media. If you want to contribute as an artist, reach out!\n\nThe collaborative minting process was greatly inspired by “Universal Rayhatcher” from Piter Pasma and “Pensado a mano” collections from Alejandro Campos, both innovative at the time in their use of params mechanics. As we see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in, rtrdgtzr is also an official entry to the fxhackathon 2023: co-creation interfaces. We hope its openness and experimental character will serve as inspiration to others. But primarily, we hope it will inspire artists who don’t work with code to contribute to it.\n\n\nKey controls:\ng: export gif animation (current output scale)\ns: export png image (current output scale)\nleft + right arrow: change output scale (1x-10x)\nb: toggle page background color\np: pause / run animation\n\nNOTE: Minting should be done from a desktop device as the interface does not support mobile browsers (unless you find a way to drag-and-drop the image onto the canvas, in which case you’re good to go).\n\nCreated with p5.js in 2023 by {protocell:labs}.",

Imagine myself at the center of a virtual world, where the rules of art and science merge into a harmonious dance.\n\nIn the center of the stage stands the \"Cellular Automaton,\" a digital entity with a life of its own. This entity is composed of a grid of cells, each with a state, 0 or 1, like two actors taking turns on the stage. Each turn, these actors follow a pre-defined script, the \"rules,\" which change their state based on their past behavior. It's as if the stage itself is a fabric in constant transformation, woven by the very rules.\n\nBeyond the main stage, there's a secondary dance in progress. Here, \"particles\" elegantly move through a flow field. This field is generated by the art of noise, where chaos and randomness create seemingly random beauty. The particles follow the flow, dancing through invisible currents, like leaves drifting in a mountain stream.\n\nThe particles themselves are like digital brushstrokes on the virtual canvas. Each particle has a position, a velocity, and a color. When a particle passes through a certain region, the color on the canvas changes, like a work of art evolving and transforming. It's a symphony of shapes and colors, guided by mathematics and randomness.\n\nAs the show progresses, the digital world comes to life, creating a unique visual and artistic experience. It's an ever-evolving work of art, a harmony between the precision of mathematical rules and the freedom of artistic expression.

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution. I tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge / Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iPhone, but please make sure it works on your device before minting.\n\n-----\n\nPossible features:\n\ncolor scheme: cairngorm, alborz, bardenas, atlas, bieszczady, watkins\n\nproportions: square, wide, standard, narrow\n\nframe: none, vignette, bright, dark, bright with vignette, dark with vignette\n\nvisitors: tourists, tourists and birds, solitary flock of birds, only light\n",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "\"As Above So Below. As Within So Without\" is a verse that suggests that the microcosm and the macrocosm are reflections of each other. It means that the world around us is a reflection of our inner world, and vice versa. Also implies that the universe is a harmonious whole that everything is interconnected.\n\nI use circle, dashed line and transparent filling as a base form to construct a framework that generates images which attempt to represent the mind and thoughts of this verse.\n\nThe \"BaseCircle\" Feature means that how many circle was used as a starting point to expand to the whole canvas. Those rules construct different forms in visuals of harmony . Hope you like the abstract and the concrete of this work.\n\nDone by P5js.
