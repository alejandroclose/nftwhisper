There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project. \n\nFile Size: 5100 x 6600\nPress ’s’ to save the image as a .jpg\nPress ‘p’ to save the images as a .png\n\n//= Tiller, 2024\n",

Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit.

The canvas becomes a canvas of the mind, where emotions and thoughts blend and clash in a symphony of color and form. The bold strokes and rich palette evoke a wide range of feelings. It's an invitation to delve into the kaleidoscope of emotions that shape our lives and reflect upon the beauty that emerges when thoughts and feelings merge on the canvas of our existence.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nThe collection is made in pure code with p5.js.\n\nThe piece is my first work being published.

There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background.

What are they? Who made them? What are they trying to tell us? \n\nThese artefacts have been somehow pierced, leaving behind holes in distinctive but unknown patterns. Their surfaces have been marked by the passage of time. Maybe the patterns are a message. Or a map. Or a clue. \n\nPerforations explores the idea of communicating across vast time scales, where there is no common language between those who left the artefacts and those who found them. \n\nThe work invites us to imagine what information could have been so important that it needed to be recorded in this manner and left for future generations to discover. \n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nPress [p] = save an image (png) \nPress [v] = save a svg file\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nCreated with svg.js, wtc-math, d3-delaunay",

The bulk beings can influence gravity within any of those time frames.''\n(https://interstellarfilm.fandom.com/wiki/Tesseract)\n\nThe work presents the observation of the universe from a tesseract. I tried to symbolize the past through form of sketches and drawings, the present with a current view inside the Tesseract, and the future with the occasional showing of supernovas and black holes in some iterations.\n\nIt's amazing how far we've come as a human race, from sketching with charcoal to coding, from walking through the desert to traveling through space.\n\nI hope that this chaotic collection will make sense to you despite its illogicality.\n\n\nOptions:\n\n- press 's' to save the PNG image of the current view\n- press 'd' to save a hi-res PNG image\n\nCreated using p5.js\nBajiru, July 2023.",

            "description": "Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project. \n\nFile Size: 5100 x 6600\nPress ’s’ to save the image as a .jpg\nPress ‘p’ to save the images as a .png\n\n//= Tiller, 2024\n",

Almost all from Latin America.\n\n----------control keys------------ \n[F12] access to the meta-poem on browser console \n----------------------------------\n[p] alternate format portrait/square \n[o] border on/off \n[e] save image with 2000 pixels height\n[m] save image with 4000 pixels height\n[a] save image with actual size\n----------------------------------\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n----------------------------------\nCreated with p5.js\nTested in Chrome and Firefox on both Windows and Mac OS.\n\n----------------------------------\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2024\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada\n\n----------------------------------\n*Please note: there are two reservation lists in this project:\n-> One for my supporters & anyone who has 4 or more editions from my previous projects\n-> Another one for those who have one piece from any of my projects (this list is overallocated, which means there are more people on it than available slots, so: first come, first served).\n*If you use more than one wallet, or the address on the reserve list is your vault, contact me via one of my social networks up to 12 hours before the drop.\n----------------------------------",
