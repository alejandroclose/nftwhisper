            "description": "Kyma (/kee-ma/, κύμα) is a Greek word meaning wave. It is my exploration of an acoustic phenomenon known as ‘Chladni Patterns’. \n\nErnst Florens Friedrich Chladni was a German physicist and musician. He was a pioneer of modern acoustics and made numerous contributions to the field. Chladni's work had a significant influence on the development of modern music theory and the technology of musical instruments. In 1787, Chladni was trying to understand how sound waves propagate and interact with objects. By vibrating a metal plate and sprinkling sand on it, he observed that the sand arranged itself into distinct patterns. These patterns are created due to the interaction between the sound waves and the plate: the sound waves cause the plate to vibrate, which in turn causes the sand to move. The sand will move away from areas of high vibration and towards areas of low vibration. This creates a unique pattern of ridges, circles, and many other shapes.\n\nKyma continues this study by adding color, light, and composition to the equation. Each iteration is a unique combination of two Chladni plates with different characteristics, accompanied by a palette, background lighting, and variational drawing algorithm. Plates interact with each other, forming patterns from the small detailed net-like grid to megalithic sculptures of unknown creatures and windows to another worlds.\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.\n\nRendering can be computationally heavy, please be patient and give it some time to draw.\nChrome is highly recommended for live mode and high res saving.\n\nMade with love, math, and p5js. \n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG 2400 x 1600\n[2] - save PNG 4800 x 3200\n[3] - save PNG 9600 x 6400\n[4] - save PNG 14400 x 9600",

All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n“Southern Gothic” borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",
