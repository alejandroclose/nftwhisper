Franke. \nhttps://www.tribute-hwf.com/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUndisputably, my mathematical background makes me naturally attracted to graphs, math functions, and transformations. I use math in ways that mathematicians could consider nonsense, but which produce fascinating aesthetic elements for creation (to paraphrase Herbert W. Franke). Combining scientific symbols and illustrations with fictional data produces pseudo-persuasive generative imagery that we can easily take to be absolute truth or in which we find meaningful patterns.\nIn the special issue of Leonardo, Visual Mathematics from 1992, Herbert W. Franke and Horst S. Helbig published the article Generative Mathematics: Mathematically Described and Calculated Visual Art.\n\nThey propose that “Through the use of [mathematical] formulas (software) we gain generative principles. Beyond formal descriptions, we obtain guides for the construction of images. For example, if we use a parametric representation of a curve, the result is similar to traditional methods of drawing and painting […]“ Additionally, mathematics removes frame limits and adds the possibilities for transitions, transformations, movement, and interaction by implementing simple changes to the defining parameters.\n\nI’m also very fond of the analysis and comparison (mentioned there) of digitally generated images and Constructivist design. Limitations of the technology (in the 70s) allowed only simple line drawings, based on fixed proportions same as Constructivists did. “In a short time, all possible features were exhausted, so it became an obvious goal to try to extend them. This was done first by the use of random generators — a highly interesting expansion of design principles […]” Another expansion happened by adding curved shapes, first simple then complex that overcame possibilities of drawing with compasses and rulers. “[…] oscillating curves are easily obtained through mathematical formulas and computer-graphic systems. The results we achieve on this basis do not look like Constructivist presentations, but their rationality and precision derive from Constructivist principles. ”\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nEach mint contains both dark and light version, use D/N keys to switch between “day & night”.\n \nBase shapes are circles or Lissajous curves modified by the noise function. Shapes are arranged in a grid or by a circle packing algorithm. Lines are drawn smoothly or in stripes. Around 20% of the mints have lines in only one color (black/white). \n\nDepending on the browser/configuration rendering times will vary. \n",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.

A form that celebrates the continuity of digital variation while respecting a discrete approach to a digital whole.\n\nIt is a generative follow-up to the project CM.CollabWood, where the same parts were embedded in a real-time participatory architectural environment, where clusters of parts were placed by participants in real-time in collective design sessions to create tangible collective open forms.\n\n___________________________________________________\nControls:\n• 'P' pause/play animation\n• 'B' monochrome mode (wait a bit for recalculation)\n\nResize Canvas in live/open mode:\n(press once and wait for recalculation!)\n• 'DoubleClick' go Fullscreen\n• '1' square 1024x1024\n• '2' square 2048x2048\n• '3' square 3072x3072\n• '4' square 4096x4096 (might not work on all laptops)\n• '5' landscape 4000x3000\n• '6' portrait 3000x4000\n• '7' fullHD 1920x1080\n• '8' UHD 3840 x 2160\n• '9' square small(for sharing a gif on twitter) 512x512\n• '0' flex. adapt to current window size\n\nSave & Export in live/open mode:\n• 's' save a .png of in current resolution\n• 'g' save a seamless loop .gif in current resolution\n(press the key and wait for export, might take some time, consider with higher resolutions files get pretty big)\n\nSteps to save a gif/png :\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• resize canvas to your desired resolution (wait)\n• press s or g and wait for recalculation & download to finish\n• enjoy elasticity :)\n___________________________________________________\n\n\nThis token may not work on mobile(!), but it allows exporting .png and .gif (see controls) to enjoy elasticity on different displays or mobile.

            "description": "The existing nature grows on the unexisting spirits.\n\nGenerative sketch, based on the pen and ink drawings of Po Sheng Chen. Po Sheng Chen is an Architect who has drawn nothing but Architecture for over 25 years. He tried to explore something different from his previous style (Brutalism with Magical Realism), so developed his own Minimalist Architecture process and style. After breaking up all the complicated elements and symbols, he chose a simple and naive way to present “pure volumes in the space (the essential of Architecture)”: the Use of different densities of vertical lines to create different faces of volumes, with the addition of horizontal lines to create shadows on the volumes. Shadow determined the form of volumes, then they became a clear composition in the space, Eliminating chaos. These lines seem like spirits to Po Sheng Chen, because they represent the soul of Architecture, but they do not have a specific form or meaning...they are between existing and unexisting! Tezumie is a creative generative artist. He saw the latest experimental drawings of Po Sheng Chen, and after reaching out, the collab was formed with the goal of creating a digital representation of the original concept surrounded by a natural and overgrown environment. The combination of nature and architecture.\n\nMade in p5js.\n",

They are an attempt to capture a specific, singular handwriting, and evolve it using code. \n• See the original, 2014 handmade version here - https://pobbles.tez.page..\n• Alternative titles considered include Peggles™, Plops™, Blobbies™, Floofs™, Flintstones™, Lardies™, Plumps™, Fats™ and Wet-Ones™. \n• The pobbles are written entirely in paper.js and p5.js. \n• The pobbles are an effort to take generative art into the realm of the cute. \n• They work well with toddlers.\n\n🖨️ Collectors minting at the first auction tier receive a hand-crafted riso print of their pobble. Color variation between the file and the print will apply. 🖨️",

We're here for our families, our friends, and our community. Like everything in life, there are joyful times and challenging times. We must accept happiness as something that is not constant but that we feel at times (a \"tratti\" in Italian).\n\nWith \"tratti\", we want to send a message to every disheartened human being: \"Stay strong and never let anyone or anything crush the hope in you.

            "description": "This project is a playful attempt to depict how Neo-plasticism painters abstracted compositions, inspired and a tribute to the \"De Stijl\" movement, drawn using statically rendered block elements. The visual language reminds the original designs of famous artists of this art movement; in this project, each color palette is categorized by the name of a favorite piece of these artists. These palettes are sometimes determined by the color combination of this artist's works, which form the visual identity of their works from the color dimension.\nIn this project, different nodes are simple orthogonal shapes of color spots and thin lines to demarcate colors. I tried to create a dynamic effect by questioning the usual signs of vision in the abstract works of this period, to modify the relationship between them profoundly, and to show another field of my understanding of this movement by drawing a personal space.\nThe colors red, black, blue, and yellow were used from this turning point in the Neo-plasticism that the artists of the 'De Stijl movement cared about.\nSubtle black lines separate the vast rectangles, which for some are filled with bright or black, or gray; each small component is a member to create a whole and a single visualization, and each aspect of the components receives its visual value from the whole.\nThis work has set 27 color palettes and three variations to shape different rarities. It is better to set the browser to standard mode to see the effect better.\n\nDe Stijl\n \nThe style \"De Stijl\" of the Dutch avant-garde movement is an essential key to understanding the sources of the modern movement. The movement is organized around three central figures: the painter Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg and the furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld. Other core members are the painters Bart van der Leck, Georges Vantongerlo, and Willmus Huzar; the architects J.J.P Oud, Robert van Hoff, and Jan Wills; the poet Anthony Cook, later the graphic designer Piet Zwart and the architect Cornelis van Stern.\nIn 1918, a year after the official founding of the group and publication of the magazine's first issue that published and publicized the movement's doctrine, the creators of De Stijl combined the aesthetic and social vision. The group's first manifesto calls for a new balance between the individual and the universal and fights to free art from the limitations of the cult of individualism. \n \nDe Stijl originates both in the Hegelian tradition and in the Theosophical movement, then spreading in the Netherlands, both a utopian vision and a commitment to the production of the reality of the industrial world. However, it is a formal, plastic, pictorial, or architectural transcription of the principles of universal harmony that its creators implement. Painting, sculpture, furniture design, graphic design, architecture, and soon urban planning support this experiment, carried out simultaneously by different group creators. De Style productions naturally go beyond the traditional and academic division between primary and secondary arts, decorative arts, architecture, and urban planning.\nFrom the realm of the mind to the city, this can be the guiding thread for the evolution of the Style's productions during its fourteen years of life. The spatial nature of the work of art gradually reaches from the status of supporting the analysis of the world to a factor in building the social and political environment of the city. In this way, the spatialization of the work forms an experience of the world, gives order to the world, and gives essence to society. \nThe Style's priority is to invent an official language that responds to the challenges of the industrial society after World War I and outlines strategies for implementing the new social order.\nThe method of this vision is Neo-plasticism, which initially consists in radicalizing the approach of the contemporary avant-gardes.",

            "description": "This idea was born from recent discussion on generative art and the path the medium is finding for itself. The project aims to take aesthetic concepts from sci fi graphic novels and blend them with generative systems of abstraction. \n\nThe debate is between using previously established art forms to influence this new medium, or using a new medium to meticulously reproduce a previous medium. I believe there’s room to explore the full spectrum, and I am attempting to find the midpoint that fits my work and brings me the most happiness.\n\nThe title describes the eventual aesthetic objective, which is to create a piece which might look like a splash page a colorist alone has been given the freedom to design and explore their own specialty. It explores centralized polar compositions, vibrant colors, plus lots and lots of movement. 60# paper is a standard weight for printing of comic books and graphic novels.\n\nPress ’s’ in live view to save a .png\n\nCreated with p5.js and chroma.js\n",
