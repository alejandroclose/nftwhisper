A subdivision surface algorithm is recursive in nature: the process starts with a base level of area, and a refinement scheme is then applied to this field. This process takes that element and subdivides it, creating new segmented areas. The positions of the new areas are computed based on the positions of nearby old fields, edges, and/or faces. A cellular automata is running on the texture of some of these areas, building continuous, tautological worlds of binary patterns and relationships. Thus, unfolding of a pixel’s ‘umwelt’ can be witnessed through the slow, contemplative process.\n\nThe audio synthesis consists of a stochastic melody that emerges along the division of the new areas and territories within the image structure.

Looking back at the scores of our lives, the notations are never neatly noted, but fully felt.  Rewinding the songs of life are our memories, whether sad, happy, angry, or melancholy. It is not clear whether I am dreaming or awake, but our songs all do end. \n\nIn this final drop (for ?), I have reused the first ever class calligraphy(){} I have written from my genesis drop “Nothing comes from nothing”. As time passes, 10 drops later, across almost to the year, I am grateful for the progress I have made, as an artist, and more importantly as a human. After all, what is behind the code of generative art is a human being. \n\nScores of music, scrolls of calligraphy, calendar or diary, notating life, time passes, and changes are inevitable. Sometimes we sing louder in laughter and joy, sometimes we scribble in uneasiness, sometimes we just get lost in neon lights. Life goes on. You and me, all the same and yet different.  \n\nThere are too many friend artists, friend collectors, fxhash team members, to thank for helping me through this journey. I would like to pay homage to Rudxane in this work, who has taken me under his wings, mentoring and encouraging me in art as well as showing me some degen stuff on the side:-). This homage is not copy-minting, or copying of styles, which I do not have the coding skills to do so even if I wanted to. But it is the influence of taste in many works of Rudxane. In a vague but agreeable taste, I present to you Life has no scores. \n\nWhat I was taught was disrupted, and grid studies left unfinished, and oh do we have a BINGO?\n\nTested on Chrome.

            "description": "As the abandoned sewage planet Xnor lay seemingly dormant, aeons crept by. Erosion and oxidation recombined in plumbing, slowly causing the pipes to evolve sentience and grow to the horizon in a blooming chaos of rust, steel and concrete.\n\nIndustrial Devolution is the first long-form generative project using my rayhatching algorithm. It combines a raymarcher for SDFs with a surface orientation based flow field renderer in order to draw arbitrary 3D scenes as line art, with an organic, hatched drawing style. The SDF formulas were generatively designed and parametrized to form ancient landscapes of corroded industrial pipes and immense, ageless blocks of concrete.\n\nThe entire code of Industrial Devolution is 3930 characters, using no external libraries.\n\nWhen done rendering, the output can be right-click saved as an SVG file and plotted using a plotter such as an Axidraw. The lines in the SVG are in random order, so it is recommended to use a path reordering/optimizing tool such as axicli or vpype before plotting. This will greatly reduce the plotting time. The output SVG is intended to be plotted at A3 (297x420mm) using a 0.4mm black pen (but feel free to experiment). You can change this by adding these options to the URL:\n\n  &lw=.4 the linewidth in millimetres\n  &d=.8 the line density (multiplier to the line width, density 0.6 recommended for plotter output)\n  &h=420 how high the page is, in millimetres (width is always height * 0.707)\n  &bg=1 set to 0 to remove background rectangle (bg=0 recommended for plotter output)\n\nIndustrial Devolution was released during a live minting event at Bright Moments Gallery, Venice Beach in collaboration with Bright Moments, fx(hash) and Tender.\n",

Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.\n\nTraditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry (pâte feuilletée), alternating with two layers of pastry cream (crème pâtissière). The top pastry layer is finished in various ways: sometimes it is topped with whipped cream, or it may be dusted with icing sugar, cocoa, pastry crumbs, or sliced almonds. It may also be glazed with icing or fondant alone, or in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) or other colored icing stripes, and combed to create a marbled effect.\" — Wikipedia\n\nPrints available upon request: prints@stefancontiero.com\nBest enjoyed on browsers supporting Display-P3 color gamut.\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n@stefan_contiero\n",

Scale symmetry is used to create patterns that repeat at ever-smaller intervals, creating the illusion of infinite depth and complexity.\n\nThe rule for the recursive loop is incredibly simple. A box is drawn, then a snapshot of the full canvas is resized to cover the boundary. As this process is repeated, small variations in position create endless fractals.\n\nThis project is an experimental cross-chain collection, with a fully-generative A-side published via Art Blocks on Ethereum and an AI-based image composition B-side published via fxhash on Tezos. The artwork symbolizes the great divides we must cross, the connections we make along the way, and the disconnections we feel. We move through the world as the world moves through us.",

PixlFlippr operates on a pixel level (in the form of a GLSL frag shader).\n\nEvery pixel oscillates at a single fixed frequency, slightly out-of-sync with its neighbors. There is no explicit pixel-neighborhood communication (as there would be in eg Cellular Automata), and every pixel acts autonomously, oblivious to its surroundings. Yet collectively, the entire system exhibits constantly evolving complex high level behavior on many scales, ranging from patterns & behaviors spanning a few pixels, all the way up to the level of the entire image. These are further amplified through the emergent pixel aliasing artefacts & moiré patterns. \n\nAlso, it's trippy af. \n\nPS All generative mints are a seamless loop with a loop duration ranging from a few minutes to over an hour. So stick around & watch it mutate!",

Seed pixels begin to propagate themselves outwards, based initial conditions. After the space has been filled, the algorithm will pause, and then new mountain building will commence.\n\nFeatures:\n- Pixel Detail: Low 60%, Medium 30%, or High 10%. Controls the resolution of the grid\n- Color Mode: Multi-hued 85%, Duotone 10%, or Black and White 5%. Multihued palettes change slowly over time. If you aren't happy at first, wait a few minutes and it will evolve\n- Avalanche: Can be either None 80%, Falling 15%, or Rising 5%. This controls color animation separate from the pixel expansion\n- Peak Type: Crowded 50%, Clustered 25%, Coupled 17.5%, or Lonely 7.5%. # of seed pixels to start with\n- Organization: Tumbled 50%, Chaotic 40%, Ordered 10%. Controls the amount of randomness as the piece expands\n- Color Frequency: Variegated 50%, Soft 40%, Hyper 10% ",
