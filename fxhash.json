The template is aimed at TypeScript (but can be easily adapted to plain JavaScript) and, at the time of writing, uses Vite as dev & build tool, ensuring an altogether great & speedy workflow with minimal fuzz.\n\n(In the future, I'm aiming to provide an alternative version for more advanced hybrid projects using TypeScript, Zig (https://ziglang.org) and WebAssembly (https://webassembly.org/)...)\n\nFramework agnostic\n\nEven though several packages from the https://thi.ng/umbrella ecosystem are used to provide various essential overarching functionality, the template is organized in such a way that the main parts are completely framework-agnostic. You should be able to easily plug in your own toolkit of choice, however I cannot promise to provide support for this myself (though happy to accept PRs, also in terms of further docs, how-tos, guides etc.)\n\nExample project\n\nA tiny, fully documented throwaway example sketch is included, illustrating the following:\n\n- Overall project structure & build commands\n- FXhash related setup\n- Static & dynamic configuration and state (re)initialization (via dependency graph)\n- FXhash PRNG wrapper & utilities\n- Canvas & SVG conversion/export/download\n- 2D geometry creation, transformation & drawing\n- Basic vector algebra example usage\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\n\n- space :  pause/play animation\n- x : download canvas as PNG\n- s : download SVG version\n\nIn case of doubt, it's this example project what is used here for minting. The funding, however, will be used for the further maintenance of both this project template and supporting my other open source work. 20% are also donated to the FXhash development team itself.\n\nThank you for your support! 🙏😍",

            "description": ">>> GAN ⫷glitch⫸ Ting Xu |  幹亭序 <<<\n\n• Generative glitch collage: More than simply a + b + c •\n\n\nAt the apex of Chinese calligraphy, Lantingji Xu, the preface, was written by the most renowned calligrapher in China, Wang Xizhi (王羲之).\n\nDuring the Spring Purification Ceremony, forty-two literati gathered along the banks of a coursing stream and engaged in a \"winding stream\" drinking contest: cups of wine were floated on the water upstream, and whenever a cup stopped in front of a guest, they had to compose a poem or otherwise drink the wine. At the end of the day, twenty-six literati composed thirty-seven poems in total and the Lantingji Xu, as a preface to the collection, was produced by Wang on the spot.\n\nIn the GTX collection, we create new intricate and expressive relationships between ink, paper, and pixels using Jimi's raw calligraphy work, their GAN offsprings, and Thomas's CHX-like glitch processing, generating unique calligraphy on mint and toasting at the same time.\n\n\nHow it works:\n\nCombining sets of raw layers that range from paintings, calligraphy, and GAN seeds, our algorithm applies an array of image processing magic, creating intricate novel outputs.\n\nWe have 102 raw layers separated into four groups. Each final output is formed by mixing and processing four randomly selected layers. \n\nGroup 1 contains textures, and it is composed of Jimi's paintings, GAN seeds from mixed custom models, and CLIP Guided Diffusions. \n\nGroup 2 contains Jimi's calligraphy work. \n\nGroup 3 contains GAN calligraphy seeds from custom models we trained on Jimi's body of work. \n\nGroup 4 contains digital grain textures.\nOur algorithm starts by selecting one layer from each group, assigning them sizes, opacities, orientations, and other parameters. Then it sets a dithering combination to be applied. We have eight combos formed by combining seven different custom dithering algorithms (3 at a time). \n\nAfter each dither gets applied to its corresponding layer, images get mixed using different blend modes to help combine them in fun ways. Afterwards, a couple more filters get applied to glue everything together. When all is said and done, final artworks get rendered onto the canvas.\n\nSit back, open the live view, and enjoy. \n\n\nAppreciate the art, not the speculation. Pay what you can. \n\nWith love, sweat, and tears –drops– \nJimi and Thomas.\n\n\nJimi's notes:\n\nI provided the calligraphy representing the extreme spectrum of my expression in brushwork and poetry. I also evaluated the GAN calligraphy outputs, helping Thomas hone the models. During the training process I was horrified and in awe by both the stupidity and sometimes brilliance of the GANs.\n\nThrough the layering techniques developed by Thomas, I have also gained new insights into calligraphy, taking it beyond brush, ink and paper. The spectrum of expression in calligraphy gets freed from traditional constraints in GTX. Fx(hash) calligraphy has become brush, code and screen. \n\nThomas does not read Chinese, but I was happy to let him crop my scrolls into square layers in ways he saw fit with the project's aesthetic. To my surprise, I did not only agree with his visual choices but also noticed how the illiterate crops had many Freudian slips. That is, my poetry made sense fractally. I think this is no coincidence for calligraphers that write their poetry. Calligraphy is more than the sum of beautiful brushstrokes and also greater than the sum of pretty characters. Calligraphy is the composition of space and semantics. Only in turn does meaning takes its place in parts of calligraphy. \n\n\nControls:\n[s] save as PNG.\n\n\nPaint / Ink / Photography –> GANs / Diffusions –> p5.js –> Blockchain\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2022 Thomas Noya and Jimi Wen\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n◉_◉ ◉_◉",

Would the AI ​​that created these mysterious gardens have memories of the scent of flowers in its brain?\nNo matter how well a machine imitates the human learning process, it has inherent limitations. Humans remember the situation by comprehensively utilizing the five senses, including not only the visual information of the flowers, but also the melodies that flowed at that moment, the buzzing of flying bees, the dizzying scent of flowers, and the warm sunlight. However, this AI only does fractional numerical calculations using only the given pixel RGB values.\n\nHumans with much more complex brains and computational systems are passionate about the images that AI creates. However, if you think about it a little, it seems that this interest may be a kind of leisurely relaxation for mature beings to watch the development of immature beings.\nThis AI doesn't even know what it just built.\n\n\n* Draw algorithmic strokes by reference the color of AI-generated flower garden.\n* One of 832 AI-generated seed images are randomly selected.\n* No property(traits), no rarity\n\n[Left click on the screen] : add strokes (Temporarily retouching)\n[S] Save to file\n\nMade with Love & P5.js & P5.beizer !\nNFT License 2.0\nBy CSLIM, 2022\n",

            "description": "The Corium is a roughly spherical mass (diameter ~1km), of currently unknown origins situated within the core region of the solar system's asteroid belt.\nThe body was discovered during a uranium extraction mission undertaken by ET Resources at the behest of Station 733-H (Mars colony) leadership, when ionising radiation levels detected by deployed surface craft exceeded equipment and personnel tolerance levels by many orders of magnitude.\n\nWhile ETR crew were quick to respond to local abort orders (27 minutes from initial readings to fleet reorientation); Station 733-H made the determination that radiation exposure levels were already far in excess of anything that could be reasonably mitigated upon the ETR fleet's return.\nThe ETR fleet was ordered to jettison fuel reserves under Section 9 of the Space Corporations Act (Mars) approximately 90 minutes after the readings were initially reported. It is understood that all deployed personnel accessed their barbiturate rations within the following 24 hours.\n\nThe fleet itself remains in position some ~3000kms from The Corium, with plans to relocate the vessels still underway (albeit a low priority).\n\n\nSTATION 733-H OBSERVATION REPORT SUMMARY (14.1.1)\n\nTo date, remote analysis suggests that the body is compositionally similar to corium deposits observed following terrestrial nuclear disasters, consisting of a range of solidified radioactive compounds as well as a number of currently unidentified metal alloys. More in-depth analysis has been impossible to date due to the rapid physical decay of personnel and equipment as their proximity to samples reach a critical threshold.\n\nAll samples have so far been extruded from the surface of The Corium via laser, and maneuvered into orbit around Mars at the edge of it's sphere of influence (at a distance of no less than 50,000kms from Station 733-H), via projectile barrage and gas envelopment.\n\nThe surface of The Corium itself is littered with an array of clearly engineered forms; radial and rectangular patterns, deep crevasses, mazes and grids with only a select few areas resembling the pools of lava observed where Corium has formed terrestrially (it is unclear whether these deposits have formed since the surface was initially engineered).\n\nThe accompanying files are LIDAR renders of the extracted samples in proximity to Station 733-H and are marked for dissemination to terrestrial research teams on Mars. Study of The Corium remains the sole priority of Station 733-H research personnel, as any risks presented to the solar system or its inhabitants are currently not well understood.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe piece will render from the top right and might take ~5-10 seconds to begin.\n\nAppend \"&print=true\" to the live render URL for a hi-res output.",

            "description": "'Tesseract' is a generative collection drawing on the concept of the cube from oneirology, the interpretation of dreams. In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

            "description": "GuilCity is the beginning of an exciting journey bringing Guillaume Cornet’s densely-packed cities into the generative realm with the help of Matthew’s (@frostbitten’s) magic touch.\n\nMatthew—with his background in coding and animation—enables a new opportunity to experience these cities like never before. Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey! \n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you’ve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n—\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n—\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n• https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n—\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others’ skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci à tous! Cheers!\n  - Guillaume Cornet, Matthew Seremet",
