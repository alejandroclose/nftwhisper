It's about the loneliness, energy dependency of our species and our interest towards monumental constructions.\n\n------\n\nIn 3541, when Solitude was far from its former glory, the high council was assembling; it's now time to find a new way to live. It has been centuries since our people started to harness the power of the stars, but they used every last bit of power to serve as a mass effort to bring people together and strengthen solidarity. But now just a few remain.. With a shortage of manpower and energy, everything decayed so quickly. Now this isolated civilization is built upon the dying stars and waiting for the eternal void. \n\nIt's time for the high council to assemble for one last time to decide what to do next…\n\n------\n\nThe first 5 collectors at the highest tier(60 xtz) will receive an airdrop of an additional edition minted by us and also will have a guaranteed reserve spot for our next collection.\n\nIn live mode, press ‘s’ to save as .png (4000 x 7111 px) - You can check the console to confirm if the render is finished.\n\nPlease beware there are some minor differences  -caused by different pixel densities- between the saved .png and work on the site.\n\nIt can take up to a minute to render or longer in low-performance computers.

            "description": "The first blueprint was found in 1947 on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.\nIt has been studied several times.\nNumerous theories arose trying to explain its origin.\nNone of them was decided conclusively.\n\nOne year ago, a rare group of waves coming from space was intercepted on earth.\nThis happened during the 2021 summer.\nIt was unclear if they were born from natural events.\nDying stars, black holes... Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n—--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n—--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n—--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022.

I like how this small set of line styles can evoke so many different kinds of imagery and scales: viral particles, confetti, accelerating to light speed, contrails, cities at night, a camp fire, snow falling...",

I like how this small set of line styles can evoke so many different kinds of imagery and scales: viral particles, confetti, accelerating to light speed, contrails, cities at night, a camp fire, snow falling...",
