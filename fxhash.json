This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers.

This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.\n\nMy deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.\n\nAn algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.\n\nNavigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. \n\nAnd lastly, a heartfelt dedication.

However, with the emergence of generative art and fxhash, computational static painting has become the new aesthetic.\n\nTexturism is an artwork that explores texture and color. By layering multiple strokes of colors, it aims to create an image with rich textures, embracing the intricate details in modern generative art paintings.",

            "description": "\"A mille-feuille (French pronunciation: ​[mil fœj], \"thousand-sheets\"), also known by the names Napoleon, vanilla slice, and custard slice, is a dessert made of puff pastry layered with pastry cream. Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.\n\nTraditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry (pâte feuilletée), alternating with two layers of pastry cream (crème pâtissière). The top pastry layer is finished in various ways: sometimes it is topped with whipped cream, or it may be dusted with icing sugar, cocoa, pastry crumbs, or sliced almonds. It may also be glazed with icing or fondant alone, or in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) or other colored icing stripes, and combed to create a marbled effect.\" — Wikipedia\n\nPrints available upon request: prints@stefancontiero.com\nBest enjoyed on browsers supporting Display-P3 color gamut.\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n@stefan_contiero\n",

Stick it in, turn it on, and try not to blink. Drawing inspiration from the kinetic wit of pop art, Secs will hammer you all night (and day) long with unpredictable outputs every few seconds. \n\nThis playful nod to the ever-changing, rapid-fire nature of NFT collecting and the attention economy derives from our collective fascination with the novelty of the new. \n \nJust as we experience, interpret, and appreciate art in our individual and uniquely transient ways, Secs embodies that same fluidity and whimsicality.  It toys with the concept of immediacy and ephemeral euphoria in a space where our innate senses race towards the next shiny object even before the digital paint dries on the last. \n\nSecs is drenched in cheeky innuendo, imaginative subtext, and flirtatious emojis, not-so-subtly alluding to the intoxicating rush of dopamine that drives both our deepest desires and riskiest NFT collecting. \n\nWhere art, satire, and the suggestive intertwine in an infinite supply of Secs.  \n\nabstractment \nOctober 2023\n_________\nmade with p5js\n\nYou shouldn’t enjoy Secs on your phone as it is more fun on a desktop.\nSee license.txt for relevant licensing information.\nTwemojis are preloaded to avoid dependencies associated with X/Twitter.\n\nIn Live View: \n-   ‘ ‘ (i.e., spacebar) to pause/unpause an infinite supply of Secs\n-   ‘p’ to save a png\n-   [(any number from 1 - 69) + enter] to view 1 of 69 saved hashes (unique to each token). \n-   ArrowUp / ArrowDown to incrementally increase / decrease the image quality.

            "description": "This piece is a reflection of my passions, a blend of the visual and the auditory, and a testament to the power of interdisciplinary inspiration.\n\nAt the very core of 'Cable Management' lies the mesmerizing aura of 'Impressions of Order' by nbswwit. This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.\n\nMy deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.\n\nAn algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.\n\nNavigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. \n\nAnd lastly, a heartfelt dedication. Through every line of code, every algorithm tweak, she remained my rock. Alice, as you embrace another year, this piece is not just an ode to my creative journey but also a heartfelt tribute to you, my biggest supporter since the outset. This project, and every beat of my heart, is for you. <3\n\n3500x4953px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

            "description": "This piece is a reflection of my passions, a blend of the visual and the auditory, and a testament to the power of interdisciplinary inspiration.\n\nAt the very core of 'Cable Management' lies the mesmerizing aura of 'Impressions of Order' by nbswwit. This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.\n\nMy deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.\n\nAn algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.\n\nNavigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. \n\nAnd lastly, a heartfelt dedication. Through every line of code, every algorithm tweak, she remained my rock. Alice, as you embrace another year, this piece is not just an ode to my creative journey but also a heartfelt tribute to you, my biggest supporter since the outset. This project, and every beat of my heart, is for you. <3\n\n3500x4953px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",
