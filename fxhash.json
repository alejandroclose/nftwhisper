            "description": "We’ve always known wallet addresses as strings of letters and numbers, Dry, soulless data, yet always present.\nBut what if this presence could breathe?\n\nIn the enhanced, living version of \"Season One\", we revisit that same idea, transforming the blockchain’s most essential elements into evolving pixelated lifeforms.\nEach artwork is still generated from the wallet address (`fxminter`) and the token’s hash (`fxhash`), but the project pulses with a new kind of energy this time.\n\n### What’s new in this evolved version:\n\n🕰 A Magical Clock\nA real-time clock has been embedded into the artwork. One that only ticks forward with each new mint.\nEach minted token captures a unique minute in time, held eternally by its collector.\nThis enchanted clock is not merely decorative. It holds a secret that will only be fully unveiled in \"Season Two\".\n\n🧩 A Fragment of the Bigger Picture\nAlongside the creature, every mint now receives a Roman numeral representing its mint number and a coordinate, marking its position in a hidden puzzle.\nEach token is a piece of a larger design; together, these fragments will reconstruct the gateway to the next season.\n\n🧬 Multiple Perspectives, One Identity\nThe core pixel creature, still generated uniquely from your wallet and hash, now appears in three views:\n\n* a breathing 2D form rendered in real time,\n* a puzzled isometric shape,\n* and a miniature preview of the final Season Two puzzle form, hinting at what’s to come.\n  Your identity is no longer shown from a single angle, it’s a multidimensional expression.\n\n🎨 Colors from the Hash, Signatures from the Wallet\nLike in the original version, all color palettes are derived directly from the hash. No two are alike.\nAnd, as always, your wallet address is subtly signed beneath the artwork, a permanent mark of authorship.\n\n---\n\nThis is not Season Two.\nThis is Season One: Alive, an evolved, living version of the original.\nIt preserves everything that made the first release special, but adds movement, time, spatial positioning, and hints of the next chapter.\n\nIf Season One was a spark, this version is its flame.\nOnly holders of these tokens will be able to step fully into Season Two and witness the transformation of their piece into its final narrative form.\nUntil then, this is your moment. Your pixel, your minute, your breath in the story.\n\nReptile 🦎\n----------\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

And I've used the concept of modulation, which can be translated to: altering the outcome of a function through the output of another function.\n\nYou can read further about the creation process in this article I wrote: https://esnho.github.io/from-ramps-to/",
