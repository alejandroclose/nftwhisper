Bezier curves may be uniform for an iteration, where the control points of the curves are generated from a single formula for the whole image, or they may be random. Strokes may also have horizontal and/or vertical 'line fuzz', where the start and end points of the line are randomly offset in either direction.\n\nStraight strokes may or may not have a solid base-layer drawn underneath, which gives the image a more filled vs. sketched appearance.

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective ClichÃ©\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

The canvas may have one or two borders, ranging from small to large, and the inner border may or may not have a coloured edge and fill.

Bezier curves may be uniform for an iteration, where the control points of the curves are generated from a single formula for the whole image, or they may be random. Strokes may also have horizontal and/or vertical 'line fuzz', where the start and end points of the line are randomly offset in either direction.\n\nStraight strokes may or may not have a solid base-layer drawn underneath, which gives the image a more filled vs. sketched appearance. Top strokes may also be partially transparent, allowing for a layered effect.\n\nColumns are drawn in one of several possible orders, and once the initial drawing is complete, columns will be redrawn slowly and the image will evolve over time.\n\nPress '2', '4', '6', '8', or '0' to re-draw at 2K, 4K, 6K, 8K, or 10K resolution (shortest edge), which will also save an image when the initial draw is complete and before animation begins.\n\nPress 's' at any time to save an image at the current resolution.",

The compositions that emerge may be harmonious or asynchronous, comforting or jarring, wistful, mysterious, subtle, or bold.\n\nThe piece is generated as follows:\n\nFirst, borders and columns are defined. The canvas may have one or two borders, ranging from small to large, and the inner border may or may not have a coloured edge and fill. If they are not coloured, the feature \"Hidden Background\" will be true. Each column is assigned three colours at random from one of several possible colour palettes. The top and bottom boundaries of each column are set, and in some iterations, there is a chance that columns will break outside the border boundaries.\n\nAs columns are drawn from top to bottom, there are several events that may occur with probabilities pre-defined for each iteration: 1) The stroke colour may switch abruptly or over a gradient between two of the three column colours. 2) A 'repeater' pattern may be triggered, where two of the column colours alternate with a given frequency and rate of decay. 3) Single 'accent' bands may occur with the third column colour. 4) 'Bulges' may form with either rectangle, diamond, sin wave, or 'skirt' shapes.\n\nThere may also be horizontal bands that span the entire image, with a certain variability of height across columns.\n\nStrokes may be straight lines or Bezier curves. Bezier curves may be uniform for an iteration, where the control points of the curves are generated from a single formula for the whole image, or they may be random. Strokes may also have horizontal and/or vertical 'line fuzz', where the start and end points of the line are randomly offset in either direction.\n\nStraight strokes may or may not have a solid base-layer drawn underneath, which gives the image a more filled vs. sketched appearance. Top strokes may also be partially transparent, allowing for a layered effect.\n\nColumns are drawn in one of several possible orders, and once the initial drawing is complete, columns will be redrawn slowly and the image will evolve over time.\n\nPress '2', '4', '6', '8', or '0' to re-draw at 2K, 4K, 6K, 8K, or 10K resolution (shortest edge), which will also save an image when the initial draw is complete and before animation begins.\n\nPress 's' at any time to save an image at the current resolution.",

The canvas may have one or two borders, ranging from small to large, and the inner border may or may not have a coloured edge and fill. If they are not coloured, the feature \"Hidden Background\" will be true. Each column is assigned three colours at random from one of several possible colour palettes. The top and bottom boundaries of each column are set, and in some iterations, there is a chance that columns will break outside the border boundaries.\n\nAs columns are drawn from top to bottom, there are several events that may occur with probabilities pre-defined for each iteration: 1) The stroke colour may switch abruptly or over a gradient between two of the three column colours. 2) A 'repeater' pattern may be triggered, where two of the column colours alternate with a given frequency and rate of decay. 3) Single 'accent' bands may occur with the third column colour. 4) 'Bulges' may form with either rectangle, diamond, sin wave, or 'skirt' shapes.\n\nThere may also be horizontal bands that span the entire image, with a certain variability of height across columns.\n\nStrokes may be straight lines or Bezier curves. Bezier curves may be uniform for an iteration, where the control points of the curves are generated from a single formula for the whole image, or they may be random. Strokes may also have horizontal and/or vertical 'line fuzz', where the start and end points of the line are randomly offset in either direction.\n\nStraight strokes may or may not have a solid base-layer drawn underneath, which gives the image a more filled vs. sketched appearance. Top strokes may also be partially transparent, allowing for a layered effect.\n\nColumns are drawn in one of several possible orders, and once the initial drawing is complete, columns will be redrawn slowly and the image will evolve over time.\n\nPress '2', '4', '6', '8', or '0' to re-draw at 2K, 4K, 6K, 8K, or 10K resolution (shortest edge), which will also save an image when the initial draw is complete and before animation begins.\n\nPress 's' at any time to save an image at the current resolution.",
