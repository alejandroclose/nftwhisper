            "description": "Tranquil Orbits: A Journey Through Calming Vortices, Ethereal Motion, and Meditations in Color\n\nIn the vast expanse of darkness, there lies a singular point of gravity, the anchor orb, a celestial body gently cradling smaller orbs in its embrace. The Tranquil Orbits project emerged from a fascination with the subtle dance of these heavenly bodies, bound together by invisible forces, their motions guided by the gentle hand of nature.\n\nThe journey of discovery for Tranquil Orbits began as an exploration of the organic nature of celestial movement. An observation of the night sky, with its infinite depth, stirred within a desire to capture the essence of this cosmic ballet. The art project took shape as a series of generative artworks, each a solitary color set against the black canvas of the void.\n\nIn this serene landscape, the anchor orb serves as a steadfast guide, providing a sense of stability in the midst of constant change. As the smaller orbs revolve around their celestial guardian, they appear to whisper secrets of the universe, sharing tales of worlds unseen and mysteries untold.\n\nThe Tranquil Orbits project is a quiet testament to the beauty of discovery, an invitation to wander through the cosmic expanse, and an ode to the ever-changing dance of celestial bodies. It is not a grandiose proclamation of artistic prowess, but rather a humble exploration of the intimate connection between the observer and the cosmos, where the lines between creation and observation blur and intertwine.\n\nIn the end, Tranquil Orbits is not solely about the final product, but rather the process of discovery, the joy of creation, and the subtle dance between order and chaos. It is an invitation to lose oneself in the infinite possibilities of the cosmos and to find solace in the tranquility of the celestial dance.\n_____________________________________________\n\nThe entire project is developed using Vanilla JS. It features a black canvas and a palette of 24 distinct colors, with one color assigned to each artwork. The artworks exhibit diversity in several aspects, such as the quantity and radii of orbs, the landscape, variations in orb textures, and some rare occurrences like eclipses.\n\nEach artwork is animated using a recursive algorithm, where the large orb gently rotates at its center while the smaller orb(s) revolve around it at varying speeds.

            "description": "Tranquil Orbits: A Journey Through Calming Vortices, Ethereal Motion, and Meditations in Color\n\nIn the vast expanse of darkness, there lies a singular point of gravity, the anchor orb, a celestial body gently cradling smaller orbs in its embrace. The Tranquil Orbits project emerged from a fascination with the subtle dance of these heavenly bodies, bound together by invisible forces, their motions guided by the gentle hand of nature.\n\nThe journey of discovery for Tranquil Orbits began as an exploration of the organic nature of celestial movement. An observation of the night sky, with its infinite depth, stirred within a desire to capture the essence of this cosmic ballet. The art project took shape as a series of generative artworks, each a solitary color set against the black canvas of the void.\n\nIn this serene landscape, the anchor orb serves as a steadfast guide, providing a sense of stability in the midst of constant change. As the smaller orbs revolve around their celestial guardian, they appear to whisper secrets of the universe, sharing tales of worlds unseen and mysteries untold.\n\nThe Tranquil Orbits project is a quiet testament to the beauty of discovery, an invitation to wander through the cosmic expanse, and an ode to the ever-changing dance of celestial bodies. It is not a grandiose proclamation of artistic prowess, but rather a humble exploration of the intimate connection between the observer and the cosmos, where the lines between creation and observation blur and intertwine.\n\nIn the end, Tranquil Orbits is not solely about the final product, but rather the process of discovery, the joy of creation, and the subtle dance between order and chaos. It is an invitation to lose oneself in the infinite possibilities of the cosmos and to find solace in the tranquility of the celestial dance.\n_____________________________________________\n\nThe entire project is developed using Vanilla JS. It features a black canvas and a palette of 24 distinct colors, with one color assigned to each artwork. The artworks exhibit diversity in several aspects, such as the quantity and radii of orbs, the landscape, variations in orb textures, and some rare occurrences like eclipses.\n\nEach artwork is animated using a recursive algorithm, where the large orb gently rotates at its center while the smaller orb(s) revolve around it at varying speeds. Users can control the rotational speed of the smaller orbs and alter their rotation direction. Although each artwork has a predefined position for all orbs, users can pause the animation and save the image in any preferred state.\n_____________________________________________\n\nTo interact with the artwork:\n-\tIncrease the rotational speed of the smaller orb(s) by pressing 'u'\n-\tDecrease the rotational speed of the smaller orb(s) by pressing 'd' or to change the direction of rotation. \n-\tThe animation responds to changes in rotational speed, but it may take a few seconds for the effects to become visible. Please wait for the effect to become visible after you press 'u' or 'd'. \n-\tPause the animation by pressing 'f'\n-\tStart the animation again by pressing 'b'\n-\tCapture a 2000 x 2000 image by pressing 'p' (this can be done during both paused and active animation). This will always generate an image with orbs in their current position.\n-\tSave an SVG file by pressing 's'. This will always generate an image with orbs in minted position.\n_____________________________________________\n\nretr0metr0, San Francisco, March 2023. \nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0.",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state. Press \"h\" to save it.\n\nUninhabitable is an original work by Iskra Velitchkova. 2021.",

            "description": "Uninhabitable is a generative system built only from ellipses. The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state. Press \"h\" to save it.\n\nUninhabitable is an original work by Iskra Velitchkova. 2021.",
