            "description": "Redols is a piece about the automated arrangement of geometrical shapes in space and how the images generated can foster different moods. It visually investigates how to adjust the amount of randomness and repetition -both in the code loops and in the visual composition- to create structures that contain the mere essence of geometry and of movement.\n\nIt explores the repetitive use of a simple geometric shape: the circle. Adds some counterpoints to enhance it: squares, lines, and triangles which are found in the background. It focuses on circular shapes, not always drawing exactly. They change their core, their measure, the color, the gradient, or some subtle details. The arrangement uses an elliptical distribution and replicates some shapes to promote the visual recognition of bigger parts thus enhancing the movement feeling.\n\nRedols is my genesis piece at fxhash curated by VerticalCrypto Art and Anika Meier.\nExhibited at IN TOUCH: art in the age of post-nftism show at Dekabinett, Berlin, september 2022.\n\nRedols means circular shapes, not perfect ones, in Catalan and is an investigation of how deterministic processes and algorithms can create appealing arrangements that foster non machinic agencies and sentiments.\n\nThe piece is created by code, coding it from scratch, mixing, and mastering basic drawing techniques. This approach pays attention to the art piece getting old -I hope well- and makes it easier to show and view it on different computers and platforms to prevent its obsolescence.\n\nI tested on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Mac OS, Ubuntu, Android, and iPhone in vertical and horizontal mode, but please check it works on your device before minting.\n\n----\npossible features:\n- colors:  super fosc marro, super blau, taronja-marro, taronja-blau, marro-taronja, marro-blau, blau-taronja, blau-marro.\n- fons: quadradets, escaires, diagonals.\n- fonsple: true, false.\n- redols: equilibrat, mironia, migmig, degradats, vespa, mandarina, us, os, pla.\n- fons2diagonals: true, false.\n\nAnna Carreras 2022",

Inspired by the ethereal interplay between dreams and reality, this masterpiece conjures flowers that dwell not in earthly gardens but in the imagination's boundless fields.\n\nEach bloom, a digital mirage, mirrors the complexity of human perception, capturing the myriad souls in its petals. Here, flowers are not merely seen; they are felt, as they embody the diverse essences of life, painted in strokes of unseen colors and shapes.\n\n\"The Soul of Flowers\" is a digital garden where each flower narrates its own poetic story, a fusion of art and technology that invites viewers to wander through a realm of beauty, redefining the boundaries between the virtual and the real.",

            "description": "A Cellular Dice Piece\n\nComputational modeling is the use of computers to simulate and study complex systems using mathematics, physics and computer science. A computational model contains numerous variables that characterize the system being studied. Simulation is done by adjusting the variables alone or in combination and observing the outcomes. Computer modeling allows scientists to conduct thousands of simulated experiments by computer. The thousands of computer experiments identify the handful of laboratory experiments that are most likely to solve the problem being studied.\n\nToday's sociocultural discourse might obscure the fact that humanity has been using artificial modeling techniques since ancient times. Permutations, calculus, algorithms are not exclusive to our time, but these are ubiquituous methods that can be found in many cultural entities where members of the community progress and develop their environment through cooperative decisions and consensus. Since computers were not available in the past, calculation methods, application of chance, randomness and probability were performed using other methods, like dices, sticks, cards, weather, rituals or other manifestations.\n\nDice are small, throwable objects with marked sides that can rest in multiple positions. They are used for generating random numbers, commonly as part of tabletop games, including dice games, board games, role-playing games, and games of chance. A traditional die is a cube with each of its six faces marked with a different number of dots (pips) from one to six. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing a random integer from one to six on its upper surface, with each value being equally likely. These tools were often used when a decision required to outsource human subjective elements into an objective environment.\n\nDivination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appears to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. If a distinction is to be made between divination and fortune-telling, divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a religious context, as seen in traditional African medicine. Divination has long been criticized. In the modern era, it has been dismissed by the scientific community and skeptics as being superstitious; experiments do not support the idea that divination techniques can actually predict the future more reliably or precisely than would be possible without it.\n\nThis idea is especially adaptable to the data driven belief systems of our time, where human decision making involves trust in omnipresent although obscure and biased artificial intelligence, esoteric pattern analysis, DIY heuristics, magic numbers among others. \n\nPress 'h' to switch between high/low resolution pixel density (set to low for mobiles)\n\nTouch to listen",

Well, here's something just as awesome - This is your chance to collect some trash straight from the King of Trash Art himself, Robness!\n\n---\n\nNOR44 & ROBNESS V2 JOIN FORCES TO CREATE A SPECIAL GENERATIVE PROJECT IN HONOR OF THE SECOND #TEZTRASH EVENT ON 12/21/22.  TEZTRASH IS A TEZOS COMMUNITY DAY WHEN THE CRYPTONATIVE ART MOVEMENT #TRASHART AND TRASH ART IN GENERAL IS CELEBRATED.  THE PREVIOUS TEZTRASH EVENT WAS A MONUMENTAL HIT ON TWITTER AND THIS TIME AROUND WE'VE DECIDED TO CONCOCT AN EPIC GENERATIVE DROP WHILST KEEPING THE TRASH ART ETHOS EMBEDDED IN THE WORK. HERE WE PLAY WITH THE NOTION OF 'TRASHING JPEGS' AND REINSERTING A PHYSICAL YET GENERATIVE REPRESENTATION OF THAT IDEA. ENJOY AND HAPPY TEZTRASH 2.0 DAY!\n\n---\n\nThis generative artwork is composed of many layers of pre-rendered images with code utilized to stylize as well as randomly position, rotate and scale these elements, creating potentially infinite unique compositions resembling real-world outputs from a Photocopier/Copy Machine that's seen better days.\n",
