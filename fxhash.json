            "description": "In march of this year, I started working on a new series involving multi-layering, and overriding shapes. Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

            "description": "White Mountain Winter is collaboration between myself and the machine to describe scenes that are real, or were. Yet perhaps now foreign, or out of time, or far away. I provide the seed of a dream I remember, and trust the machine to help make it real again.\n\nI grew up in a town much like some of these, homes dispersed throughout the valley beneath the shadows of the mountains rising around. This is a tribute to the memory of wintertime in that place; bleak, cold, grey, with the light seemingly always fading. Yet at the same time, the feeling of calm, solace, peace resonating through. Exposed to the mountain elements, yet protected by them. A delicate arrangement, but essential.\n\nThe seed of magic I remember is present in the experience of falling snow at dusk. Large flakes tumbling down and blanketing everything, no end in sight. The most striking thing is the silence. The fallen snow absorbing all distraction, insisting that your focus be sharpened to a singularity; right there, right then.\n\n---\n- Best rendered in Chrome browser (best performance, & canvas blur - please be patient :)\n- Made with p5js\n- Press \"s\" to save png",

            "description": "In march of this year, I started working on a new series involving multi-layering, and overriding shapes. Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

            "description": "In march of this year, I started working on a new series involving multi-layering, and overriding shapes. Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

The halftone effect works by placing very small dots next to each other to give the illusion of new shades and hues. Each Knockout samples three colors for the main composition and runs small sections of the canvas back through the machine after shuffling the base palette. The secondary passes vary in size, creating interesting emergent patterns on the overlap.\n\nPress 's' in live view to save a .png\n\nBuilt and tested with Chrome on Apple silicon.
