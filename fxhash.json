            "description": "'drawz' fxh_t019 is also vanilla javascript template for fxhash\n\n\nfeel free, to use (parts of) it, and learn from the source.\nand use it as a start for your own creative projects and adventures\n\nThis version has some extra routines you can use; \nand a lot of comments in the source\n\n\nA cleaned up - smaller version; just doing the basic tech screen & window-handeling etc. with just drawing dots can be found here.\n(and older and newer updated versions)\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\n\nMostly I start with a clean template; \nthen add: copy-paste routines into it. Things I want to use; sprites, text-font, filters, lines, 3D etc. \nLike kinda lego blocks. Some routines I re-use for 30 years now. \nAlthough often they have changed over time.\n\n\nVanilla javascript - And directly control your rgb buffer\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\ncons:\n- can be overwhelming for starting coders compared to p5js\n- you have to write / use and tinker with new drawing routines by yourself. \n- still can be optimized a lot, and run much faster\n-- (feel free to do that! - release new versions yourself)\n- I just coded it in Notepad++ and tested it in a browser.\n- I have no experience with git-hub, or those other nifty tools\n- I'm more an Artist than a coder, still learning new things as well.\n- I have my own 'old' coding style I picked up ages ago, and still use now and then. Started with basic and Z80a as a teenager.\n- for sure there are still some stupid bugs, spelling errors in it  ^___^\n\npros:\n- fxtemplate - fxpreview when done drawing / splash-screen support on top; while drawing.\n- do like 4000 x 4000 images on safari; on an old Iphone 5\n- just 1 index.html now - small file size: \n- the source of the 'cleaned-up' version is now 34b (not minified, and still comments in the source; can be even smaller)\n- direct control of the RGB buffer; every pixel.\n- I added some basic routines, like drawing points, lines, squares, sprite-brushes, filters, and my pixel-font\n- draw, add-mix or subtract - manipulate every pixel how you wish\n- I work with a big off-screen kind of image; a rgb-buffer; so drawing goes 'mucho' faster and render it to a screen-scaled image.\n- no other libraries used\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nMouse-click switches between:\n- screen scaled image\n- The large image \n\n- The work will refresh and restart after some time\n\nSave image - with s-key \n(includes the fxhash key-seed and num# of the follow-up images)\n--- It can take some seconds before the saving happens; \n--- the browser has to handle (very) large MB .png files first \n--- before it can save them \n\n- splash image support - to hide drawing at start\n- redraw the image after a while; or not.\n- mouse position check for the bigger image\n- fps counter for testing etc.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nwritten in vanilla JavaScript, more info in the source-code\n\n\ndrawz - latest or an updated version can be found at.\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\nIt would be nice; to include more routines into it\nin the future.\n\nAnd instead of 1 big library with everything in it\nI would like to have these templates; \nwhere you can add different little snippets and routines \nthat you want to use into it, and start playing next.\nStill learning new things as well. And getting inspired.\n\nI don't mind people to use the tech-source as a start for their own projects. \n\nBut the palette, and composition & structure build-up; is mine. \nDon't change just 1 or 2 -things then re-release it.\n\nIf you want to release something of your own,\nyour sketch and generative work; really should look total different!\nYou can use the technics to draw new things,\nbut you have to start from scratch again; \nchoosing points, lines etc. to play with and go from there.\nEnjoy! \n\n\n-for the love of Art and jumping in rain puddles-\n\n'like jimi and guitar'  0__.  ^____^\n\n\nxxx  amsterdam  chillout\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n",

To reset to all colors, press 'v'.\n\nYou can save a PNG file using 's', a JPG using 'd', a PNG with twice your window height using 'f', and a print size image using 'g'.\n\nThis work explores composition based on generative double grid system, where rotations, displacements and noisy lines intertwine to form a playful loom.\n\nCreated with p5.js rendering in WEBGL.",

A million thanks to the team. You are so appreciated as are the artists and collectors that have made this such a beautiful community. 🥂\n\nDefinitely check out “Forever” mode by tapping “F” or mouse click/tap — it will animate (you guessed it) forever and will change its layout every 365 frames, in honor of this wonderful year, and every year after. Some forever modes will “never forget” and others will fade as they progress. No idea if that’s a metaphor but it is a trait, that much I know.\n\nAll primary sales are donated to Code/Art, which is a charity that uses “…Art to Inspire Girls in Computer Science.” Read about Code/Art here: https://www.code-art.com/\n\nCeremony uses public domain art (which is the original, more implicit version CC0) made exclusively by women.\n\nSee fxtext article linked from the project page for a gallery of the source material and other notes.\n\nCeremony is also CC0, so feel free use anything here in other projects.\n\nYou can read more about CC0 here:\nhttps://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\n\nF : “Forever” mode (tap after initial render completes)\nP : Pause/Play\n(mouse click/tap also works to start “Forever” mode or Pause/Play)\n\nA : Add Grain (only works when paused in “Forever” mode.)\nG : Toggle Grain (resets the whole piece)\nM : Toggle Matte (resets the whole piece)\n\nS : Save Image\n1 -> 6 : Set pixel density (resets the whole piece)\n(Default pixel density is 1 @ 2000x2000)\n\nIf you want to start in \"Forever\" mode, you can append \"&forever=true\" to the url in the live view.\nYou can also add pixel density to the url by appending “&density=2” (or 3, 4, etc) to have it render at higher resolutions by default.",

            "description": "This token was created for THE PASSAGE: Pitch Drop experience, an interactive minting experience where your choices determine the design of your token. \n\nTo take part, please purchase an Edition 5 Coin on fx(hash) by HERE & NOW. The artwork and experience draw inspiration from the 'The Pitch Drop Experiment': the world's longest-running laboratory experiment. Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\n____\n\n\nWhile we wait for the 10th drop of pitch to fall in the famous Pitch Drop experiment, I couldn’t avoid thinking about time and change, capturing and preserving a moment of time, the history of art and science, and how we participate in the manipulation of the time itself.  \n\nThe history of new media art is deeply linked to technical developments in photography and its creative applications. With still and moving images, artists were introduced to a new way of visualizing time. Through the use of time lapses, long exposures, slowing down, and fast forwarding, time was manipulated, captured, rearranged, and modified in numerous ways.\n  \nThe French philosopher Henri Bergson believed that reality was in flux and that \"the essence of time is that it goes by.\" His thoughts about time and metaphysics had a significant impact on artists working in all media at the turn of the 20th century. Although he believed in pure perception unaided by machines, and looked down on the introduction of technology into the arts, for artists, who had always been fascinated with the body in space and time, he became their muse. Even before the widespread adoption of technological advances in artistic practices, painters were incorporating aspects of \"movement of time\" into their works (e.g., futurists, Giacomo Balla, but also Marcel Duchamp ). \n\nAnother influential figure for artists was Eadweard Muybridge. In 1878 he photographed a racehorse at full speed, becoming the first to capture what looked like the actual, discrete sequence of motion. After devising the system of several cameras (12 for the first sequence he made), set in a row and arranged to go off in a sequence (with shutters released by pulled strings), he became fascinated with “secrets of time, secrets locked inside basic human movements – a leap, a splash, a walk […]”*. \n\nAll of this inspired me to create and capture algorithmically generated shapes, and record their subtle changes through time and space in the style of vintage scientific illustrations, film strips, long-exposure photos, and comic book panels. Each frame inside this view is one fraction of a second later than the previous one, and the whole frame view is slightly shifted. Your actions inside of the Passage will influence everything, from the number of rows and columns inside of the grid to the color palettes, shapes, and sizes of the objects.\n\n_____\n* Jad Abumrad (host) & Rebecca Solnet (author) say this when they talk about Muybridge in the episode Time, on the Radiolab podcast, aired Aug 24, 2010 (https://radiolab.org/episodes/91584-time)\n",

Started with basic and Z80a as a teenager.\n- for sure there are still some stupid bugs, spelling errors in it  ^___^\n\npros:\n- fxtemplate - fxpreview when done drawing / splash-screen support on top; while drawing.\n- do like 4000 x 4000 images on safari; on an old Iphone 5\n- just 1 index.html now - small file size: \n- the source of the 'cleaned-up' version is now 34b (not minified, and still comments in the source; can be even smaller)\n- direct control of the RGB buffer; every pixel.\n- I added some basic routines, like drawing points, lines, squares, sprite-brushes, filters, and my pixel-font\n- draw, add-mix or subtract - manipulate every pixel how you wish\n- I work with a big off-screen kind of image; a rgb-buffer; so drawing goes 'mucho' faster and render it to a screen-scaled image.\n- no other libraries used\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nMouse-click switches between:\n- screen scaled image\n- The large image \n\n- The work will refresh and restart after some time\n\nSave image - with s-key \n(includes the fxhash key-seed and num# of the follow-up images)\n--- It can take some seconds before the saving happens; \n--- the browser has to handle (very) large MB .png files first \n--- before it can save them \n\n- splash image support - to hide drawing at start\n- redraw the image after a while; or not.\n- mouse position check for the bigger image\n- fps counter for testing etc.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nwritten in vanilla JavaScript, more info in the source-code\n\n\ndrawz - latest or an updated version can be found at.\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\nIt would be nice; to include more routines into it\nin the future.\n\nAnd instead of 1 big library with everything in it\nI would like to have these templates; \nwhere you can add different little snippets and routines \nthat you want to use into it, and start playing next.\nStill learning new things as well. And getting inspired.\n\nI don't mind people to use the tech-source as a start for their own projects. \n\nBut the palette, and composition & structure build-up; is mine. \nDon't change just 1 or 2 -things then re-release it.\n\nIf you want to release something of your own,\nyour sketch and generative work; really should look total different!\nYou can use the technics to draw new things,\nbut you have to start from scratch again; \nchoosing points, lines etc. to play with and go from there.\nEnjoy! \n\n\n-for the love of Art and jumping in rain puddles-\n\n'like jimi and guitar'  0__.  ^____^\n\n\nxxx  amsterdam  chillout\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n",

She had always been drawn to the vibrant, lively energy of colorful compositions, and she decided to see what she could create using the rough.js library to add colorful shadows to her rectangles.\n\nAlice began by defining a few simple parameters for her design, such as the size and position of the rectangles and the intensity and hue of the shadows. She then spent hours playing with different combinations of colors and shadow effects, trying to find the perfect balance between vibrancy and harmony.\n\nAs she worked, Alice found herself getting lost in the process, completely absorbed in the world of generative art. She loved the way the rectangles seemed to come to life on the screen, their shadows shifting and changing as she played with the parameters.\n\nEventually, after much experimentation and creativity, Alice hit upon a beautiful and dynamic composition that she felt was truly special. She saved her work and sat back to admire it, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over her.\n\nAnd so, with her passion for art and color driving her forward, Alice had created yet another stunning piece of generative art, using the rough.js library to bring her vision to life.\n\nIn live mode Press \"s\" to save image (2200 x 3030).\n\n+---+\nThe Magic of Color and Light by __Reiji_c\n+---+\nMade with vanilla javascript + (roughjs MIT License (c) Preet Shihn)",

            "description": "As Alice continued to explore the world of generative art, she became more and more interested in the ways that color and light could be used to enhance her designs. She had always been drawn to the vibrant, lively energy of colorful compositions, and she decided to see what she could create using the rough.js library to add colorful shadows to her rectangles.\n\nAlice began by defining a few simple parameters for her design, such as the size and position of the rectangles and the intensity and hue of the shadows. She then spent hours playing with different combinations of colors and shadow effects, trying to find the perfect balance between vibrancy and harmony.\n\nAs she worked, Alice found herself getting lost in the process, completely absorbed in the world of generative art. She loved the way the rectangles seemed to come to life on the screen, their shadows shifting and changing as she played with the parameters.\n\nEventually, after much experimentation and creativity, Alice hit upon a beautiful and dynamic composition that she felt was truly special. She saved her work and sat back to admire it, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over her.\n\nAnd so, with her passion for art and color driving her forward, Alice had created yet another stunning piece of generative art, using the rough.js library to bring her vision to life.\n\nIn live mode Press \"s\" to save image (2200 x 3030).\n\n+---+\nThe Magic of Color and Light by __Reiji_c\n+---+\nMade with vanilla javascript + (roughjs MIT License (c) Preet Shihn)",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution. I tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge / Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iPhone, but please make sure it works on your device before minting.\n\n-----\n\nPossible features:\n\ncolor scheme: cairngorm, alborz, bardenas, atlas, bieszczady, watkins\n\nproportions: square, wide, standard, narrow\n\nframe: none, vignette, bright, dark, bright with vignette, dark with vignette\n\nvisitors: tourists, tourists and birds, solitary flock of birds, only light\n",
