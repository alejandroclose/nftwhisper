Collectors should still look closely and choose what they like when buying on secondary.\n\nWhich team are you on? X or O?\n\nfollow culla on twitter for updates. Or maybe __acolyte__\n\nIf the non reserved tokens mint out quickly, Access List mints will have 24 hours to mint reserves assigned to those wallets\n\nThank you for supporting an emerging artist in the generative art space\n\nAccess List reserves were given to holders of the following PFP collections created by culla\n2x for each Basqunk held\n1x for each Inkspunk, TwoFourQunk, V0iD, DeeManz, Punkasso and CR0$$KULL\nYou would have needed to transfer the above tokens to your mint wallet at the time of the snapshot\n\nshare your tokens on social media with #genxyznft\nMade with love by culla using p5.js",
