            "description": "Primarily, I use lines to create images or designs. It is characterized by simplicity and minimalism, and I focused on using clean and precise lines to convey shapes, forms, and textures. Also emphasized outlines, color palettes, and subject lines rather than shadows to create a more substantial visual impact.\nI expressed this idea through lines with simplicity and clarity to leave room for interpretation by the viewer. One of the advantages of line art is its versatility. I combined lines with geometric shapes to add depth and texture to the image. \nOverall, I tried to offer a unique way of expressing creativity by focusing on clean lines and minimal aesthetics, and I believe that lines can have an eternal charm that will continue to captivate audiences in various artistic media such as digital art.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "\"Year\" is a mere four-letter word. But in reality, much has occurred. There are 12 months or approximately 365 days in a year. I joined fxhash about 4 months ago. And a lot has happened in my life since then. Can you imagine what happened to the people who founded, participated in, and maintained fxhash from its founding days? Everyday must've been different, and each day has its own pattern and color.\n\nI've felt as if I lived in two different worlds since joining fxhash. I'm an architect by day, and a creator by night. I'm a part of fxhash, and I believe every single one of us experiences it that way. Each day has its own pattern and color.\n\nThis piece is my way of imagining what this community has gone through in a year. Each block represents a month from November 2021 to October 2022, with every block consists of smaller blocks that represents a day. Each of these days have their own colors and patterns. Every day tells its own story. But when you imagine a bigger picture of what happened in a year, you will see a specific pattern and color that you can keep as one big composition, and that gives you a year full of stories to admire.\n\nI try to participate in the anniversary event as a way of expressing my gratitude. For everyone who has helped build this community so vibrant and meaningful - you have created such a world, and subsequently made my year. And therefore to me, you are all wonderful souls. So many artists, collectors, coders, art enthusiasts, and all of fxhash's teams have inspired me. Don't stop creating awesome stuff. Happy Birthday fxhash!!",

            "description": "🟦🟥🟦🟦 My First Pure javascript Generative art 🟦🟥🟦🟦\n\n\nI am a computer hardware engineering graduate about 24 years ago. I am also an Artist for more than 35 years.\n\nDue to my interest in art, I worked on 3D animation first, then as an animation director, and finally as a TV advertisement producer and director (for more than 25 years because from the middle of university, I was my own animation and VFX company) and I did less programming.\nProgramming was still a part of my life but mostly for simplifying repetitive tasks or adding functionality to the software I was working on like 3Dmax - Photoshop or After Effects.\nThe FXhash event inspired me to rekindle my passion for programming and write my first complete program from scratch in pure JavaScript without relying on any external libraries.\nI used my artistic background to create a visually appealing product. My previous Artworks was either supporting my own community or image compositing.\nI tried to make this Generative art, Artify, in the style of my pixel art as well.\nI will definitely write an article about the Morixels lands.\nI hope you enjoy this accidental artwork as much as I do, and transfer it to your own wallet. If your first creation doesn't turn out as expected, you can always try again.\nI will lower the price of my Collections so I can collaborate with you dear collectors and in this way we can make a profit together. \n\nTo create balance, these NFTs are randomly minted, and this is a chance for everyone to get a rare version. So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nDesigned by: @morteza_yousefy\nMade in 2023",

It is characterized by simplicity and minimalism, and I focused on using clean and precise lines to convey shapes, forms, and textures. Also emphasized outlines, color palettes, and subject lines rather than shadows to create a more substantial visual impact.\nI expressed this idea through lines with simplicity and clarity to leave room for interpretation by the viewer. One of the advantages of line art is its versatility. I combined lines with geometric shapes to add depth and texture to the image. \nOverall, I tried to offer a unique way of expressing creativity by focusing on clean lines and minimal aesthetics, and I believe that lines can have an eternal charm that will continue to captivate audiences in various artistic media such as digital art.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "Snake Alley is a place in my neighborhood where the sidewalk is narrowly bounded by low-hanging branches on one side and a steep ditch one the other. I have seen countless snakes dart across the sidewalk there at dusk. \n\nI always wind up at Snake Alley, wearing sandals, at dusk.\n\nThis generative system creates unique outputs for each hash. The compositions are organized like spokes through a series of concentric rings, like the Dharmachakra, however these are twisted and centered around an out-spiraling function. Higher-torque versions look more twisted and gnarled, while low-torque versions look like rays emanating from the center.\n\nA number of branches connect each outer ring with its adjacent, inner ring. The layers of branches fill the space with low, medium, or high density - full of circles drawn from the outer layers to the innermost layer. The circles themselves are small or large, within each output.\n\nFifteen color palettes named after different kinds of snakes were used to lightly color the edges, each drawn with equal likelihood. The titles and colors were adapted from different snake species, typically variants found in the southeastern US, when different colorations occur in other regions. The coral, corn, and milk snakes around Charleston have similar coloration in nature, and their similar color gradients reflect this fact.\n\nI originally composed this artwork in the R Statistics language. I translated the system to p5.js for the one-year anniversary of fxhash. Proceeds from sales will go to Processing.org, the organization that is developing p5.js. #fxhashturnsone \n\nVerified NFT collectors can purchase a fine art print for their unique token at vadenart.com\n\nAbout the artist: Kenny Vaden is a generative artist based in Charleston, SC. His art experience included drawing, painting, stained glass apprenticeships, and nature photography. Vaden’s code-based artworks are available online as limited edition or single edition fine art prints, as well as NFTs on Quantum.art, Flamingo DAO Flutter, OpenSea, Objkt, fxhash, and Foundation.

If you're lucky enough to have laser eyes, you have a QT protecting you. There are several gift hearts and diamonds around you that you can pick up(There is no doubt that you will use them somewhere.). Your QTs bring nouns and behavioral adjectives with them. In the gift that's going around the platform, you'll find it.\n\nA total of thirty rare groups are considered for QTs, making them unique among PFPs and allowing you to have diverse and exclusive QTs.\n\n🔷QT is not just an NFT. To make significant events more enjoyable, QT is with you. All you need to do is own QTs and follow them. You will be surprised by QTs. 1011 girls and 1011 boys will mint in the first series of QTs in 2022. At the opening of the 2022 World Cup, the first QT Boy pieces were minted.\n\n🤝Saleh.C4d and  ArashMP collaborated on QT.\n\n✅ you can save the image in the following sizes:\n\n⌨️ Key number 1️⃣ 1080 pixels\n\n⌨️ Key number 2️⃣ 216  pixels\n\n\n📃 License: (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)\n\n🅿️5️⃣ Built with p5js\n\n📅 November 2022",

            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac.

            "description": "An ancient civilization had conquered the stars, building huge monoliths to harness their energy. These mega structures now lie in decay, as their lights begin to dim. What happened to these civilizations? We may never know. We can only bear witness to their ends.\n\nThe code for \"Dying of the Lights\" explores the effect of heredity on structure and color. The base data structure is a quadtree in which child nodes inherit properties from its parent. The evolution of each node depends on the structure of the paren, and not all nodes will survive. The structure is then exploded into their final resting place as they slowly orbit the star.\n\nThe piece can be animated by hitting \"Space\" to slowly watch the Dying of the Light. Performance of the animation depends on the complexity of each piece, and the technical specifications of the device.\n\nThe viewer can also control the frame depth and color of the final display, as well as show / hide several additional easter eggs in the details.\n\nControls:\n[UP / DOWN] - Adjust frame depth\n[LEFT / RIGHT] - Adjust frame color\n[D] - Show / hide details\n[SPACE] - Animate\n\n*Higher resolution images can be generated by adding &x=[width]&y=[height] behind the url. Larger images may not be rendered well on devices with less memory.\n\nCommon sizes at 300dpi: \nA4 = 2490 x 3510\nLetter = 2550 x 3300\n\nLICENSE: \nThis code is licensed under CC-BY-SA-NC 3.0 \n\nNOTICE:\nThis code makes use of the XORSHIFT prng algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift)\nIt also uses the Roboto Slab font from Google fonts (Apache 2.0: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\nAlso, much thanks to thecodingtrain for their quadtree tutorial\n",
