            "description": "Fabric. A collection of swatches. \n\nThis is a project of stacked PNGs producing fabric swatches. Some are almost plaids, others are more batik, while others are more of a \"magic eye\" or optical illusion look. \n\nThe PNGs were generated using VBA and conditional formatting in MS Excel, then copy/pasted as an image into MS PowerPoint, and occasionally further manipulated in different image editors including MS Paint. Images were batch resized to match each other at 1125x1125.\n\nThere are a lot of options for this collection. The layers and total number of options per (included \"none\" layers):\n- Base\n    - 42\n- Flecking \n    - 18\n- Broad\n    - 50\n- Underpin\n    - 43\n- Warp\n    - 21\n- Weft\n    - 26\n- Overpins\n    - 43\n- Mask\n    - 21\n- Texture\n    - 14\n\n\nThere is a slight potential to mint the \"imaginary fabric\", one which is comprised of only \"none\" layers. That is the best of the bunch, because it is only limited by your imagination. Consider it the legendary.\n\nThere should be an interplay between the coded elements of each individual PNG and the overall stack. The randomness of coded layers stacked with other, dissimilar (base) coded layers generates interesting, and at times, colorful patterns that don't have a singular, obvious, overarching algo.\n\nHope you enjoy! \n\nStacking achieved using PureSpider's pfp code https://github.com/PureSpider/fxhash-pfp\n\nLicense CC BY-SA 4.0",

It doesn't matter, you did it right. Your accomplishments will serve well the next generations in their journeys, in their search for themselves.\n\nNow it's time to stop, time to take a moment and contemplate the vast universe.\n\nSoon all of this will be ending.\n\nYou did it right.\n\nEmbrace the void.\n=========\n=========\n\n\n./ Color scheme (feature)\nThere are 12 color schemes and with each set, specific arrays for color collections for the space, stars, planet, and accent colors. \n\nThese are color schemes in the known universe of \"In the Edge\":\n- Mars visions\n- Cyberpunk\n- Unknown passenger \n- Renegade\n- Primary\n- Coral\n- r.e.d.\n- Machines of an ancient-future \n- The void\n- Tinted light \n- Malibu dreams\n- Atari (horrendous brown, red and yellowish combinations... I love it)\n\n./ Mountain type (feature)\nIn the Edge, you will find a mountain, and that mountain will be special, which type will you find?\n\n- Parallela insolitum\n- Sandy dunes of the truth\n- Wavy uncertainty\n- Intrinsic soul ridges\n- Cerritulus formationis\n\n./ Mountain direction (feature)\nLife is about direction... mountains too.\n\n- Left\n- Right\n- Left-Right\n\n./ Space scenery\nThis is the spicy touch, some of the iterations will have animation and others will not, giving you a clear view of the magnificent space in front of you.\n\n- Clean (NOT animated)\n- Windy planet (animated)\n- Topographic planet (animated)\n- Meteor shower (animated)\n\n./ Distance from Earth (feature)\nHow far did you go?

Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n—--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n—--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n—--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022.

            "description": "The first blueprint was found in 1947 on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.\nIt has been studied several times.\nNumerous theories arose trying to explain its origin.\nNone of them was decided conclusively.\n\nOne year ago, a rare group of waves coming from space was intercepted on earth.\nThis happened during the 2021 summer.\nIt was unclear if they were born from natural events.\nDying stars, black holes... Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n—--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n—--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n—--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022. Madrid - Cadiz. Spain.\nMade with p5.js",
