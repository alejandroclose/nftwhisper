            "description": "Adjacent is the third in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art. This piece focuses on the study of Diagonal White, a series he developed between 1970 and 1975.\n\nIn 1976, Ruth Leavitt published a collection of papers titled \"Artist & Computer\", which highlighted the 35 prominent generative artists and asked them to discuss their work. They were posed questions like, \"Do you feel art work created with a computer has now or will have an impact on art as a whole in the future?\". Edward Zajec was a subject of one of those papers and in it detailed the approach to Diagonal White. \n\nThe original program was run on a CDC 6200 computer at The Univeresiry of Trieste. The programming was done in collaboration with Dr. Matjaz Hmeljak, his long-time technical partner. Inspired by his collaborative relationship, Adjacent the output of a partnership between Christine Hall and Chris Maddern.\n\nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to save a high-resolution version of the image\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nBy @christine_hall and @chrismaddern",

            "description": "Henge is an exploration of circular megalithic structures of the prehistoric age. It is a work of historical fiction where these stone assemblies, achieved through herculean efforts of stacking, aligning, and balancing immense chiseled rocks, are reimagined within an alternate universe of algorithmic possibility. Historically, henges share a few qualities that inspired this project. First, they are places of gathering within a loose collection of stones to organize ceremony or worship under celestial alignments. They are also monolithic in their materiality and employ the most elemental techniques of megalithic, or large stone, construction. These particular types of henges, known as cromlechs, are circular spaces fit with purpose and ritual and in this sense, serve as precedents to the great human edifices; charging landscapes with meaning and presence through geometry and order. Finally, henges are a collective language of place-making shared across a range of cultures and ages, from the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras and across territories from modern-day Morocco, Portugal, Brazil, Germany, Scandinavia, to the well-known Stonehenge in Great Britain.\n\nThis project is deeply inspired by the timeless and universal narrative created through the thoughtful and deliberate placement of large rocks in a circle. It seems that when confronted with marking a place and communing with nature, human beings like to make circles out of stones. Among all the symbols of place making, the circle is the original and still remains the most universal. Through the use of code to portray these imperfect structures, Henge animates the history of these circles in all their roughness and seemingly endless variation.\n\n\n--------\n\nCreated by Aranda\\Lasch @ArandaLasch\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\nNovember 2022\n\n[Interaction instructions]\n'left' + 'right' arrow keys to change view\n'i' saves a 2048x2048 PNG\n\n[Info]\np5.js\nHenge is optimized for Chrome, runs slowly on Firefox (the longer the wait, the more stones and/or grass are being generated)\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n10% of all primary and secondary proceeds donated directly to Girls Who Code\n",

            "description": "This project is borne out of my longstanding fascination with brushwork, and the intricate textures that can be created with a brush, some paint and a canvas. Brush strokes are simulated using many overlapping lines and given texture and depth using a custom shader. Another important aspect of this work, is the composite forms that are created by the brush strokes, which are my attempt to emulate the emphatic energy of many abstract painters that have come before me. Color palettes are named after common paint colors, based on the background color used for the palette.\n\nThose who collect during the first tier of the Dutch Auction can claim a signed print. They will be printed on A3 Hahnemuhle Photo Rag, and shipped to the collector free of charge.

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.

From there, I specifically developed it with non-plotter printing in mind, and more specific still, Riso Printing (think a scanner with a digital screen-printer MacGyver’d on). The palettes are taken from hex-estimated Risograph colour gamuts, with three layers being multiplied together to replicate, to some degree, the blending of the semi-transparent Risographic inks. Within this study, there’s a few different things going on, the initial setup is rectangles which cascade down the canvas, inheriting more extreme rotation as they get closer to the bottom (a la Schotter). The second is a subdivision of the shapes with filled circled, outlined circles and squares — since in this study the base shapes are rectangles and not squares, distribution of the ‘dithering’ can be larger than a single ‘pixel’ size — when these multiple layers overlap, the shapes produce a halftone-moire effect, forms and structures appear from the noise as the underlying patterns intersect. \n\ntx: Who?, Cosimo, Liam Egan, Andreas Rau, Louis\n\nLicensing: CC-BY-NC-ND ",

            "description": "As we each grapple with artificial intelligence (love it or hate it), it’s a technological advance that is here to stay and we must all wrestle with what makes it different from us humans. Both humans and AI learn and transform through others - might our experiences just be very complex training models? \n\n“ReAssembled” reflects on the truth that we are all constantly evolving and growing through the visual metaphor of Frankenstein’s creation. However, this process of growth is not unique to humans nor reanimated life. \n\nAI also learns and transforms through the data that it processes. The portraits in this project are a visual representation of this idea. They are a product of AI's ability to learn, grow and reassemble data, just as we humans do with our own experiences.\n\nThe project was created with the conception, design, and digital painting (by a human), with portraits generated by AI and layers all stitched together using the magic of code written by another human. \n\nThe title \"ReAssembled\" references the process of creating the final image and the dark assemblage of Victor Frankenstein’s creation, but it also speaks to the idea of reassembling our own identities, and how our experiences shape us. \n\nI hope that this project sparks reflection on the complexity of the human experience and the inseparable role that technology plays in it.\n\n~~~~~\n-Minters get 4% royalty\n-Collectors of The Modern Prometheus get a 24hr reserve\n-33% of primary goes to Tezos for Iran, supporting women’s rights in Iran.\n\nTrait list:\n9 faces with equal rarity in each quadrant\n13 “scars” of varying rarity\n7 mouths of varying rarity\n11 eyes of varying rarity\n\nSpecial Trait:\n“Crowned” scar trait will get 3 free mints of my next Fx Hash project.\n\n6.5 million potential variations\n\n~~~\nSpecial thanks to PureSpider for his template.",

Through this artwork, I attempt to visually represent the complex and often overwhelming emotions that I experience on a daily basis. It is a reflection of the cyclical nature of my thoughts and feelings, and the ways in which I try to make sense of them. But as I delve deeper into my own personal experiences, I realize that in the end, internal chaos should not be controlled, but accepted.\n\nThis artwork is my most personal, as it reflects my innermost sensations. It is a reminder to myself and to others that it is okay to not have everything under control, and that it is important to allow the uncertainty and unpredictability of life. I hope that it will resonate with others and provide a sense of connection and understanding. It is a reminder that we are not alone in our struggles and that it is important to embrace our own imperfections.\n\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.

After many unsuccessful attempts to get rid of them, usually foiled by the clever Majestic Creatures in elaborate ways, Nocturna cast a powerful spell upon them. This spell was extremely effective and made the Majestic Creatures plummet, with great speed, into the ground leaving only their tails to show.\n\nThe creatures then turned their energy to nature, and joined as one to become a deity of the natural world. They rise, and protect creatures from harm, especially during the night.\n\nThe reeds (tails) are held as sacred, and believed to have healing powers.\n\nI have created this graphical study of the tails (exotic reeds) for your informational requirements and ocular interest.\n\n128 images are planned to follow henceforth, subject to available minters.\"\n\ns will save a 4000x4000 jpg of the image. \ng will convert to gray.\nc will convert back to color.\nm will save a 4000x4000 monochrome jpg of the image.\n\nCoded in P5.js\n\n\n",

From there, I specifically developed it with non-plotter printing in mind, and more specific still, Riso Printing (think a scanner with a digital screen-printer MacGyver’d on). The palettes are taken from hex-estimated Risograph colour gamuts, with three layers being multiplied together to replicate, to some degree, the blending of the semi-transparent Risographic inks. Within this study, there’s a few different things going on, the initial setup is rectangles which cascade down the canvas, inheriting more extreme rotation as they get closer to the bottom (a la Schotter). The second is a subdivision of the shapes with filled circled, outlined circles and squares — since in this study the base shapes are rectangles and not squares, distribution of the ‘dithering’ can be larger than a single ‘pixel’ size — when these multiple layers overlap, the shapes produce a halftone-moire effect, forms and structures appear from the noise as the underlying patterns intersect. \n\ntx: Who?, Cosimo, Liam Egan, Andreas Rau, Louis\n\nLicensing: CC-BY-NC-ND ",

Also, minters get a share in future royalties of their mints, which may be cool in any reality where they become popular one day.\n\nI'll probably reference these guys on other relevant art I produce, when it seems appropriate.\n\nCoded in p5js.",

            "description": "\"The Valley\" is a unique collection of generative art that explores the mysterious and enigmatic valleys on distant planets. Using algorithms, each piece captures the beauty and mood of the different valleys, some of which are more friendly and inviting, while others are bleak and ominous. The unpredictable and abstract nature of the art invites the viewer to see the beauty in the unknown and to be fascinated by the infinite possibilities of the universe. The glitches and digital distortions add an element of unpredictability, enhancing the sense of mystery and intrigue and inviting the viewer to be fully immersed in the art.\n\nThe art is inspired by the aesthetic of old sci-fi magazine covers, with a modern twist that pushes the boundaries of contemporary art. Each piece is a visual representation of the imagination and a tribute to the beauty and fascination of the unknown. Through this collection, the viewer is invited to experience the unknown in a captivating and thought-provoking way. The art invites the viewer to ponder the mysteries of the universe and to be inspired by the beauty of the unknown. This collection is a celebration of the imagination and a testament to the power of generative art to explore the unknown and bring it to life.\n\nGenuary 2023: Landscapes",
