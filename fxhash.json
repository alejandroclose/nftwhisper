            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

            "description": "🔥 BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY \"open edition\" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",
