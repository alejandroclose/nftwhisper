            "description": "‘a reveure!’ is a catalan farewell expression. this collection is a souvenir to celebrate me meeting up with artists, collectors and friends during 2023’s summer art events (Responsive Dreams in Barcelona and NFT Show Europe in Valencia). \nmechanics to get a piece: say ‘hi’ and chat with me to get a free pass to mint your iteration and its signed miniprint. i’ll be doing mobile live minting on small screen (iPad/phone) during Barcelona and Valencia events. \n\n‘a reveure!’ is about simplifying my painting brushes style used in previous works, in an attempt to find minimalist and more conceptual approach. using only black and white and minimizing the use of random, i explore the void and the spaces generated on the canvas, discovering how abstract sculpture-like figures emerge. raw edges and big brushes make the eye confused as it seems 3D shapes building up. \n\nthis line of work and the concept behind it was inspired by Elena Asins’ computer art from late XX’s century.\n\nthe motion restarts every 20sec\npress [s] or click/touch to save an image\npress [r] to reload \npress [1] - [9] to make higher resolution\npress [c] to make brushes spin\npress left/right arrows to move brushes left/right\n\nmade with love and p5js\n\nthank you fxhash team to give me the opportunity and tools to do this special mobile live minting\n\nMarc L Clapers / mekhno\nsummer 2023",

The compositions can be chaotic and maybe even a little messy, but they also can be vibrant and diverse… which is really what this is trying to celebrate: diversity and expression.\n\nSimply, it’s about the emotions associated with whatever frees you.\n\nPlease see the linked fxtext article (on the main project page) for a more in-depth dissection of the concept. It’s less of a technical discussion, and more about the experience of the artist, and how it became linked with the feelings they associate with the art.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nFor higher resolutions, you can append “&density=2” to the url to double the size, “&density=3” to triple, and so on.\n(This is highly recommended.)\n\nTo adjust grain, you can append “&grain=##” to the url. 40 is the default, and 0 will remove it completely.",
