Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "\"◉◉◉\" presents a collection of pointillistic drawings generated by p5js. However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.\n\"◉◉◉\" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.\n\nThe technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\"Swarmachine\" is the closest thing to a useless machine that actually works. \nIn this dichotomy, a swarm of sensitive automatons can be seen carrying out complex cooperative work of misunderstood utility. From a strange coordination, the micro-square society builds its habitat. Influenced by each other, they relate from a sonorous dance. And this is how the swarm lives and reveals -finally- the essence of its own machinery: vestiges and ephemeral moments before leaving.\n\n4 main audiovisual gestures of sonorous dance:\n1. Basic loop\nEach square performs quadrangle movements. It begins and ends at the same point accompanied by a sound.\n2. Contact moment\nAppears when a square reaches a corner of its path and makes contact with another square.\n3. Gesture kamikaze-release\nSometimes these \"contact moments\" result in an impact between the two squares in question, transforming both into a single gesture of fusion, and subsequent release of the swarm.\n4. Queen loop\nAppears when the queen is sighted. Main square that keeps the essence of the machinery.\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js. All sounds are synths programmed in the tone.js library.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "This project began as an exploration of how human beings across all sorts of cultures respond in remarkably similar ways in terms of associating sounds with shapes.  That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.

However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.\n\"◉◉◉\" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.\n\nThe technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

            "description": "\"◉◉◉\" presents a collection of pointillistic drawings generated by p5js. However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.\n\"◉◉◉\" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.\n\nThe technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

            "description": "This project began as an exploration of how human beings across all sorts of cultures respond in remarkably similar ways in terms of associating sounds with shapes.  That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",
