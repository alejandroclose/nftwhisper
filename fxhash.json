            "description": "Uninhabitable is a generative system built only from ellipses. The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state. Press \"h\" to save it.\n\nUninhabitable is an original work by Iskra Velitchkova. 2021.",

Said shapes can also be rotated and interleaved with empty squares.\nThe use of each one of the forms follows three different combination patterns, according to the description and percentages of occurrence indicated below:\n“+++” – 50% | full square + triangle\n“++” – 35% | rectangle + triangle\n“+” – 15% | just triangle\n\nINVERSÉ\nOne of the rare features, with only a 10% probability, is the occurrence of the inverted color palette, in which the colors of the background, simple shapes and frame, are put in negative.\n\nVECTEUR\nThe background was structured following two possible direction vectors (horizontal – 40% or vertical – 60%).\n\nMODULES\nThe canvas can be subdivided following three different modulations, which can be 3X3 (20% chance), 4X4 (45% chance) or 5X5 (35% chance).\n\nSeptember 01, 2022.\nGenerative token by Paivei made with p5js for FxHash.\n",

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "'Here When You Need Me' is a generative system that creates...\n\nGood question, and I think the answer is up to you. Jewels? Reflections? The Sand in a Life's Hourglass?\n\nWho knows. The truth is that I didn't have anything in mind for the project, and where it has ended up was purely through exploration, and a refinement of simple methods.\n\nBy the end, it has become exactly what I needed it to be, and the results of this project give me an encouragement that is difficult to explain.\n\nNow, one of the primary features of the project is your ability to make it what you need. Several URL arguments are explained below that will allow you to tweak your edition's distortion and resolution.\n\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Girls Who Code'\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n\n10% of royalties will go to 'Girls Who Code'\n10% of royalties will go to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n10% of royalties will go to the original minter\n\nThank you everyone.\n\n\nOptions\n-------\nParameters can be appended to the live URL to adjust the output's distortion, resolution, border size, and border color. These are all fun to play with, and can be used in combination to showcase the variability and potential of each piece.\n\n'&distortion=#': Adjust distortion, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 to see a 'flat' version of the image)\n'&resolution=#': Multiplier for width/height, any value from 0.1 to 6.0 (Soft max of 3.9)\n'&borderSize=#': Multiplier for border size, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 for no border)\n'&borderColor=ffffff': Custom border color, any 6 character hex code (Do not include '#')\n\nAn example of using multiple options would be '&resolution=2&distortion=.5'\n\nPlease check the linked fx(text) article for detailed examples on using these options.\n\n\nDistortion\n----------\nI wanted to provide some amount of control to take advantage of the possibilities of generative art. 'Here When You Need Me' starts off at a certain point, but allows you to adjust the distortion to your favorite level.\n\nUsing '&distortion=0' will show the underlying shapes.\n\n\nResolution / Printing\n---------------------\n'Here When You Need Me' looks best with at least '&resolution=2' and is designed to support printing. Remember that parameters can be provided to adjust the border attributes as well.\n\nIdeally, you should aim for 300 'pixels per inch' for a decent quality print. Default resolution is 1800x2400.\n\n'&resolution=1' -> 6\"x8\"\n'&resolution=2' -> 12\"x16\"\n\nSome quick math will give you the correct modifier if you start with the width in inches of your desired print. \n\n(inches) * (ppi) / (default width)\n\nAn important note, the maximum resolution modifier I've had success with is 3.9 because of the browser's image size limitations, but the capability is still in the code to go higher in case it is helpful to someone.\n\nIf you have your edition printed, please share with me because it would make me incredibly happy to see it!\n\n\n---------\nThank you to everyone for your support and contributions. \n\nI put way more detail in this description than I intended, but if you want even more, you can read about the development and potential of this project in the accompanying fx(text) article, once it is written.\n\nCreated by Walter Anderson (@noxiarb)",

            "description": "Adjacent is the third in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art. This piece focuses on the study of Diagonal White, a series he developed between 1970 and 1975.\n\nIn 1976, Ruth Leavitt published a collection of papers titled \"Artist & Computer\", which highlighted the 35 prominent generative artists and asked them to discuss their work. They were posed questions like, \"Do you feel art work created with a computer has now or will have an impact on art as a whole in the future?\". Edward Zajec was a subject of one of those papers and in it detailed the approach to Diagonal White. \n\nThe original program was run on a CDC 6200 computer at The Univeresiry of Trieste. The programming was done in collaboration with Dr. Matjaz Hmeljak, his long-time technical partner. Inspired by his collaborative relationship, Adjacent the output of a partnership between Christine Hall and Chris Maddern.\n\nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to save a high-resolution version of the image\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nBy @christine_hall and @chrismaddern",

            "description": "In the dreamlike landscape of our minds, the specter of fears is like a wraith, ever-present and ethereal. It whispers in our ear, reminding us of all the things we dare not face. It is a shadow that falls across our hearts, casting a pall of doubt and uncertainty. But even as it haunts us, we must remember that it is a part of us. We must learn to accept its presence, and to use it to our advantage. For fear is not always a curse, it is a guide that shows us where we must grow stronger. It is a companion that walks with us through the dark night, illuminating the path ahead. By embracing our fears, we find the courage to face them, and to overcome them. We find the strength to live fully, to love fiercely, and to pursue our dreams with abandon.\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nSpecter of Fears by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2023\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "Cellular automata is fascinating :) Applications ranging from physics and biology to modeling and architecture, with artistic and aesthetic representation always following along. Perfect example for emergence, how simple even byte-size rules result in complex structures, forming patterns and unpredictable behaviors...\n\nThis one is simple, 1d elementary cellular automata and the 256 rules as the foundation, where each iteration consists of the following elements: base rules - 3 are selected and allocated into the start row compositions, a set of shapes is assigned to a grid of various sizes. Occasionally, dynamic rule set is added - where a rule is randomly transformed into another random rule on a random row of the grid. A vertical or horizontal alignment of the grid is chosen an a color set assigned. Sometimes, a simple 2d noise is applied to lighten (or well, darken) things a bit. The grid is finite and confined by the amount of cells in a row and amount of rows fitting the canvas given cell size.\n\nThe properties are recorded as features, more as a reference to the building blocks, rather then rarity indication. Probably be best viewed in live mode :)\n\nPressing 's' in live mode will save the png of the output.",

These plants, and the hills they inhabit, have long been a source of beauty and adventure in my life, and I find myself repeatedly drawn back to them. The sunsets in coastal California are a perfect compliment to these hills, and I set out to represent that combination in this work.\n\nEach iteration of this algorithm feels, to me, like a glimpse out of a car window on a drive up the coast, a pause on a cool morning hike, or a memory of tearing through sharp underbrush with good company.\n\nStylistically and texturally, I drew from landscapes rendered in oil pastels, placing thousands of tiny circles, alluding to the effect of depositing particles of color onto paper. \n\nI hope that this work evokes in the viewer the feelings of peace, wildness, and adventure that I feel when I watch the sun set over these hills.\n\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\nNotes:\n- Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.",

This piece focuses on the study of Diagonal White, a series he developed between 1970 and 1975.\n\nIn 1976, Ruth Leavitt published a collection of papers titled \"Artist & Computer\", which highlighted the 35 prominent generative artists and asked them to discuss their work. They were posed questions like, \"Do you feel art work created with a computer has now or will have an impact on art as a whole in the future?\". Edward Zajec was a subject of one of those papers and in it detailed the approach to Diagonal White. \n\nThe original program was run on a CDC 6200 computer at The Univeresiry of Trieste. The programming was done in collaboration with Dr. Matjaz Hmeljak, his long-time technical partner. Inspired by his collaborative relationship, Adjacent the output of a partnership between Christine Hall and Chris Maddern.\n\nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to save a high-resolution version of the image\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nBy @christine_hall and @chrismaddern",

            "description": "'Here When You Need Me' is a generative system that creates...\n\nGood question, and I think the answer is up to you. Jewels? Reflections? The Sand in a Life's Hourglass?\n\nWho knows. The truth is that I didn't have anything in mind for the project, and where it has ended up was purely through exploration, and a refinement of simple methods.\n\nBy the end, it has become exactly what I needed it to be, and the results of this project give me an encouragement that is difficult to explain.\n\nNow, one of the primary features of the project is your ability to make it what you need. Several URL arguments are explained below that will allow you to tweak your edition's distortion and resolution.\n\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Girls Who Code'\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n\n10% of royalties will go to 'Girls Who Code'\n10% of royalties will go to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n10% of royalties will go to the original minter\n\nThank you everyone.\n\n\nOptions\n-------\nParameters can be appended to the live URL to adjust the output's distortion, resolution, border size, and border color. These are all fun to play with, and can be used in combination to showcase the variability and potential of each piece.\n\n'&distortion=#': Adjust distortion, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 to see a 'flat' version of the image)\n'&resolution=#': Multiplier for width/height, any value from 0.1 to 6.0 (Soft max of 3.9)\n'&borderSize=#': Multiplier for border size, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 for no border)\n'&borderColor=ffffff': Custom border color, any 6 character hex code (Do not include '#')\n\nAn example of using multiple options would be '&resolution=2&distortion=.5'\n\nPlease check the linked fx(text) article for detailed examples on using these options.\n\n\nDistortion\n----------\nI wanted to provide some amount of control to take advantage of the possibilities of generative art. 'Here When You Need Me' starts off at a certain point, but allows you to adjust the distortion to your favorite level.\n\nUsing '&distortion=0' will show the underlying shapes.\n\n\nResolution / Printing\n---------------------\n'Here When You Need Me' looks best with at least '&resolution=2' and is designed to support printing. Remember that parameters can be provided to adjust the border attributes as well.\n\nIdeally, you should aim for 300 'pixels per inch' for a decent quality print. Default resolution is 1800x2400.\n\n'&resolution=1' -> 6\"x8\"\n'&resolution=2' -> 12\"x16\"\n\nSome quick math will give you the correct modifier if you start with the width in inches of your desired print. \n\n(inches) * (ppi) / (default width)\n\nAn important note, the maximum resolution modifier I've had success with is 3.9 because of the browser's image size limitations, but the capability is still in the code to go higher in case it is helpful to someone.\n\nIf you have your edition printed, please share with me because it would make me incredibly happy to see it!\n\n\n---------\nThank you to everyone for your support and contributions. \n\nI put way more detail in this description than I intended, but if you want even more, you can read about the development and potential of this project in the accompanying fx(text) article, once it is written.\n\nCreated by Walter Anderson (@noxiarb)",

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",
