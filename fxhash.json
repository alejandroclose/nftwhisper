            "description": "Cry Diversity is just that - a cry for greater diversity and equality in the genArt community. The UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity beautifully states, “As a source of exchange, innovation and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature.”  Who better to usher in an age of true appreciation for, and active promotion of cultural diversity than a community of artists and collectors.\n\nExcerpts from the UNESCO declaration are embedded in the piece in the form of asemic writing, infusing the piece with the power of the message as it charms the eye.  The collector will also be able to select one of twenty affirmations to be embedded in the work.  Each minted edition will stand as a prayer flag waving permanently on the blockchain spreading its message of belief in a world where we are all valued and respected.  Cry Diversity will be free to collect, but it comes with a challenge.  The collector is expected to actively research the cryptoArt community to find an artist new to them that is a member of an underrepresented group (female, LBGTQIA2+, female identifying, non-binary, POC, global south, etc.).  They are then expected to actively promote that artist and their work for at least one week.  They are expected to personally raise their voice.  Cry Diversity is the second in a series of projects (see the companion piece fx(elevate)) designed to bring attention to individual artists as well as to the value of true commitment to diversity within our community.  It will not be the last.\n\nIt is time to make our cries heard and our actions felt!\n\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint a free edition.  Beginning in the 2nd week, the project will be open to the public for an additional week. Un-minted editions will be burned at the expiration of the 2nd week.\n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Choose your Cry.  Lock it.\n4) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \na) Seed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you have recorded the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the seed to retrieve it.\nb) Cry: What do you want our community to symbolize?  Respect, diversity, compassion?  Choose your favorite characteristic.  It will be baked into your output.\n\nProject Details:\nThis work uses the spectral.js library for the development of color palettes. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in June, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.

            "description": "Let's imagine Crazy Nights, the popular song by paint-clad rockers Kiss. Back in 1987, when hair was high, the song depicts a surreal and fantastical nocturnal adventure, where reality becomes blurred and the line between dreams and waking life is crossed. The lyrics describe peculiar encounters with bizarre characters, strange occurrences, and a surreal atmosphere. This is the land of the strange, where pirate ships sail through the night on unbound and unforseen journeys. This gives the song a whimsical and unpredictable edge, taking us on a peculiar path through one, Kiss-inspired, night.\n\nI give it five stars.",

            "description": "\"Slice of Life\" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",
