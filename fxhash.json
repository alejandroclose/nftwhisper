            "description": "Minima is a study on focus and color. Playing with the idea of a simple composition of semicircles, either rotated up or down. The focus of the observer is moved with the use of gradual animation in the gradients and occasional circles and/or rectangles connecting the shapes together through color.\n\nThe name minima stems from the origins of the composition, mostly taking inspiration from minimalism in its use of a few elements to form a composition greater than the sum of its parts. Less is more, as they say.\n\nThe point at the bottom right of the canvas resembles the end of a sentence. Like reading a book, you process the canvas in a similar way, moving from what pops the most to what the least.\n\nAs the reader of this canvas I hope you observe what happens to your focus as the colors gradually move across the screen. The animations themselves are looping based on a noised sine wave, which gives them imperfections, imperfections you can observe.\n\n----\n\nClick / Tap on the bar at the bottom of the canvas to open up the GUI, used to export your minima into any format you want. Either .png or .svg. Ready for printing, if you desire.\n\nps. there might be a secret keyboard shortcut...\n\n----\n\nMinima,\nWouter Missler, 2022,\np5js + webgl.",

Pressing 'i' will generate a new iteration based on the minted piece. Iteration number can be seen through the console.\n\nThere are two tiers in this Dutch Auction; minters from top tier will be eligible to a free airdrop of their preferred iteration minted on objktcom and transferred to their wallet. Please see my twitter for airdrop details. By doing this i aim to give some curation to minters within randomness.\n\nControls:\n\nPress 'i' to generate new iterations based on the main iteration\nPress 1-4 to export PNG between 1000px t0 4000px\nHold SHIFT and Press 1-4 to export PNG of the iteration 1000px to 4000px\nPress 'r' to reset view back to main iteration\n\nExperimental Export Options:\n\nOpen Console either right click and Inspect or ctrl(cmd) + shift + c\n\nTo export main image in higher resolution type : exportPNG(resolution,fileName)\n\nTo export iterated image in higher resolution type: \n\nexportIteration(iterationNumber,resolution,filename)\n\nwhere resolution is your desired resolution(6000,8000,10000)\nwhere filename is your desired filename. It must be in apostrophe ie \"export8K\"\nwhere iterationNumber is the number of iteration and can be seen on browser console ie 17\n\nExample usage:\n\nexportPNG(8000,\"8kImage\")\nexportIteration(12,8000,\"Iteration8k\")\n\nCreated with p5.js\nMurat Atimtay 2022 | @atimtay | www.muratatimtay.com\n\n\n",

            "description": "Fêlure is a piece picturing our inner selves.\n\nFêlure means a crack in french. It can almost be pronounced as Failure. But not quite.\n\nIt started from a square, that was cracked into many fragments. From outside, it is still a square, stable, reliable. From inside, it is a mess, with many experiences, each one being unique, each one with its own specificity.\n\nEven though we relate to others, there is no definition of normal. No one looks the same. This is why the palettes are all generated and there can be an infinity of them. Some have more darkness than others. Some are warmer, some are cooler. Some are a mix of many things.\n\nOur experiences and our cracks shape us. Sometimes following a natural flow. Sometimes following specific rules. But always guiding us as a whole.\n\n----\n\nThe day I started working on this piece, I realized that I often show myself as chill, ready to give a hand, ready to listen to others. But who am I to help others when I'm not sure about who I am or even what I am?\n\nMaybe that's why I'm able to relate. Because I have my own experiences that cracked me. And built me. So even if I'm a mess, even if I'm not sure about where I'm going, let's share and try to find out together.\n\n----\n\n- The images are meant to be viewed in an horizontal full screen but will adapt to any format\n- Click on the image to restart the animation\n- Hit \"S\" key or long tap on mobile in the live view to trigger an export\n- Add &width=5000 to the live view URL to render the image at 5000 pixels wide\n\n----\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienPradetArt",

            "description": "Inspired and fascinated by Brutalism, Modernism and Bauhaus, I've started to explore the deeper connections of architecture using pixel art in a clean, minimalistic and unique way.\n\nThe BRUTALIST MOVEMENT project represents the next step in this process. It's an animated generative experiment that focuses on finding the simplest and fewest components that - when generated randomly - always create structures resembling buildings: from small modern houses through industrial facilities to gigantic brutalist monuments.\n\nThis resulted in 4 main components: Base, Extension, Gap and Window. These entities are used randomly to create Blocks that form the final structure. \nThe whole process is also strictly accompanied by 4 distinct components to hold colors and to be set by randomly chosen palettes: Sky, Sun, Shadow, Window.\n\nFeatures consist of a mixture of the above components.\n\nThe project is animated to show how the buildings come to life. It's also a nice way to show what's going on in the background, because from time to time a bigger block would surely hide interesting smaller ones :) \n\nPress these keys:\n's' - to download a larger resolution PNG\n'n' - to shuffle through the 'depth' of Blocks, aka placing them from front to back and vice versa. This is a nice feature to show structures hidden by others and also a cool way to create iterations inside the iteration - sub-iterations - we can say :)\n'r' - to reset the Blocks' depths to default\n\nPlease note:\nEverything you see is generated, animated and drawn real-time. No layered transparent PNGs, PFP or similar!\n\nHave fun and inspiration!\n\n\n@cloudnoise © 2022\n\n☁︎\n\nCreated with P5.js library.",

A storm of emotions. A storm of everything. And it's all so fast.\n\nAs are the particles. They're all moving around these cyclones of information. Glowing up like neon signs in a busy city.

Looking especially deep into dynamic grids and dynamic frame rates.\n\nAs for the piece itself, it's a reference to how busy this modern world is. How we're all constantly on the go, whether that is physically, or mentally. Almost feeling like a monsoon. A storm of information. A storm of life. A storm of work. A storm of thoughts. A storm of emotions. A storm of everything. And it's all so fast.\n\nAs are the particles. They're all moving around these cyclones of information. Glowing up like neon signs in a busy city. Moving so fast it's almost a blur. Forming into something greater than the sum of its parts.\n",
