            "description": "'follow my lead' is a visualization of three communities of individuals, and the ways in which they interact with each other.\n\nUsing an implementation of a physarum slime mold model, I create three distinct groups of homogenous individuals, with each group having different sentiments towards the others. Individuals within a community make their best effort to follow each other around, and depending on group preferences try to either move towards or away from those in other groups.\n\nAll of these interactions take place on a simulated three dimensional landscape (that varies by token), with groups of individuals having a preference towards either moving uphill or downhill.\n\nEach group begins with a different spatial distribution, such that the extent of exposure to others can change over time.\n\nFor more details on the slime mold implementation and a link to the github repo containing the code, see the accompanying fx(text) article.\n\n\nAnimation\n---------\nThis is designed first as a static piece. The final image consists of running 300 steps of the algorithm and then stopping.\n\nHowever, I have also exposed a couple of ways to watch the image evolve over time. It should be noted that for some outputs, the image will eventually degenerate as we go well past the initial 300 frames.\n\nKeys:\n- space: Pauses/unpauses the animation\n- 'F': Fresh start - reloads the page and animates the first 300 frames, pausing when finished (or append &fresh=true to the URL)\n- 'A': Animate - reloads the page and animates in perpetuity (or append &animate=true to the URL)\n\nWebGL\n-----\nThis piece makes heavy use of shaders/WebGL. I've put quite a lot of time/effort into trying to ensure things behave identically across different browsers/hardware. I've managed to get things to the point where I was consistently seeing identical outputs on the set of hardware available to me. However, there is still a risk that on other hardware specs, things will not be identical. Furthermore, it is the nature of this project that even very small differences in calculations can become exaggerated after multiple steps of the algorithm, leading to larger differences in the final result.\n\n\nReferences:\nJeff Jones's Physarum paper: https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579\nSage Jensen's post on Physarum, which was my first exposure to it: https://cargocollective.com/sagejenson/physarum\nColor names generated using coloraze: https://github.com/evansque/coloraze",

            "description": "This project began as an exploration of how human beings across all sorts of cultures respond in remarkably similar ways in terms of associating sounds with shapes.  That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",

            "description": "The initial spark for this piece started with Armin Hofmann’s exercises in style and composition. Just as George Nelson wrote in the preface to Armin’s book Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practices: \"Despite all our efforts to simplify things - efforts constantly expanding in order to keep abreast of steadily increasing complexity - nothing is very simple anymore\", these explorations just opened doors to other issues, and further grounded the idea that \"if problems can be correctly stated, they can be solved.\"\n\nArmin suggests we go back to the beginning, to concern ourselves with dots and circles and lines and then bring opposed components in confrontation. \"Confrontation is a theme on which variations can be played with any desired consonances, with any imaginable values, and in a great variety of ways. [...] (Only then) (s)he will be able to find creative solutions to the problems presented by the confrontation of opposites.\"\n\nVery quickly opposed components, even with extending the angle of vision from the two-dimensional surface to the three-dimensional space, and with the contrasts of thin-thick, solid-transparent, softened-hardened line, etc., started looking like I’m weaving complicated plots, visually similar to textile works by  Bauhaus women - Gunta Stölzl, Anni Albers, Gertrud Preiswerk and others.\n\nWhen Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919, he proclaimed that “every eligible person whose talent and training are considered adequate will be accepted without regard to age and sex.” However, in practice, discriminatory gender roles were reinforced, and female students were guided and advised to work with textiles rather than in workshops for heavy crafts such as carpentry. Despite that, Gropius’s “women’s section” became one of its most collaborative and brave experimental sectors. \n\nA hundred years later, it is disappointing to see we still carry on with inherited gender roles. Check the number of female computer science students in your country. How are things going \"at the intersection of arts and technology\"? I've implemented some of the percentages from Serbia in the distribution of shapes in the final compositions. I sampled the number of female vs. male students at the Faculty of Mathematics and the University of Arts (where I studied and now work), and gender distribution among graduated students, and it didn't look bad at all. But then I realized I'm the only female professor (out of 5) teaching main subjects at doctoral studies program in digital arts.\n\n\"When a group is underrepresented, people come to take that underrepresentation as the norm.\" Since representation is imperative to achieving equality, it is equally critical to change the biases we’ve developed over centuries.\n\nFor the title, I chose a dated version of the word for a female weaver on purpose. My native language is one of the Slavic languages, which are all gender sensitive. It is natural to have feminitives, but since historically some occupations were less (or not at all) practiced by women, many of the feminitives for those professions, jobs, and specializations are rarely used or don't exist in the dictionary. Also, not surprisingly, the dominant version of the noun describing a person who weaves in Serbian would be the female noun \"tkalja\", whereas the male version is so rare that is missing from some dictionaries. Conscientiously choosing the female version of the noun for the title, I position myself and this piece in the historical context with Bauhaus weveresses, contemporary language, and gender contexts, and finally in the curatorial context of the exhibition. \n\nCode Weaveresses is part of the FEMGEN exhibition curated by Micol Ap @verticalcrypoto in partnership with @RtClick_Save and @artblocks_io.\n",

For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

As a result, iron bars were installed outside windows, giving the appearance of prison cells (of course, there are also other more complex or fundamental reasons). However, Taiwan does have beautiful iron window grates. Skilled craftsmen used to handcraft these grates, and each piece resembled a work of art. The attention to detail and clever design of the patterns were evident.\n\nThis artwork represents my memories of Taiwan's architectural culture. It incorporates elements such as interesting walls, intricate window grates, broken tiles, and dense old apartments.\n\nClick ‘s’ or double-click on the canvas will save the output as a png.\n\nMade with p5.js, in Taiwan.\n\n------------\n\n台湾の建築の大部分は、見た目があまり美しいとは言えないと感じます。その理由はいくつかありますが、その一つは昔の治安の悪さによるもので、人々が窓の外に鉄格子を設置したことが挙げられます。その結果、窓が牢獄のように見えてしまいます（もちろん、他にもさらに複雑な理由や基本的な要素も存在します）。\nしかしながら、台湾には手作りの美しい「鉄窓花」（レトロな鉄製の窓）も存在します。昔は鉄窓花を作る職人が多かったのです。それぞれが芸術品のようで、作者のディテールへのこだわりやデザインの巧妙さが伺えます。\n\nこの作品は、私が台湾の建築文化に対する思い出を再現したものであり、印象深い壁と鉄窓花、割れたタイル、密集した古いアパートなどが組み合わさっています。\n\n------------\n\n台灣的建物大部分蠻不好看的，有許多原因，其中一個可能是早年的治安不佳，導致大家都在窗戶外面再安裝了鐵窗，於是每個窗戶看起來都像是牢籠（當然還有更多更複雜或是更基本的原因）。然而，台灣不是沒有好看的鐵窗，在早年有許多老師傅會手工製作鐵窗花，每一件都像藝術品，可以看到作者對細節的講究和圖案設計的巧思。\n\n這個作品就是在重現我對台灣建築文化的記憶，混雜著一些難以忘記的牆面、窗花、破碎的磁磚、密集的老公寓等等。",

We as humans have a need to leave traces - stories - that others can read and learn from. What will be the traces machines want to leave? This piece employs sinusoidal signals drawn with lines as a simple metaphor for every trace and every language, for every message and every communication.\n\necologías-A is an entity that is part of a broader ecology. Released on occasion of the show \"Unbound - Ecology in the Age of Machines\" at Unit London. The data generated by this entity is read by a different piece minted on Ethereum, creating a link between Tezos and Ethereum, a metaphor for an ecology of blockchains.\n\nit shares a common element with two other works released on fxhash: ecologías B and ecologías C, all of them contributing data to aforementioned pieces.\n\nread more at https://www.iillucid.com/ecologias\n\n15% of primary sales are donated to institutions working towards improving biodiversity and environmental efforts.\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nBuilt on p5.js, glsl\n\nappend &pd=N (N a number) to the URL in live view to increase/decrease resolution\npress s to save current image in current resolution\npress z,x,g,b,n followed by +/- to increase/decrease, respectively, brightness, contrast, gamma, blur, noise",
