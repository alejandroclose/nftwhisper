            "description": "On the surface, a Cellulaire is a surface! But notice; often porous, it's also a locus. \nLocus of millions of very tiny lines, one bit and one layer at a time connecting many dots. Different species of Cellular Automata (studied by John von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam, Stephen Wolfram, and John Horton Conway) the surface hosts. The little cells interact with their neighbors following simple rules. To express themselves, in multitudes of colors, they have evolved novel gene pools.\n\nA Cellulaire may have inside itself yet bigger cells; those created by its surface intersecting itself. And on its membrane that is porous, it hosts whimsical vesicles, or maybe a lotus; sometimes hiding in private quarters, draped with fanciful silk, velvet, or lace.\n\nBut let's go beyond all this hocus pocus.\n\nSome Cellulaires look like chapels; light peeking through their stained glass windows. Others look more like walled gardens, orchards, or vineyards of grapes. And some look like modern architectural spaces; have you ever stood or walked inside the Sequence (by Richard Serra)? To me, a Cellulaire is a meditation about life itself: how all systems and organisms, natural or man-made, are modular and cellular, built from smaller subsystems with their own boundaries and membranes, that interact, communicate, and evolve together, giving rise to ever more complex systems, patterns, structures, and behaviors. \n\nWith all that, the lotus now invites you to a meditative focus while this opus is rendered on its locus.\n\nControls:\n- Click the mouse to pause/unpause.\n- Press 's' to save a PNG file.\n- Press 't' to toggle, for a larger and higher resolution version that might be partially off screen. Once fully rendered, save a bonus 4800x4800 PNG file by pressing 's'. Toggle back to the original size by pressing 't' again.\n\nLicense:\nSee included LICENSE.md\n\nCredits:\nMade in p5js.",

Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM.
