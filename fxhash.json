It plays on my own fascination with scale models and bird's-eye views, as well as technical drawings.\n\nThe number of parameters that can be tweaked was purposefully kept to a minimum. Even the best planners cannot (and maybe should not try to) account for everything.\n\nDuring the late stages of the creative process, I read Jane Jacobs's 1958 essay 'Downtown is for People' and it played an important role in how I decided to frame this work. The last words, especially, stuck with me: 'Designing a dream city is easy; rebuilding a living one takes imagination.'\n\n—\n\nWhat You See Is What You Get: the minter’s wallet and seed parameter are used to seed the algorithm. Your mint will look exactly as it appears in the preview.\n\n—\n\nControls\nS - PNG export\nV - animated SVG export\nG - GIF export\nP - plottable SVG export\nF - fullscreen\nC - hide/show cursor\nSPACE/click - pause/unpause animations\n\n—\n\nCreated by loackme, 2023\n",

Differences in pressure, temperature, state, all act in pursuit of equilibrium. Given enough time, a closed system will eventually fall into an even dispersal. Somewhere in between is some yet-to-be-determined point at which beautiful unexpected forms emerge.\n\nThis system takes the standard model of equal exchange and throws it off balance, so each reaction will randomly decide which side has an advantage over the other, and instead of dispersal, one force will win out.\n\nIn this system, do similar complex patterns appear? Will we see anything new that doesn't appear with our usual rules?\n\nI found this idea very interesting, that even with no law towards chaos, actually the opposite, we can still end in formlessness. A blank end where no pixel differs from another.\n\nI think that through observation of the world and experimenting with its concepts, we can learn far more about life than just the processes we're studying. \n\nI'd be very curious to hear about what you take away from the work, and where your somewhere might be <3\n\nPress the space bar to add another step toward chaos\nPress ‘p’ to add 10 steps (enters mode 2)\nPress ‘f’ to enter an animation that will run for 1,056,993,066,125,486,216,810,417,723,659,732,792 years\nPress 'f' again to pause\nPress ‘a’ to add a new section of order to the system, you can use this when one state has taken over the canvas\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png\nPress ‘1’ or ‘2’ to begin render between the default 3200x4000px or 6400x8000px\n\nCreated by Chris McCully using p5.js, chroma.js, and GLSL.\n\nBuilt to run best on Chrome and Chromium based browsers.",

            "description": "ASCII-SCAPE\n\nLike for many others growing up during the 1980s & 90s, my very first hands-on encounter with actual computer graphics (outside of games) was in the form of \"textmode\" and its various alphanumeric characters and other symbols available on the 8bit home computers of that period. These machines were perfectly capable of producing fairly high-resolution & multi-color graphics (all relative), yet most systems booted into an interactive prompt with the so-called textmode as de-facto standard environment, providing a level, if also limited, playing field for the creation of text-based graphics from a patchwork of characters & symbols of a predefined font (system or custom). As is so often the case, limitation is the mother of invention and the regular, monospaced grid and standardized set of characters quickly encouraged an entire subculture of specialized designers & artists to emerge (which is currently being re-discovered & remixed by younger generations), applying & showcasing their creativity (with often surprisingly ingenious skills) in the form of game designs, user interfaces, disk mags, demoscene productions, competitions, flyers, BBSes and even various early Web designs of the mid/late 90s.\n\nASCII-SCAPE is an attempted non-nostalgic homage to these roots & culture. It is also a textmode-only (no canvas!) rework of my previous piece C-SCAPE. It combines my love of cellular automata with the stripped back aesthetics & limitations of using only text as representation medium of these co-evolving generative systems. It required an almost complete rewrite & re-curation of various elements: 1200+ new handpicked rule combinations, 32 character sets, 40 color themes, new relationships & biases to better manage the resulting textures, densities and contrast.\n\nAlthough technically not strictly \"ASCII\" (an actual standard, but also a popular shorthand for \"text only\"), the entire simulation only uses various Unicode characters and the beautiful Iosevka open source typeface by Renzhi Li aka Belleve Invis.\n\nLike its parent C-SCAPE, this project is dynamic and evolves indefinitely. It's best viewed on non-mobile devices, where there's a decent horizontal resolution to provide sufficient simulation space. Please see the C-SCAPE project description for further details. There's no graphical export feature, but output can be captured into an UTF-8 plain text file (max. 100k lines/generations).\n\nThe following keyboard shortcuts are available:\n\n- space : toggle simulation updates (pause/play)\n- r : randomize environment\n- x : start/stop recording\n- f : toggle scroll speed (fast/slow)\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nIosevka typeface licensed under OFL-1.1 license\n\nhttps://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and https://thi.ng",

            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

Auction will stop changing price when non-reserves are fully minted.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nNature’s wild flourish and untamed growth wondrously represent the exacting function of beauty — a function that is at once useful and infinitely creative. Perhaps nowhere is this delicate symbiosis better observed than in the flower, wherein a pure balance of physical fundamentals exists beneath ornate patterns and elaborate aesthetics.\n\nAmongst the layers of undulating, vividly colored petals, attention-grabbing stigma and stamen, and lusciously decorative features, nature’s organic abundance and disorder disguises its masterful propensity for precision. Each of the flower’s components evolve through unpredictable interactions with an unwieldy natural environment, creating spectacular adaptations that emerge from the tension between what attracts.\n\nRococo painters appreciated the organic fluidity found in flowers and vegetal forms, using their joyful abundance to depict a break from the rigid and stoic period the artists hoped to leave behind. They sought to reframe perfection away from predictability and toward compositions as surprising as the natural world around them.\n\nThus, ‘Rococo’ is a generative distortion of an old tradition: a digital painting created entirely with code that interprets and processes the natural world’s dichotomies. This painting algorithm builds upon natural structures while melding and moving their colors beyond form, growing randomly organic iterations that are as perfect as they are imperfect.\n\nCreated by Ori Ben-Shabat & Ronen Tanchum @Phenomenalabs\nCreative contributions from Tender @tender_art\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTechnical Details:\n\n- Mobile/GPU Intensive\n- Press “s” to save a .png of the artwork in live view\n- Press “p” to render a high res output + press “s” to save a printable .png",

            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",
