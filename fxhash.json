He’s always got some relatable story from his life I’ve never heard before, OR he hits me with the same piece of advice he’s been giving me for as long as I can remember:\n\n“Of course it’s hard to stay calm when you look at the pile in front of you. Every responsibility, want and obligation, is not something we’re meant to face all at once. Break it up, take on one task from the pile, and focus on that.”\n\nThis has been such a stable pattern that I often don’t need to hear him say it. I’ll finish describing what’s going on and stop him before he can even start, so he doesn’t have to waste his breath on something I should know by now, it’s already helping just to remember it.\n\nThe best thing I can do for myself is to pick something out of the pile and handle it in isolation. I find that often each task will grow the pile exponentially. It’s easy to handle my health and fitness when that’s all I have to think about. But then I have to think about finances, maintaining friendships, taking care of my plants, dating, and finding time for a hobby. Each one of those things has its own nuances and complications. With all that in mind, going to the gym sounds overwhelming.\n\nBut— Going to the gym is easy. Pick one thing, focus, get it done, and watch the pile shrink. Repeat.\n\nI’ve opted to create a design which illustrates this overwhelm and demonstrates how quickly those individual tasks lose form in the pile.\n\nPress 's' to save a .png\nPress '1', '2', or '3' to change render size\nPress 't' to toggle linen texture (for use printing onto textured paper or cloth)\n\nCreated by Chris McCully in October 2023 using p5.js, chroma.js, and GLSL",

            "description": "\"Herbarium\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022\n\nOccasionally, I stumble upon vintage scientific illustrations on various topics, exotically looking charts and graphs, alternative layouts for the periodic tables or psychological research diagrams, elaborate illustrations of botany and zoology, minerals, and natural and sometimes unnatural phenomena. Most of those illustrations are part of the \"art and science\" practices from the 18th and 19th centuries. At the core of those practices were observation and interpretation, unraveling complexity through visualizing abstract ideas or finding a creative approach for understanding previously incomprehensible forms. \n\nI'm an admirer of two female pioneers in the field. Maria Sibylla Merian created, with immense dedication, a book with intricate illustrations of plants and insects, later praised by scientists. On the other hand, Anna Atkins published a book with beautiful botanical cyanotypes, considered the first book with photographic images. These topics are the visual inspiration for pieces presented at ArtBasel HK. \n\nMy mathematical background makes me naturally attracted to graphs, converting numbers to curves, and everything schematically displayed. Also, combining scientific symbols and illustrations with imaginary data inspires the spectator to find meaning in unrelated or random things or provokes latent skepticism towards assumed concepts of truth, reality, and knowledge.

            "description": "Compartmentalization in service of clarity.\nDedicated to my Dad and, by extension, his advice.\n\nWhen I get overwhelmed (which is often), I typically call my dad. He’s always got some relatable story from his life I’ve never heard before, OR he hits me with the same piece of advice he’s been giving me for as long as I can remember:\n\n“Of course it’s hard to stay calm when you look at the pile in front of you. Every responsibility, want and obligation, is not something we’re meant to face all at once. Break it up, take on one task from the pile, and focus on that.”\n\nThis has been such a stable pattern that I often don’t need to hear him say it. I’ll finish describing what’s going on and stop him before he can even start, so he doesn’t have to waste his breath on something I should know by now, it’s already helping just to remember it.\n\nThe best thing I can do for myself is to pick something out of the pile and handle it in isolation. I find that often each task will grow the pile exponentially. It’s easy to handle my health and fitness when that’s all I have to think about. But then I have to think about finances, maintaining friendships, taking care of my plants, dating, and finding time for a hobby. Each one of those things has its own nuances and complications. With all that in mind, going to the gym sounds overwhelming.\n\nBut— Going to the gym is easy. Pick one thing, focus, get it done, and watch the pile shrink. Repeat.\n\nI’ve opted to create a design which illustrates this overwhelm and demonstrates how quickly those individual tasks lose form in the pile.\n\nPress 's' to save a .png\nPress '1', '2', or '3' to change render size\nPress 't' to toggle linen texture (for use printing onto textured paper or cloth)\n\nCreated by Chris McCully in October 2023 using p5.js, chroma.js, and GLSL",

They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "(The things that were not there yesterday)\n\nThis work was developed during the Vertical Crypto Art Residency 5th Cohort (January-to-March 2023), and part of end exhibition.\n\nAbout the work:\n\nIt all started as a study on textures, and how they can evoke sensations or their memories. The textures are transformed, and they take on entity, volume, and claim their own story.\n\nBut what is important is how every process with the artistic materiality takes us to unexpected places. To places that were not there yesterday, that were not there a moment ago.\n\n“Las cosas que ayer no estaban” is a way of talking about time, yesterday sometimes evokes nostalgia, but also memories. Yesterday there were things that are no longer there today, but leave room for new things, new sensations.\n\nThe evocation of memories of the senses is something that I am interested in as a trigger for each work.

            "description": "Toccata is a piece about decay, about the impermanent. The emergence over time or, rather, progression of entropy is a key characteristic of our universe. Everything evolves to nothing. We as mortal beings have sometimes trouble reconciling with this idea. Humans have sought immortality for millennia, be it through ancient potions or modern medicine, be it from leaving a legacy that we feel will stand the test of time. It will, only to decay later than us.\n\nToccata is a piece about change. Change lies at the heart of human cognition and human nature. Our thoughts and our emotions happen over time, and are a function of the change that is both around us and at the very core of our selves. Change comes in nature in cycles. Seasons of growth, seasons of ripe fruits of life, seasons of decay, of death, rebirth.\n\nToccata is music. We find music to convey some of the deepest streams of human condition, connecting it to some other form of being. Music also happens over time, and music happens because of change. Music encodes our feelings better than any other aid we may have. Toccata incorporates this at its very core, as the main sound is Andreas' family piano where he learned to play, sampled this past July.\n\nRead more about the piece, and the collaboration between Marcelo and Andreas on andreasrau.eu/toccata\n\n---\n\nBasic controls:\n- Click on the piece or press spacebar to start it (WebAudio requires user intervention for the music to start).

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",
