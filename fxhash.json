            "description": "In march of this year, I started working on a new series involving multi-layering, and overriding shapes. Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

Different species evolve and interact together, resulting in stabilizing patterns out of their parametric configurations. A form of artificial life.\n\nThis work is based on the paper \"Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks\", written by Jeff Jones and popularized in the artistic field by Sage Jenson. Some features were added to increase the visual and behavioral complexity of the system. Agents are divided into different species, with their own set of rules and interacting with their own substrate. Substrates also interact with each other and agents will mutate in contact of some of them.\n\nNFT License\nRuns properly on Chrome 97.0.4692.99\nGPU intensive\n\nPress P to pause (double tab touch devices)\nPress",

            "description": "Acequia (“ah-seh-kee-uh”) - a Spanish adaptation of the Arabic word as-sāqiya, meaning “water carrier”. \n\nIn our second collaboration, Rich and Rick are back with our blend of generative code, intricate design, attention to detail, and a splash of charm. \n\n Acequias are traditional irrigation canals used to distribute rainwater and snowmelt along a complex network of narrow channels. They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

            "description": "In march of this year, I started working on a new series involving multi-layering, and overriding shapes. Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

            "description": "Eucalyptus and Sagebrush is inspired by the eucalyptus trees and sagebrush found in California. These plants, and the hills they inhabit, have long been a source of beauty and adventure in my life, and I find myself repeatedly drawn back to them. The sunsets in coastal California are a perfect compliment to these hills, and I set out to represent that combination in this work.\n\nEach iteration of this algorithm feels, to me, like a glimpse out of a car window on a drive up the coast, a pause on a cool morning hike, or a memory of tearing through sharp underbrush with good company.\n\nStylistically and texturally, I drew from landscapes rendered in oil pastels, placing thousands of tiny circles, alluding to the effect of depositing particles of color onto paper. \n\nI hope that this work evokes in the viewer the feelings of peace, wildness, and adventure that I feel when I watch the sun set over these hills.\n\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\nNotes:\n- Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.",

            "description": "The output of MAGNETIK reminds me of what tornadoes do to our cities and buildings, yet I imagine the pieces that are about to break off and fly away to be made of metal foil and they do so because of a magnetic force that is pulling them away from where they belong…  This one is also a charity run :  \n- 20% of the primary sales will go directly to the Processing Foundation, \n\n- Remaining 80% will be donated to a group of individuals that raise money to buy computers for less fortunate architecture students in a university in the eastern part of Turkey. Please read the next paragraph for a detailed explanation\n\n- I will decide what to do with the secondary sales later if there will be any.\n\nAbout the majority (80%) of the donation : I decided that the donations should be done in a double-blind way, the donator does not know who they are donating to, and the receivers of the donation will not know from whom the donation is coming from, hence I will transfer the funds these individuals mentioned to act as a middle-step. I feel like this is a hard thing to provide a solid proof for, so I recommend if you have doubts and/or straight away do not trust me or this process, do not mint. I will only be able to provide proof of transfer of funds to a third-party. I trust the people I am sending the funds to, we have done this before (not to brag or anything) and I know that we are affecting younger people’s life in a good way. Also, I believe that the funds raised from this project alone will not be enough to buy one decent config. computer by itself, if it were so, I would have done it differently.  About MAGNETIK :  \nMAGNETIK plays on the idea of distorting and breaking grids by employing an illusion of fake 3D and tries to make the resulting composition look good with rhythm and color harmony.\n \n- 21 palettes,\n- 2 background modes : lights on / lights off,\n- 3 grid types,\n- plus some surprise features…\n\nI encourage you to try and see the variations before minting :)  2 of the grid types are based on https://gorillasun.de/blog/an-algorithm-for-irregular-grids by Ahmad Moussa ( https://twitter.com/gorillasu ) and used with his knowledge and kind permission.\n\ngradient formulas are based on https://twitter.com/takawo/status/1505876107492720651?s=20&t=S9aU_oNYyjBieBcEmvUV-g\nby Takawo Shunsuke ( https://twitter.com/takawo ) and used with his knowledge and kind permission.\n\nThank you all in advance and have a good day!\n\nDISCLAIMER : I am not a good coder, I have tried to fix my past mistakes from my earlier projects to make some room for new mistakes :) I am hoping that there isn’t any huge bugs or anything left so you can enjoy your mint! Please hit me up if you have any concerns after minting and we can discuss a solution.\n",
