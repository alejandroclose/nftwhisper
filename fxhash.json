            "description": "Following my previous work, \"初夏の旅路　Traveling in Early Summer,\" I am thrilled to present my second creation dedicated to the cherished memories of Japanese summer. This time, I aim to capture the essence of one of the most iconic elements associated with the season: fireworks, or as the Japanese call it, \"HANABI.\"\n\nWhen one Japanese thinks of summer in Japan, HANABI is undoubtedly the first thing that comes to mind for many. Its roots can be traced back to 1733, during the Edo period, when a water festival was held along the Sumida River. In those challenging times of famine and epidemics, fireworks were launched as a poignant memorial for the departed souls. This marked the birth of the fireworks display tradition. As years passed, fireworks festivals became a widespread and beloved event, interwoven into the fabric of Japanese culture. The spectacle of fireworks aligns perfectly with the evening cooling culture that has developed in response to the sweltering summer climate. It has become a treasured symbol of the Japanese summer experience.\n\nIn 2019, I had the privilege of witnessing two mesmerizing fireworks displays in Tokyo. The sheer beauty and inspiring nature of these displays left an indelible mark on my soul. However, due to the unprecedented challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, many of these cherished festivals were put on hold about 2 or 3 years. The good news is that this year, firework festivals across Japan are set to resume as scheduled, offering a glimmer of hope and excitement. Despite the sweltering summer heat, gathering with dear friends to enjoy the magnificent burst of colors and light would undoubtedly be an unforgettable experience.\n\nWith this work, I aspire to evoke the same sense of wonder and joy that accompanies witnessing a firework show. I hope to illuminate your heart and mind, leaving you with beautiful memories akin to the enchantment of fireworks. Let the vibrant explosions of color and the crackling sound of fireworks transport you to a realm of pure delight, even if just for a fleeting moment.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nSave as a Picture:\n\nPress “s”or “S” to download a PNG copy of the artwork.",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "- \"A place for everything, everything in its place\": A Metaphor for Organized and Environmental -\n\nHave you ever heard the phrase \"a place for everything and everything in its place\"? It's been around for centuries and is often credited to Benjamin Franklin. Basically, it means that when you're organized and keep things in their proper order, you're setting yourself up for success in all areas of life. When we remember that \"place is the world and the world is where everything is\", we begin to see the interconnectedness of all things and the impact our actions can have on the natural environment.\n\nBut did you know that this principle can also have a positive impact on the environment? As humans (?) continue to build and expand our cities and towns, we often disrupt natural ecosystems and habitats. This can lead to a bunch of environmental issues, like pollution, erosion, and a loss of biodiversity. By implementing \"a place for everything and everything in its place\" in our urban planning and waste management practices, we can help minimize these negative effects and create a more sustainable future.\n\nFor example, by carefully designing cities with spaces designated for different functions, like parks, residential areas, and commercial districts, we can better manage our resources and reduce our impact on the natural world. And when it comes to waste management, things like recycling and separating organic waste from hazardous materials can help reduce the amount of waste that ends up polluting our land and water.\n\nIt's important to remember that our actions have consequences and that everything is connected. By recognizing our role in the natural world and taking steps to preserve and protect it, we can help ensure that everything continues to have a place in it. So next time you're feeling disorganized, remember that a little effort can go a long way, not just in your personal life, but for the health of the planet too!\n\n------------------------------\nPress 's': to save (the world)\n------------------------------",

            "description": "The Cosmic Soup represents the early Universe shortly after the Big Bang. At this time, the Universe was extremely hot and energetic. As it expanded and cooled, the particles in the cosmic soup began to combine and form atoms, eventually giving rise to the first stars and galaxies.\n\nThe algorithm uses a combination of chaotic systems, geometry, and algebra to paint in real-time a representation of our Universe in the era when it was all one. Although most 20 color palettes have a dark background, others play with the algorithm's possibilities and represent space more abstractly.\n\nPlease read 'Dripping Pixels: Making \"The Cosmic Soup\"' for a complete explanation of this artwork's inspiration and creation.\n\nThe project is best viewed on a computer with good performance and in a high-resolution display.\n\n- Press 'S' on the keyboard to save it as a PNG of 4096x2304 pixels or 5400x2304 pixels.\n- Press 'F' on the keyboard to go full screen and restart the animation.\n- Press 'R' on the keyboard to restart the animation.\n- Press 'space' on the keyboard to pause the animation.",

            "description": "\"Slice of Life\" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",
