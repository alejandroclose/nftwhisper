            "description": "The series employs fractal circles to create repeating patterns, using a monochrome color palette on the canvas. The number, size, and density of circles as well as the level of recursion, vary across pieces. The introduction of these variations and arcs adds a new dimension to fractals by juxtaposing their self-similar nature at all scales with elements of randomness.\n\nThis is my third series in a row that features a monochromatic color palette. There's something about the limitation of using only binary colors that enables me to appreciate abstraction purely for its form.\n\nNote on the name: The series draws its name from Sayed Haider Raza of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group. I have always admired Raza’s use of sacred geometry and his abstract work has forever been a source of inspiration. Raza believed that ‘Bindu’ (the dot, point or circle) is the ultimate point of creation, representing the universe in its entirety.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen. Press s to save an svg file.\n\nPixel Love!\n",

            "description": "A Cellular Dice Piece\n\nComputational modeling is the use of computers to simulate and study complex systems using mathematics, physics and computer science. A computational model contains numerous variables that characterize the system being studied. Simulation is done by adjusting the variables alone or in combination and observing the outcomes. Computer modeling allows scientists to conduct thousands of simulated experiments by computer. The thousands of computer experiments identify the handful of laboratory experiments that are most likely to solve the problem being studied.\n\nToday's sociocultural discourse might obscure the fact that humanity has been using artificial modeling techniques since ancient times. Permutations, calculus, algorithms are not exclusive to our time, but these are ubiquituous methods that can be found in many cultural entities where members of the community progress and develop their environment through cooperative decisions and consensus. Since computers were not available in the past, calculation methods, application of chance, randomness and probability were performed using other methods, like dices, sticks, cards, weather, rituals or other manifestations.\n\nDice are small, throwable objects with marked sides that can rest in multiple positions. They are used for generating random numbers, commonly as part of tabletop games, including dice games, board games, role-playing games, and games of chance. A traditional die is a cube with each of its six faces marked with a different number of dots (pips) from one to six. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing a random integer from one to six on its upper surface, with each value being equally likely. These tools were often used when a decision required to outsource human subjective elements into an objective environment.\n\nDivination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appears to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. If a distinction is to be made between divination and fortune-telling, divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a religious context, as seen in traditional African medicine. Divination has long been criticized. In the modern era, it has been dismissed by the scientific community and skeptics as being superstitious; experiments do not support the idea that divination techniques can actually predict the future more reliably or precisely than would be possible without it.\n\nThis idea is especially adaptable to the data driven belief systems of our time, where human decision making involves trust in omnipresent although obscure and biased artificial intelligence, esoteric pattern analysis, DIY heuristics, magic numbers among others. \n\nPress 'h' to switch between high/low resolution pixel density (set to low for mobiles)\n\nTouch to listen",

            "description": "“Winesburg, Ohio” is an act of uncanny place-making. The collection borrows its name from a 1919 short-story cycle by Sherwood Anderson, which explores a peculiar cast of characters living within a fictionalized, midwestern town. Like Anderson’s text, the “Winesburg, Ohio” algorithm constructs a world through recurring portrayals of specific structures and landmarks. Its scenes are populated by a variety of familiar elements taken from my larger body of work, including water towers, houses, and churches. Meanwhile, a series of scripted gestures insert abstract compositional elements into the outputs, counteracting their pictorial legibility. The strange landscapes that result are composite ideograms, comprised of multiple spatial possibilities that co-exist in varying states of contradiction.",

            "description": "## regenerate : what is it about? ##\n\nI wanted the gradients to portray our inner energy status, like a power charge we keep regenerating. Made of many steps, they create the illusion of continuity. And, just like us, they sometimes disfunction.❤️\n\nThe title illustrates both the energy of these geometric outputs and my own return to a generative art practice. It's also a nod to the \"degen\" culture.\n\n## variations ##\n\nregenerate has 3 types of outputs:\n- the single column, in full color - these are the main outputs and define the visual identity of the drop - pure energy!\n- the single color column on grey - pure contrast!\n- the triplet - dysfunctional in the best sense!\nWell, there might be a 4th type, but that's a surprise...\n\nFor each mint, the number of steps will vary from 60 to 200+. The way the gradients blend into the larger background also depends on the mint: some blend completely, while other tend to the background color but never quite reach it.\n\n## Keyboards controls ##\n\n's' saves a high-res version of your output (4096x4096 px)\n‘m’ saves a low-res version (500 x 500 px), useful for social media\n'p' saves TWO smartphone formatted crops (1176 x 2556 px) so you can take your mint with you all day - one in full saturation, one at half saturation - you can use one for your lockscreen and one for your homescreen, for example, or you can make your own crops from the high-res image.\n\n## Technical note ##\n\nDepending on the size of your window, the number of steps may vary. That is intentional, and made to avoid any moire effects when scaling down. Instead, the overall impression of the output will remain visually the same at any scale.\n\n## Conclusion ## \n\nI hope you enjoy your mint, whether it's a single, triplet, or a powerful color on grey!\nThanks for reading and thanks for minting! 🙏\n\n-raphael, sept. 2023.",

Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers.

As Christopher Scussel continues to revamp the EXPLOR engine I endeavor to understand its capabilities as an aesthetic tool.\n\nThe inherent qualities of an original EXPLOR image is it is low resolution and uses a 4 gray scale color palette. When it was used in the 1970’s images were often generated this way as a series of frames then recorded on film and manipulated in post production. In this image we use a higher resolution (250x250) and employ 3x3 “blocks” of pixels instead of alphanumeric character combinations that we can render in 24bit color. \n\nTHE EXPLOR language consists of a set of functions that manipulate the contents of an internal array. Each element in internal display memory maps into a block in the output image.

The trick is how to make this visually interesting.\n\nI employ a grid structure to distribute a rectangular widget across the picture plane. The widget is a randomly defined area that grows in a random direction based on a set of random variables. During each iteration the new area overwrites internal memory (following a set  of rules).

Inspired by the beauty found in technological errors, this work seeks to find a potential aesthetic sense in the conjunction of animated and juxtaposed forms.\n\nThrough an algorithmic process, the piece develops as a juxtaposition of shapes that run across the canvas, leaving traces and emerging in a dynamic and evolving composition, capturing the essence of the unpredictable nature of fault lines.\n\n“Malfunction” is an invitation to immerse yourself in the chaotic beauty that arises from random processes. It is an attempt to reflect on the inherent beauty in imperfection, as it reminds us of the inherent fallibility within ourselves and our creations. Perhaps these fragmented forms make us imagine a place where disruptions become artistic expressions and dysfunctions become moments of aesthetic revelation.\n\ncreated by @mdollinger with p5js and chroma-js\n\n11 palettes\n1998 x 3000 px\n",

Some iterations eventually stop, some continue indefinitely.\n\nThe fun is that the project is implemented on a fragment shader. There is no array of grains of sand. Each pixel decides whether a grain of sand from a neighboring pixel will end up in it or not. This logic required a lot of banging my head against the wall, because the slightest mistake caused sand to disappear into nowhere or appear out of nothing and clutter up the entire space.\n\n0…9 — set speed\nspace — pause\ns — save picture\ndrag over — add more sand\nshift+drag — erase",

            "description": "This project is a cellular automata that simulates falling sand. The falling is deterministic: each sand particle will fall to the same place each time the program is run. Some iterations eventually stop, some continue indefinitely.\n\nThe fun is that the project is implemented on a fragment shader. There is no array of grains of sand. Each pixel decides whether a grain of sand from a neighboring pixel will end up in it or not. This logic required a lot of banging my head against the wall, because the slightest mistake caused sand to disappear into nowhere or appear out of nothing and clutter up the entire space.\n\n0…9 — set speed\nspace — pause\ns — save picture\ndrag over — add more sand\nshift+drag — erase",

The tip of the triangle is the uterus which makes the space grow.\n-- LIA DREI (Diaries, 2004)\n\nMy paintings have no past, they are empty of meaning in the present, but await the discussions of the future, as remotely as possible.\nAnd this is why they don't have their feet firmly planted in the ground, although there are invisible roots that take life from the earth, like so many blades of grass.\nWhile I work I look for the truth in what I do. The time is not yesterday because it would be false, it is not today because the emotion takes my breath away and I die every moment and am reborn after every new brushstroke.\nSoon after, time becomes old, useless, meaningless. I never know what will come out with the next brushstroke or spatula stroke.\nMy thoughts go at supersonic speed and only stop to choose another color. The one just painted is never the right one. So I live the life of the new painting with the sense of mystery that the moonless night has. (…)\n-- LIA DREI (Notes, 1962)\n\n----\n\nI never talk about myself.\n\nI'm not creative.\nI blatantly steal other people's art.\nI'm a bad coder, I copy, paste, mix ideas.\nI often ruin it, degrade it.\nBut I always make it mine what I like.\n\nI absorb.\n\n-- ALESSANDRO FIORE (fxhash, 2024)\n\n\n—————\n\nThe work is created responsive by default and it will adapt to the browser window. It will change (even consistently in some cases) based on the screen aspect ratio.\n\nKey commands:\n\n1 = Square 2000x2000\n2 = Square 4000x4000\n3 = Square 6000x6000 (Dependent on your browser limitations, tested on Safari (Mac))\np = Portrait 1500x2115\nl = Landscape 2115x1500\ne = Responsive/Default\nf = Fullscreen\ns = Save as image\n\n\nSee LICENSE.txt in live view for licensing details.\n",
