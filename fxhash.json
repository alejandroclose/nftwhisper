            "description": "The story behind this collection is that there isn't really a story behind this collection. It is the result of play, tinkering, and curiosity.\n\nOne of the beautiful things about generative art is how we can achieve drastically different results simply by modifying a few parameters or lines of code. As my first release here on fxhash was 'Sabler', it felt fitting that my release for #fxhashturnsone would itself be a modified version of that 'Sabler' algorithm, albeit giving drastically different results.\n\nIt is notable for the fact that this is perhaps my most 'chaotic' collection yet, letting go of carefully considered proportions, angles and positioning and here leaving that in the hands of the computer. In a way, this simple act represents several design decisions I never would have imagined myself making a year ago, highlighting my growth as a generative artist over the past year.\n\nIt is also a reflection of the inspiration gained from many of the artists and boundary-pushers in the space that each time unlock and encourage creations beyond the immediate comfort zone. For that, this is a 'Thank You' to all of you.\n\nWith that, here's to many more years of generative beauty and inspiration on fxhash and beyond.\n\nAs with previous collections, I highly recommend viewing the images at full size and savouring the details and the chaos up close. Pressing 'S' will save a 6000 x 6000 px PNG file.\n\n50% of primary sales will be donated to the Processing Foundation.",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s.

Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Some iterations eventually stop, some continue indefinitely.\n\nThe fun is that the project is implemented on a fragment shader. There is no array of grains of sand. Each pixel decides whether a grain of sand from a neighboring pixel will end up in it or not. This logic required a lot of banging my head against the wall, because the slightest mistake caused sand to disappear into nowhere or appear out of nothing and clutter up the entire space.\n\n0…9 — set speed\nspace — pause\ns — save picture\ndrag over — add more sand\nshift+drag — erase",

Each pixel decides whether a grain of sand from a neighboring pixel will end up in it or not. This logic required a lot of banging my head against the wall, because the slightest mistake caused sand to disappear into nowhere or appear out of nothing and clutter up the entire space.\n\n0…9 — set speed\nspace — pause\ns — save picture\ndrag over — add more sand\nshift+drag — erase",

            "description": "\"Liaisons dangereuses\" is a creative exploration of implausible relations between figurative art and poetry. Our AI poet learned on the basis of texts about artists and their work. It memorized all subtleties of a language designed to describe visual emotions and artworks. This language is the tool for creating countless poems about artistic concepts, which range from techniques to materials to artists, etc. But the link is two-sided: if the poet is fed by art language, the concepts expressed by poems do, in turn, influence the appearance of the artwork. Color palettes, pattern types and the flow of the graphic composition are indeed determined by the semantics of the poem.\nIn each minting, the poet will produce either a short poem (a iambic 5-7-5 haiku  or a iambic cinquain according to Adelaide Crapsey style) or a single verse (either an alexandrine, or a iambic pentameter or an anapestic tetrameter). There are 625 artistic concepts that can trigger a poem, and each concept can generate countless different semantically coherent poems. The poet is completely \"unchained\": contents might be peaceful harmonic assertions as well as embarrassing, politically incorrect claims.\n\nYou can save to file the image by pressing the \"s\" key.",

            "description": "Cry Diversity is just that - a cry for greater diversity and equality in the genArt community. The UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity beautifully states, “As a source of exchange, innovation and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature.”  Who better to usher in an age of true appreciation for, and active promotion of cultural diversity than a community of artists and collectors.\n\nExcerpts from the UNESCO declaration are embedded in the piece in the form of asemic writing, infusing the piece with the power of the message as it charms the eye.  The collector will also be able to select one of twenty affirmations to be embedded in the work.  Each minted edition will stand as a prayer flag waving permanently on the blockchain spreading its message of belief in a world where we are all valued and respected.  Cry Diversity will be free to collect, but it comes with a challenge.  The collector is expected to actively research the cryptoArt community to find an artist new to them that is a member of an underrepresented group (female, LBGTQIA2+, female identifying, non-binary, POC, global south, etc.).  They are then expected to actively promote that artist and their work for at least one week.  They are expected to personally raise their voice.  Cry Diversity is the second in a series of projects (see the companion piece fx(elevate)) designed to bring attention to individual artists as well as to the value of true commitment to diversity within our community.  It will not be the last.\n\nIt is time to make our cries heard and our actions felt!\n\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint a free edition.  Beginning in the 2nd week, the project will be open to the public for an additional week. Un-minted editions will be burned at the expiration of the 2nd week.\n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Choose your Cry.  Lock it.\n4) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \na) Seed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you have recorded the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the seed to retrieve it.\nb) Cry: What do you want our community to symbolize?  Respect, diversity, compassion?  Choose your favorite characteristic.  It will be baked into your output.\n\nProject Details:\nThis work uses the spectral.js library for the development of color palettes. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in June, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download. Press [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for printing.  \n",

            "description": "Cry Diversity is just that - a cry for greater diversity and equality in the genArt community. The UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity beautifully states, “As a source of exchange, innovation and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature.”  Who better to usher in an age of true appreciation for, and active promotion of cultural diversity than a community of artists and collectors.\n\nExcerpts from the UNESCO declaration are embedded in the piece in the form of asemic writing, infusing the piece with the power of the message as it charms the eye.  The collector will also be able to select one of twenty affirmations to be embedded in the work.  Each minted edition will stand as a prayer flag waving permanently on the blockchain spreading its message of belief in a world where we are all valued and respected.  Cry Diversity will be free to collect, but it comes with a challenge.  The collector is expected to actively research the cryptoArt community to find an artist new to them that is a member of an underrepresented group (female, LBGTQIA2+, female identifying, non-binary, POC, global south, etc.).  They are then expected to actively promote that artist and their work for at least one week.  They are expected to personally raise their voice.  Cry Diversity is the second in a series of projects (see the companion piece fx(elevate)) designed to bring attention to individual artists as well as to the value of true commitment to diversity within our community.  It will not be the last.\n\nIt is time to make our cries heard and our actions felt!\n\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint a free edition.  Beginning in the 2nd week, the project will be open to the public for an additional week. Un-minted editions will be burned at the expiration of the 2nd week.\n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Choose your Cry.  Lock it.\n4) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \na) Seed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you have recorded the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the seed to retrieve it.\nb) Cry: What do you want our community to symbolize?  Respect, diversity, compassion?  Choose your favorite characteristic.  It will be baked into your output.\n\nProject Details:\nThis work uses the spectral.js library for the development of color palettes. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in June, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.
