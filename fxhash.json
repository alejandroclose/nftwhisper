            "description": "\"I used to live in a small city placed at the center of Iran's plateau with the warmest summer days in the country part; spending most of my childhood with my sweet grandma at her old house. She was always keeping her eyes on me not to get heat stroke at noon playing in the yard when the sun was at its peak glowing furiously. Sundays at noon were my favorite, I used to call them “Ice cream” noons sitting beside the nicest person you could imagine and enjoying a delightful ice cream. You won't know how lovely it was to have an ice cream relaxing under the most enjoyable cold breeze of the tallest windcatcher in the city at her house. \"\n\n\n\nThe Badgirs city is the first collaboration between Fleep and IceRain on Fxhash. The concept was established first with the design of a school with a feeling of safe and nostalgia reminding us of the good memories of our childhood as the grandma’s house and the windcatcher for Fleep.\nA windcatcher (Badgir) is an Iranian traditional architectural element in the form of a small tower built on the roof of houses in warm locations to create passive cooling. The collection of Badgirs city is a modern recreational development of those traditional windcatchers designed by Fleep and icerain and exquisitely translated into code by Icerain.\n\nControls:\n[1] Set the resolution to Medium Resolution\n[2] Set the resolution to High Resolution",

            "description": "The story behind this collection is that there isn't really a story behind this collection. It is the result of play, tinkering, and curiosity.\n\nOne of the beautiful things about generative art is how we can achieve drastically different results simply by modifying a few parameters or lines of code. As my first release here on fxhash was 'Sabler', it felt fitting that my release for #fxhashturnsone would itself be a modified version of that 'Sabler' algorithm, albeit giving drastically different results.\n\nIt is notable for the fact that this is perhaps my most 'chaotic' collection yet, letting go of carefully considered proportions, angles and positioning and here leaving that in the hands of the computer. In a way, this simple act represents several design decisions I never would have imagined myself making a year ago, highlighting my growth as a generative artist over the past year.\n\nIt is also a reflection of the inspiration gained from many of the artists and boundary-pushers in the space that each time unlock and encourage creations beyond the immediate comfort zone. For that, this is a 'Thank You' to all of you.\n\nWith that, here's to many more years of generative beauty and inspiration on fxhash and beyond.\n\nAs with previous collections, I highly recommend viewing the images at full size and savouring the details and the chaos up close. Pressing 'S' will save a 6000 x 6000 px PNG file.\n\n50% of primary sales will be donated to the Processing Foundation.",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

She was always keeping her eyes on me not to get heat stroke at noon playing in the yard when the sun was at its peak glowing furiously. Sundays at noon were my favorite, I used to call them “Ice cream” noons sitting beside the nicest person you could imagine and enjoying a delightful ice cream. You won't know how lovely it was to have an ice cream relaxing under the most enjoyable cold breeze of the tallest windcatcher in the city at her house. \"\n\n\n\nThe Badgirs city is the first collaboration between Fleep and IceRain on Fxhash. The concept was established first with the design of a school with a feeling of safe and nostalgia reminding us of the good memories of our childhood as the grandma’s house and the windcatcher for Fleep.\nA windcatcher (Badgir) is an Iranian traditional architectural element in the form of a small tower built on the roof of houses in warm locations to create passive cooling. The collection of Badgirs city is a modern recreational development of those traditional windcatchers designed by Fleep and icerain and exquisitely translated into code by Icerain.\n\nControls:\n[1] Set the resolution to Medium Resolution\n[2] Set the resolution to High Resolution",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

Different species evolve and interact together, resulting in stabilizing patterns out of their parametric configurations. A form of artificial life.\n\nThis work is based on the paper \"Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks\", written by Jeff Jones and popularized in the artistic field by Sage Jenson. Some features were added to increase the visual and behavioral complexity of the system. Agents are divided into different species, with their own set of rules and interacting with their own substrate. Substrates also interact with each other and agents will mutate in contact of some of them.\n\nNFT License\nRuns properly on Chrome 97.0.4692.99\nGPU intensive\n\nPress P to pause (double tab touch devices)\nPress",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "RAUSCH is a series of generative artworks that explore imaginary digital architectures. \n\nThis series challenges traditional notions of architectural representation and raises important questions about the role of resolution in design. Just as the pixel resolution of an image affects its perceived quality, the resolution of an architectural space can affect its qualities and livability. By embracing digital variation through codes, this series explores the interplay between abstract and concrete space through multiple resolutions. \n\nRAUSCH is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by complex, chaotic and messy sensations, and aims to engage the viewer through a sense of wonder, disorientation, and awe.\n\nReleased on the occasion of Companions of Code, a group exhibition by VerticalCrypto Art at The NFT Gallery in London. \nCurated by Micol Ap.

            "description": "The idea of living within close proximity to nature has enticed people for centuries, especially for the ones used to living in bustling cities. Just picturing a cozy resort in the countryside, or playing music that resembles the feelings of holiday-making can drive us to go on a well-deserved vacation. Even when we don’t know where to, or whether we have the time or resources to slip out of our busy days, or even if that destination exists only in our imaginations. But when we do entertain ourselves with such ideas, we feel like we have taken a step to heal ourselves or to give our mind a worthy time out.\n\nOn the other hand, we have been living in human-focused settlements like cities for around 10,000 years, and we have all we need in an urban landscape, yet the idea of living in a secluded resort close to nature kept inviting us. This begs the question: were we supposed to live adjacent to nature to live well? Is it in our nature that we are wired to go back to the world beyond our doors? Or was it because we are aware of how big nature is, and how little time and resources we have to explore them all?\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Dec22",

Attractor is a visualization of community, a central interest bringing people together, pushing past their walls, bad habits, and traumas. The image is meant to be deceiving in its focus on the attractor, where the true focus is on the overlaps and complex defenses we build around ourselves. Those defenses can make us and those connections into more beautiful, ornate structures, or keep us distant from those around us. Sometimes focusing on a shared attractor is the only way we can let down our guard.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a .png\nPress ’t’ to toggle the grain for printing or personal preference\nPress ‘p’ to save a higher quality .png\nCreated with p5.js and chroma.js",
