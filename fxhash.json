You may notice two parameters in it: `quality` and `tiles`.\n\n`quality` is an integer from 1 to ~1000, the better the quality — the slower the rendering. Default is 200.\n\n`tiles` is a number of 256×256 px tiles to render. Can be an integer (for square images) or two integers separated with a comma (for rectangular). `tiles=9,16` will make an image with width of 9×256 px = 2304 px and height of 16×256 px = 4096 px. If not set, adapts to screen size.\n\nPress `s` to save the image.",

            "description": "Decadence should not be misunderstood. Over time, the word has had various meanings (political and cultural) but has also been associated with Symbolism and Aestheticism.\n\nThe contemporary definition of decadence emerged in the late 19th century and praised artifice over nature, sophistication over simplicity, at the same time defying contemporary discourse of decline by embracing subjects and styles that critics considered over-refined. \n\nNowadays, decadence also refers to stagnation and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of material prosperity and technological development which leads to an excessive indulgence in pleasure or luxury.\n\nIn this context, Decadence is a reflection on the collaboration between Jerome Herr and David Mrugala (thedotisblack). A collaboration that started several months ago with a simple grid of random values, that soon became an experiment of creativity, always in the search of expectations, interest in excessive indulgence of visual pleasure, a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged in a series of generative images with an aesthetics that values excess – That is Decadence.\n\n- press 's' to save a standard image\n- press 'h' to save a high resolution image\n\nJerome Herr\n\nJerome Herr is from Luxembourg. Since 2015 he has created generative art with a passion for design and visual explorations. He is an active member of the creative coding community and a successful NFT artist, both on Teia and Fxhash.\n\nDavid Mrugala\n\nDavid is a German architect and intermedia artist, who lives in South Korea. He is the founder of thedotisblack, a platform and an archive for research design on (generative) drawings and animations made with code.",

Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",

            "description": "ASCII-SCAPE\n\nLike for many others growing up during the 1980s & 90s, my very first hands-on encounter with actual computer graphics (outside of games) was in the form of \"textmode\" and its various alphanumeric characters and other symbols available on the 8bit home computers of that period. These machines were perfectly capable of producing fairly high-resolution & multi-color graphics (all relative), yet most systems booted into an interactive prompt with the so-called textmode as de-facto standard environment, providing a level, if also limited, playing field for the creation of text-based graphics from a patchwork of characters & symbols of a predefined font (system or custom). As is so often the case, limitation is the mother of invention and the regular, monospaced grid and standardized set of characters quickly encouraged an entire subculture of specialized designers & artists to emerge (which is currently being re-discovered & remixed by younger generations), applying & showcasing their creativity (with often surprisingly ingenious skills) in the form of game designs, user interfaces, disk mags, demoscene productions, competitions, flyers, BBSes and even various early Web designs of the mid/late 90s.\n\nASCII-SCAPE is an attempted non-nostalgic homage to these roots & culture. It is also a textmode-only (no canvas!) rework of my previous piece C-SCAPE. It combines my love of cellular automata with the stripped back aesthetics & limitations of using only text as representation medium of these co-evolving generative systems. It required an almost complete rewrite & re-curation of various elements: 1200+ new handpicked rule combinations, 32 character sets, 40 color themes, new relationships & biases to better manage the resulting textures, densities and contrast.\n\nAlthough technically not strictly \"ASCII\" (an actual standard, but also a popular shorthand for \"text only\"), the entire simulation only uses various Unicode characters and the beautiful Iosevka open source typeface by Renzhi Li aka Belleve Invis.\n\nLike its parent C-SCAPE, this project is dynamic and evolves indefinitely. It's best viewed on non-mobile devices, where there's a decent horizontal resolution to provide sufficient simulation space. Please see the C-SCAPE project description for further details. There's no graphical export feature, but output can be captured into an UTF-8 plain text file (max. 100k lines/generations).\n\nThe following keyboard shortcuts are available:\n\n- space : toggle simulation updates (pause/play)\n- r : randomize environment\n- x : start/stop recording\n- f : toggle scroll speed (fast/slow)\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nIosevka typeface licensed under OFL-1.1 license\n\nhttps://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and https://thi.ng",

Inspired by Wiederrecht’s mastery of line and Vittoria’s notable palette, this 1/1/250 series captures the present moment. It serves as a reminder that we are more similar than we are different, leveraging homogeneous shapes to create distinctive compositions.\n\nVittoria’s poem for the collection:\n\n“In Due Time”\nWe will all become\nParticles dancing\nAcross the skyline.\n\nThe artwork listed is indeed authentic, created by, and copyright to artists Melissa Wiederrecht and Amber Vittoria; the purchase of this NFT is a purchase of the asset, not of the copyright.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTo save a high-resolution image for printing, click “open” under the image on the page for your token, and then hit:\n\nDigits “1” through “9” to get an image that is 1000 through 9000px tall.  This may take a while, depending on the size and your computer, so please be patient.",

            "description": "Decadence should not be misunderstood. Over time, the word has had various meanings (political and cultural) but has also been associated with Symbolism and Aestheticism.\n\nThe contemporary definition of decadence emerged in the late 19th century and praised artifice over nature, sophistication over simplicity, at the same time defying contemporary discourse of decline by embracing subjects and styles that critics considered over-refined. \n\nNowadays, decadence also refers to stagnation and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of material prosperity and technological development which leads to an excessive indulgence in pleasure or luxury.\n\nIn this context, Decadence is a reflection on the collaboration between Jerome Herr and David Mrugala (thedotisblack). A collaboration that started several months ago with a simple grid of random values, that soon became an experiment of creativity, always in the search of expectations, interest in excessive indulgence of visual pleasure, a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged in a series of generative images with an aesthetics that values excess – That is Decadence.\n\n- press 's' to save a standard image\n- press 'h' to save a high resolution image\n\nJerome Herr\n\nJerome Herr is from Luxembourg. Since 2015 he has created generative art with a passion for design and visual explorations. He is an active member of the creative coding community and a successful NFT artist, both on Teia and Fxhash.\n\nDavid Mrugala\n\nDavid is a German architect and intermedia artist, who lives in South Korea. He is the founder of thedotisblack, a platform and an archive for research design on (generative) drawings and animations made with code.",

So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\nBecause this is an NFT in PFP format, you can put it on your avatar on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nDesigned by: @morteza_yousefy\nMade in 2022",

So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\nBecause this is an NFT in PFP format, you can put it on your avatar on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nDesigned by: @morteza_yousefy\nMade in 2022\n\n\n",

            "description": "Take your entire life, full as it is with the vastness of your lived experiences – and shape it into your cupped hands. Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",

So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\nBecause this is an NFT in PFP format, you can put it on your avatar on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nDesigned by: @morteza_yousefy\nMade in 2022\n\n\n",
