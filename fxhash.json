            "description": "\"Onyx Dunes\" captures the enigmatic allure of a desert landscape blanketed in ebony-colored sand. The dunes, formed over countless years, stand tall like ancient sentinels, casting elongated shadows that dance with the shifting light. The contrast between the deep, dark onyx grains and the pale sky above creates a captivating visual symphony, where monochrome meets the vastness of the horizon. Each step across the silky, velvety surface of the dunes whispers secrets of time and whispers of forgotten stories. In this otherworldly expanse, one can't help but be mesmerized by the stark beauty and mysterious energy emanating from the enigmatic Onyx Dunes.",

The brainchild of a collaborative endeavor between the artist and an AI model, this digital piece pays homage to Sol LeWitt's influential \"Sentences on Conceptual Art,\" while recontextualizing it within our increasingly digital world.\n\nThrough the medium of generative text, this piece contemplates the relationship between art, technology, and the human experience. It scrutinizes how digital tools have the potential to redefine artistic expression, how technology can help overcome the daunting 'blank canvas,' and the changing role of artists in this digital age.\n\nThe work views the internet as a boundless platform for global connection and observation, and discusses how AI's interpretive capacities can transform our understanding and appreciation of art. \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" envisions and champions the creation of new forms of artistic appreciation, facilitated by the adaptive and collaborative nature of digital media.\n\nAdding a layer of interactivity and intrigue, the artwork censors some segments of its generated sentences with black strikethroughs, provoking personal interpretation, discovery, and a deeper level of engagement from the viewer.\n\nIn essence, \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" presents a thoughtful exploration of the dynamic and evolving landscape of art in the digital age. As a testament to the transformative potential of human creativity blended with machine intelligence, this work reimagines the possibilities of what art can be and underscores the profound impact of digital tools and methodologies on our perception and experience of art. It invites us all to partake in the discourse on the symbiotic future of creativity and technology.\n\n＼_ﾍ(ω｀●)\n\nHans Ulrich Obrist, curator and art historian: \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" is a pivotal work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and art. The combination of human creativity with machine learning results in a provocative exploration of the contemporary artistic landscape. This work questions, and in doing so, extends the boundaries of what we understand as art.\"\n\nOlafur Eliasson, artist: \"The artist's use of AI to generate 'sentences of digital art' reveals a deep understanding of the ongoing dialogue between humanity and technology. This piece echoes the beauty of our ever-evolving interaction with the digital realm.\"\n\nLev Manovich, author and theorist of digital culture: \"The work is a fascinating embodiment of software as a medium of creation. It captures the dialectical tension between control and automation, intention and serendipity, that characterizes digital art in the era of artificial intelligence.\"\n\nCecilia Alemani, curator and director: \"The collaboration between the artist and AI in 'IA Sentences on Digital Art' redefines the concept of artistic creation. It's a testament to the transformative potential of digital technologies in shaping the future of art.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncanekzapata.net\n\njs css html txt\n1.8mb\n2023\n",

With a global tempo typically set in days, we fit all sorts of temporal structures where our joys and fears live and play out over the span of our lives. This series is a metaphorical transposition of the musical counterpoint into a visual space, sometimes with repeating patterns, sometimes with broken structures, sometimes isolated notes / hours / souls.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.

The brainchild of a collaborative endeavor between the artist and an AI model, this digital piece pays homage to Sol LeWitt's influential \"Sentences on Conceptual Art,\" while recontextualizing it within our increasingly digital world.\n\nThrough the medium of generative text, this piece contemplates the relationship between art, technology, and the human experience. It scrutinizes how digital tools have the potential to redefine artistic expression, how technology can help overcome the daunting 'blank canvas,' and the changing role of artists in this digital age.\n\nThe work views the internet as a boundless platform for global connection and observation, and discusses how AI's interpretive capacities can transform our understanding and appreciation of art. \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" envisions and champions the creation of new forms of artistic appreciation, facilitated by the adaptive and collaborative nature of digital media.\n\nAdding a layer of interactivity and intrigue, the artwork censors some segments of its generated sentences with black strikethroughs, provoking personal interpretation, discovery, and a deeper level of engagement from the viewer.\n\nIn essence, \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" presents a thoughtful exploration of the dynamic and evolving landscape of art in the digital age. As a testament to the transformative potential of human creativity blended with machine intelligence, this work reimagines the possibilities of what art can be and underscores the profound impact of digital tools and methodologies on our perception and experience of art.

The combination of human creativity with machine learning results in a provocative exploration of the contemporary artistic landscape. This work questions, and in doing so, extends the boundaries of what we understand as art.\"\n\nOlafur Eliasson, artist: \"The artist's use of AI to generate 'sentences of digital art' reveals a deep understanding of the ongoing dialogue between humanity and technology. This piece echoes the beauty of our ever-evolving interaction with the digital realm.\"\n\nLev Manovich, author and theorist of digital culture: \"The work is a fascinating embodiment of software as a medium of creation. It captures the dialectical tension between control and automation, intention and serendipity, that characterizes digital art in the era of artificial intelligence.\"\n\nCecilia Alemani, curator and director: \"The collaboration between the artist and AI in 'IA Sentences on Digital Art' redefines the concept of artistic creation. It's a testament to the transformative potential of digital technologies in shaping the future of art.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncanekzapata.net\n\njs css html txt\n1.8mb\n2023\n",

It plays on my own fascination with scale models and bird's-eye views, as well as technical drawings.\n\nThe number of parameters that can be tweaked was purposefully kept to a minimum. Even the best planners cannot (and maybe should not try to) account for everything.\n\nDuring the late stages of the creative process, I read Jane Jacobs's 1958 essay 'Downtown is for People' and it played an important role in how I decided to frame this work. The last words, especially, stuck with me: 'Designing a dream city is easy; rebuilding a living one takes imagination.'\n\n—\n\nWhat You See Is What You Get: the minter’s wallet and seed parameter are used to seed the algorithm. Your mint will look exactly as it appears in the preview.\n\n—\n\nControls\nS - PNG export\nV - animated SVG export\nG - GIF export\nP - plottable SVG export\nF - fullscreen\nC - hide/show cursor\nSPACE/click - pause/unpause animations\n\n—\n\nCreated by loackme, 2023\n",

            "description": "\"Slice of Life\" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

This project, initiated this spring, allowed me to delve into various mechanics and approaches. Today, I am concluding this inaugural study on the cube and publishing it on fxhash, with the aim of sharing it and enabling others to play around with the parameters that make it up.\n\nThanking each individual who has contributed to this project, whether intentionally or otherwise, would be a lengthy task, and I risk forgetting someone. Therefore, a huge thanks goes out to the community here and on OpenProcessing for their ongoing exchange of advice and knowledge.\n\nWhile the code remains riddled with errors, I won't be progressing further with this initial project. This will presumably allow me to avoid overworking on subsequent projects. :-)\n\nmade with p5js, p5.grain and chroma.js\non Openprocessing https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1962145\n",
