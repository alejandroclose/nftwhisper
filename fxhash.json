Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

Here we divide a space in Voronoi cells, extrude the defined polygons in 3D, and then rotate them along one of the polygon's sides.\nI was doing research on materials and lighting when I tried this and thought it had some generative merits, and then I heard of the event, so I decided to create a generator with it.\nAll the colors/tints come from the lights, environment and material properties, the volume themselves are always \"white\".\n\nBest enjoyed on desktop / Chrome.\n\n!!! Be sure the check the menu that you can find by clicking/tapping the BUTTON in the TOP LEFT !!!\nIn this menu you'll find some options to customize and experience the artwork, as well as the exports menu.\n\n!!! TO EXPORT CLEAN HIGH RESOLUTION CAPTURES, click the \"EXPORTS\" button in the menu, select your desired resolution then click the \"START CAPTURE\" button. This only works when the generator is running in its own window, so be sure to click the \"OPEN\" button.\n\n2024 - Christophe Ulu Choffel\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0\nSee LICENSE.txt for full details",

Intrigued by this challenge, I've delved deep into the pixels of this issue. 🙂\n\nDrawing inspiration from Rev Dan Catt’s 'Tally!' and applying similar principles of Cable Management, I've assembled a fun and free OE project.\n\nThis project dynamically evolves with each iteration.Grid is determined by a random value calculated as follows: the lower bound starts at 3 and increases incrementally with every 100 iterations, while the upper bound starts at 4 and increases with every 30 iterations. In practical terms, as the iteration count increases, both the minimum and maximum possible number of cols&rows gradually increase.\n\n3200x3200px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

            "description": "\".printing\" will become one of the redeemable gifts for \".printed\" holders.\n\nNow, let's explore the merits of expressing art in the digital realm versus the realm of printed art.\n\nOne significant point, in my opinion, is the difference in the colors achievable through CMYK and RGB. This also leads to variations in texture.\nIn \".printed\" I have opted for a format where colors are selected from a designated palette. This decision is influenced by the limitations of the CMYK color gamut for printing, but it's also driven by a conscious choice to use colors like yellow, white, and black shades that evoke a sense of glossiness and beauty when printed.\nIn this instance of \".printing\" the wide range from #000000 to #ffffff is available for selection, based on the display's color reproduction. The ability for the minter, rather than the artist, to freely choose and combine colors adds an intriguing aspect unique to the params system.\n\nAnother key distinction lies in capturing a fleeting moment of fondness versus capturing an ongoing movement within the framework of code. Unlike GIFs or video files, the necessity for this art to be expressed through code, specifically p5js, is emphasized by the temporal changes brought about by noise(). The patterns in this piece possess reproducibility through a seed, yet theoretically, they continue to transform infinitely.\n\nThis project stands as a significant milestone in my personal exploration of the regular variations in noise function.The pattern of this project is not perfectly symmetrical.\n\nIn \"printed\" there's the joy of selecting a moment inherent to physical objects, coupled with a glossy texture.\n\nIn \"printing\" the temporal evolution offered by p5js noise() function intertwines with a palette of 16,777,216 colors.\n\nI hope you find enjoyment in both aspects.\n\nGenerative art by @dotconatus\n\nBuilt in Javascript with p5.js.",

Here we divide a space in Voronoi cells, extrude the defined polygons in 3D, and then rotate them along one of the polygon's sides.\nI was doing research on materials and lighting when I tried this and thought it had some generative merits, and then I heard of the event, so I decided to create a generator with it.\nAll the colors/tints come from the lights, environment and material properties, the volume themselves are always \"white\".\n\nBest enjoyed on desktop / Chrome.\n\n!!! Be sure the check the menu that you can find by clicking/tapping the BUTTON in the TOP LEFT !!!\nIn this menu you'll find some options to customize and experience the artwork, as well as the exports menu.\n\n!!! TO EXPORT CLEAN HIGH RESOLUTION CAPTURES, click the \"EXPORTS\" button in the menu, select your desired resolution then click the \"START CAPTURE\" button. This only works when the generator is running in its own window, so be sure to click the \"OPEN\" button.\n\n2024 - Christophe Ulu Choffel\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0\nSee LICENSE.txt for full details",
