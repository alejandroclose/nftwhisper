            "description": "There is no light without dark.\n\nLuminaries is a study in symmetry, contrast and flow, with a palette inspired by the twelve full moon names. Owning a Luminary enables you to request a signed print for an additional fee. \n\nYou can learn more about features and prints at: https://www.phaust.art/luminary\n\nEach Luminary is composed of moons in various phases. Their layout derived from a handful of geometries. They contrast with their surroundings: filled with glittering stars, inky strokes or solid colour. \n\nBackgrounds can split along lines of symmetry – with dark and light contrasting as strokes seamlessly flow across the two halves. \n\nLuminaries are alive. They’re in retrograde once a month, a day in which you’ll see yours in a new light.\n\n------\n\nCollection Size: 158. One for each of the confirmed moons in our solar system.\n\nPalettes: 12 + 1. One for each of the full moons plus a rarer secret palette: Wolf, Snow, Worm, Pink, Flower, Strawberry, Buck, Sturgeon, Harvest, Hunter, Beaver, Cold, ????.\n\nRetrograde: day of the month that your Luminary will change for one day only.\n\nS: to save at high resolution. \n\nPrints: request from https://www.phaust.art/luminary",

Inspired by childhood memories that passed through the watercolor sketches of my mother, who was an artist, the piece reflects my admiration for her work and her influence on my own artistic endeavors. \nIntricate forms contrast with the strict forms of cells. All these are echoes from childhood - watercolor lines of a child not bothered by a special artistic idea but trying at least to a fraction of mastering the fine arts and cubes reminiscent of ones which children use to build towers.\nOverall, the piece is a tribute to the joy and creativity of childhood, and to the power of artistic inspiration that can be passed down from one generation to the next.\n\nMade with p5js and a few GLSL shaders.

The collection presents a visual representation of the struggles, doubts, and triumphs of recognizing our own value. Each piece delves into different aspects of ourselves and how they contribute to this feeling.\n\nThe seemingly chaotic yet orderly arrangement of the shapes in this collection reflects the tumultuous nature of the human experience. It speaks to the push and pull of self-doubt and the struggle to acknowledge one's own worth, while the raw and unrefined nature of the collection reflects the brutal reality of the human experience.\n\nA hidden harmony beneath the surface represents the truth that we are all enough, just as we are. The collection invites the viewer to look within and acknowledge their own struggles and triumphs and to find comfort in the realization that the feeling of being enough is always present, like an echo that lingers. \n\nIt is a reminder that we are enough, just as we are.\n\n\n\nThe artwork is fully created in javascript with the p5js library. \nThe ideal viewing resolution is 1000x1000, and the artwork can be scaled to any size/resolution.
