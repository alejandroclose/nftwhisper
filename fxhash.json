            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

A key characteristic of these systems is that the initial parameters are simple but the resulting process can be extremely complex. In LandWaves, pixel colours affect each other, line by line, from top to bottom. Frequencies of multiple oscillating sound waves are turning the brightness values of these pixels into sonic materia. \n\nThis piece started as an experimentation in gallery spaces, then transformed over several different digital ecosystems, questioning their hyper-capitalist nature and mediated affordance.\n\nTouch to listen",

            "description": "Ries is 500 sheets of paper. \nRies is an cut-up text-artwork.\nRies is artwork generated by an algorithm based on seeded random numbers.\nRies is a digital artwork installed in 5 forms in exhibitions setting.\nRies is an NFT artwork. \n\nRies is an artwork where I try bring together my experience of doing gallery exhibitions, my love for generative and copy machine art, DIY-punk aesthetics, NFT’s and chaos. \n\nThe edition of Ries will be installed in different forms and collages in a gallery exhibition in Walden Kunstaustellungen in Berlin in July of 2022. Opening is at 8.7. 19.00, welcome if you are in Berlin.\n/www.galerie-walden.de/\n\nThe seed idea for the project was the method of cut-up where a text (or something else) is cut into pieces and then rearranged to form something new. A modified Markov’s Chain algorithm makes a small text or a group of words from a pool of texts that include Art texts about cut up technique and generative art talk from tweets. These words form a visual bottom layer and then another layer of words samples the first, cutting it up and thus following the theme of the artwork.\n\nSince the single iterations of the project are designed to be used in a collage, they come in various tone, density, detail and scale. One can test from the variations button and get a sense of what the generator produces. \n\nControls in live view:\n-Pressing  j exports the current image as jpeg\n-Pressing  p  exports the current image as png\n\nTo change the detail level one can access the pixel density of render by adding ?pixDens=4 to the end of the URL in live view. You can of course you any number other than 4 also. I it renders just a black image, you have to lower the number, since it is then too large for WEBGL to render.\n\nDesigned to be best rendered on desktop Chrome.\n\nPricing info\n22 tez - Includes a gallery shown, signed print sent to minter by mail or by telefax(!)\n11 tez - A fair price for an artwork, also the minter can personally pick up a signed gallery shown print from the gallery, after the exhibition.\n5 tez - 1/2 fair price\n2 tez - bottom dollar\n\nIf you minted on lower tiers and would want a print, please contact the artist per twitter dm to “upgrade”. If you bought secondary, and would want a print, please contact the artist per twitter dm.\n\nFeatures exist mostly to help with artwork pairing for the collectors.\n\n\nMarkov’s chain code core is based on Markov Me! By https://codepen.io/alexkramerbanjo , MIT License\n\nDisplacement shader based on the wonderful shader examples by Adam Ferris\n\n\nThe artist holds the right to use the whole edition of Ries for display purposes for future exhibitions without asking permission or notifying the owners of the NFT’s.\n\n1.7.2022 in Berlin\nAntti Pussinen\n\nwww.anttipussinen.net\nwww.twitter.com/antti_pussinen\nwww.instagram.com/anttipussinen\n",

The Sobel operator provides both the magnitude and direction of the gradient, one is used to highlight edges, the other to achieve a shading effect.\n\nThe main parameters for the animation can be chosen with the fx(params) interface.\nThe minted iterations will differ as the noise generation is seeded via fxrand().\n\nThe animation can be rendered in fullscreen at 16/9, 9/16, or 1/1 aspect ratio.\n\nRequires WebGl compatible browsers.\n\n\nParameters\n----------\nPalette\n- select palette\nNoise Scale\n- zoom in the noise field\nFBM Octaves\n- choose how much octaves in the FBM [4, 5, 6, 7]\nSpeed\n- speed of animation\nWarp Kind\n- select the warping method [five kind]\nCoeff.
