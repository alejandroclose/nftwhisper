We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state. Press \"h\" to save it.\n\nUninhabitable is an original work by Iskra Velitchkova. 2021.",

            "description": "The second piece in this series is dedicated to another fundamental algorithm in computer graphics: Voronoi. It's origin precedes its use with computers by several decades, or centuries, depending on who to credit, since science always is a continuum. In the generative art & design field, the algorithm has been an instrumental tool for generation(s) of practioners, sadly often to the point of turning cliché.\n\nIn this piece I've attempted to \"break\" the classic resulting aesthetics of this algorithm and focus more on revealing its inner workings. There are many ways of computing a Voronoi diagram. The so called Jump Flood Algorithm (JFA) proved to be the visually most interesting approach to me. Again, as with the previous De/Frag piece, here the algorithm has been slowed down, timesliced and customized in dozens of ways to result in a more painterly character overall and produce a variety of new shapes & textures.\n\nFullscreen compatible (Press 'S' to toggle square frame).

Sliders?\n\n\n“Pensado a mano” explores the intersection of Generative Art and Hand Drawing. The collector, by drawing a predefined number of shapes on canvas, creates a unique hand-crafted seed that generates the final artwork. That is the only customisable param, thought by hand, which interacts with various random attributes to produce a unique composition.\n\n“…the time we spend doing and making things, the process…”\n\nAnd yet the process continues. On the background, the code generates a plottable svg.\nAn artificially extended process, from hand to screen, from screen to paper, that creates a new kind of mixed media.\n\nSigned plots will soon be claimable via Artfora (tbd price + shipping)\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1 - Draw the requested shapes and wait to see the result. You can change the Seed Nr. slider if you don't like the selected mode.\n2 - Press “C” to copy drawing to Clipboard\n3 - Copy the clipboard contents to the text-input on the fx(params) sidebar\n\n***Important. If you buy several tickets, make sure you don't mint the same Seed Nr. twice (slider)\n\npress “S” to save the PNG, press “P” to plot the SVG\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis is a high-supply token minted during a bear market.

During this time, I have released more than 160 separate collections. I am also extremely grateful to all collectors, authors, designers and artists whom I met during this time. You are wonderful people. Once again I want to express my gratitude to everyone who minted my work and help financially in such a difficult time. Each coin is very important and has played a critical role in my life.\n\nThis collection has a final cost of 0 XTZ. If suddenly you like the minted work and you want to express your gratitude, you can write to me on Twitter, retweet or mint any other work from my profile. Only at your request.\n\nMade with p5.js ",
