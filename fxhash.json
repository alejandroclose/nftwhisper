            "description": "\"Opposites are not contradictory but complementary.\" - Niels Bohr\n\nThe concept of yin and yang is an ancient philosophy about how opposing forces are not only complementary but actually give rise to each other. This idea reverberates through nature, art, and life itself. Now it is at the heart of modern physics. Perhaps this is a fundamental law of nature baked into the very fabric of existence.\n\nAntiflow is an exploration of how balanced complexity can arise from chaos by harnessing the dynamic interplay of opposing forces. To that end we were inspired to create this wildly unique set by mixing modern physics concepts with abstract expressionism and retro 3D primitives.\n\nThe aspect ratio is 3:2 to facilitate poster size prints and device wallpapers. Results are presented without borders, noise, or other effects to allow for maximum detail. Feel free to rotate in whatever direction you choose for the best display.\n\nPress \"S\" to save at a higher definition.",

Check out nouns.wtf for more info.\n\nThey make for fun social media banners when cropped, if you wanna show off you fandom of Nouns.\n\nC : Clear screen and start animation over\nS : Save current image\n1 -> 6 : Set pixel density to the respective number\n\nSo, if you want a high resolution file, tap `6` for it to redraw, and then `S` to save. You can also save while it's animating if you like, which is fun too.",

            "description": "The preparations for the first mission began in 2142. It had become clear that mining petroleum on Earth would soon become financially unfeasible, so looking to other planets was the only logical choice. It took seventeen more years to perfect the technology so that the first colonists could reach Proxima b within the lifetime of one generation.\n\nAfter 45 years of travelling at almost one-tenth of the speed of light, they reached their new home. It was rich in petrochemicals but scarce in the nutrients necessary for long term human survival. After merely six generations, humanity was forced to travel once again in search of a new world. The four missions that parted from the Proxima system to colonise other possibly habitable planets in the galaxy sparked a new age of human civilisation that would never see itself united and thriving again.\n\nEventually, all the colonies became independent societies as their differing interests drove them apart. Each small civilisation chose its path, wandering the void of space alone. Over time, millions of kilometres apart, each colony developed its own culture and traditions. While their habits and customs changed, some things remained the same across all the societies, like how it became a certain tradition to convert the outer world years and days to Earth time and celebrate holidays according to the calendar of the old world.\n\nThe new nomads learned from the first pilgrims. They used the technology once optimised for oil extraction to traverse other worlds, searching for sustenance. Peculiar wandering nonspaces emerged from the involuntary degrowth of human civilisation.\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image.\n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution.

In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

            "description": "Cellular Automata are one of the oldest and simplest classes of generative systems. Beginning with the highly abstracted, reductionist models of artificial life research by Stanislav Ulam and John von Neumann in the 1940s, Barricelli in the early 1950s, then re-discovered, formalized, expanded and popularized by other mathematicians like Conway and Wolfram 20-30 years later, it's a long-running field of research, rich with unexpected surprises and new discoveries. C-SCAPE is (a partial) result of over 20 years of my own explorations and a celebration of these simple systems.\n\nMost of my purely generative work has been about creating and harnessing emergent complexity & nonrepetitve, ever-changing behaviors (and their interactions) borne from extremely simple systems, mechanisms, algorithms & languages: Exposing, investigating (and yes, celebrating) generativity in its raw form. By minimizing, though not entirely avoiding, additional human aesthetic decision making (here primarily in the form of curating automata rules & color themes), I'm trying to focus the observer on the raw beauty of the underlying processes and bring it to the fore. My hope is, this too will lead viewers asking themselves the deeper questions about the nature of rules, behavior, order and complexity in their own lives, esp. in the current rising polarizing political & anti-science climate. Furthermore, I'd like to provide a counter point and emphasize the unique qualities of generative art, compared to other, more figurative and abstract art approaches.\n\nC-SCAPE simulates a shared toroidal environment in which multiple cellular automata (CA) are evolving and influencing each other, forming short-lived symbioses and/or wiping each other out, only to be restored again later on. The automata are all operating on a single row of pixels at a time and therefore are only 1-dimensional. Yet, many of them also have a short term memory and can produce more complex structures/behaviors by utilizing their memory of previous cell states. Each individually minted version produces a unique system which evolves over time and never repeats.\n\nThe final selection of CA rules used in this piece is the result of many years of experimentation with 100,000s of different configurations and many (manual) review/pruning/cataloging sessions to encourage the minted editions to cover a interesting & balanced subset of the more than duodecillion (10^39) possible individual structures & textures (not including interactions and/or color variations)...\n\nViewing\n\nThe piece in best viewed in medium/high resolution landscape format. The horizontal resolution should be at the very least 800 pixels, preferably double that or higher. There's a max. pixel resolution limit of 4096 pixels in either direction, but CPU performance might suffer at these resolutions. On narrow/mobile portrait ratios the piece will be shown 90 degrees rotated and is scrolling sideways.\n\nControls\n\n- x : export current frame\n- r : randomize environment\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and thi.ng",

            "description": "There’s so much more to our world than what we are able to perceive, let alone understand. Will we ever be able to even fully understand ourselves?\n\n–\n\nElevation is a series of 320 generative elevation drawings of imaginary structures. It is a reminder of the limits of our consciousness, and an ode to the manifold nuances that lie beyond what we can perceive, beyond what we even can imagine.\n\nAs a generative artist, I aim to elevate my own consciousness with the help of the machine. I welcome algorithms and randomness into the creation of my works, taking full control, and intentionally giving it away, always seeking to expand my imagination. For as humans alone, we remain limited to our own edifice of thought, and often fail to free ourselves from the visible, mundane world.\n\nBoth are present in Elevation: the visible and the imaginary, the mundane and the transcendent, the solid and the fragile. Where an architect’s elevation drawing marks the transition from the thought world into the visible world, Elevation remains in-between, depicting both the idea of an imaginary structure, and the structure itself.\n\n–\n\nElevation is intended for print.

            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

            "description": "The Corium is a roughly spherical mass (diameter ~1km), of currently unknown origins situated within the core region of the solar system's asteroid belt.\nThe body was discovered during a uranium extraction mission undertaken by ET Resources at the behest of Station 733-H (Mars colony) leadership, when ionising radiation levels detected by deployed surface craft exceeded equipment and personnel tolerance levels by many orders of magnitude.\n\nWhile ETR crew were quick to respond to local abort orders (27 minutes from initial readings to fleet reorientation); Station 733-H made the determination that radiation exposure levels were already far in excess of anything that could be reasonably mitigated upon the ETR fleet's return.\nThe ETR fleet was ordered to jettison fuel reserves under Section 9 of the Space Corporations Act (Mars) approximately 90 minutes after the readings were initially reported. It is understood that all deployed personnel accessed their barbiturate rations within the following 24 hours.\n\nThe fleet itself remains in position some ~3000kms from The Corium, with plans to relocate the vessels still underway (albeit a low priority).\n\n\nSTATION 733-H OBSERVATION REPORT SUMMARY (14.1.1)\n\nTo date, remote analysis suggests that the body is compositionally similar to corium deposits observed following terrestrial nuclear disasters, consisting of a range of solidified radioactive compounds as well as a number of currently unidentified metal alloys. More in-depth analysis has been impossible to date due to the rapid physical decay of personnel and equipment as their proximity to samples reach a critical threshold.\n\nAll samples have so far been extruded from the surface of The Corium via laser, and maneuvered into orbit around Mars at the edge of it's sphere of influence (at a distance of no less than 50,000kms from Station 733-H), via projectile barrage and gas envelopment.\n\nThe surface of The Corium itself is littered with an array of clearly engineered forms; radial and rectangular patterns, deep crevasses, mazes and grids with only a select few areas resembling the pools of lava observed where Corium has formed terrestrially (it is unclear whether these deposits have formed since the surface was initially engineered).\n\nThe accompanying files are LIDAR renders of the extracted samples in proximity to Station 733-H and are marked for dissemination to terrestrial research teams on Mars. Study of The Corium remains the sole priority of Station 733-H research personnel, as any risks presented to the solar system or its inhabitants are currently not well understood.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe piece will render from the top right and might take ~5-10 seconds to begin.\n\nAppend \"&print=true\" to the live render URL for a hi-res output.",

            "description": "Gerhard is a collaboration of Richard Nadler and Leander Herzog on fxhash. A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time. \nRichard Nadler created the textures to control composition and color. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels. This collaboration is enabled by twitter and fxhash, as the generative art community continues to explore abstraction in summer 2022 – while extreme temperatures, wildfires, ongoing conflicts and volatile markets continue to escalate. \n\n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color. \n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen mode. \n- Press “s” to save the current canvas. \n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nhttps://leanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/",

The unnatural drawing order and chromatic differences of the individual faces sometimes yields illusory or paradoxical visual geometries.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png.
