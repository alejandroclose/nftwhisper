Searching for the possibility of depicting this rhythm, texture, and space opens this opportunity as a new experience for me. And how can I convert time to image? In this work, I have depicted the circle of wandering, like the sun that fluctuates in every horizon and climate, sometimes hot and tense and sometimes its rays like the morning breeze caressing our face, calling us to a new beginning.

The seemingly lonely scenery can often reflect the noble sentiment of the literati. In this work, I create a poetic, raining scenery by p5.js. I also reproduce the ink rhythm and texture strokes pattern left by the brush on the rice paper.
