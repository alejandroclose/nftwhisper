            "description": "I had a wonderful childhood. I grew up near a big lake, in a house with a huge garden. You could get lost for the whole day, building houses on trees, collecting flowers and stones or stealing food from the vegetable garden. Having a brother of the same age made things even better, endless adventures with somebody saving you every time you are too dumb to realize you are walking into troubles.\n\nWe enjoyed the summers with the hot days, the fireflies and the nights full of falling stars. The winters with the snow, the stalactites and our box turtle disappearing for months to then reappear in the spring (Until she did not).\n\nAt the same time, taking care of the garden was a big responsibility, affecting our family life in many ways. Numerous times, I felt like the efforts we were putting in to keep it in order were never enough and nature was always faster in restoring her point of view. A struggle that affects us humans since we started to bend nature at our will, thousands of years ago.\n\nIn my gardens, I tried to capture this struggle, this constant fight to shape nature at our will.\nHowever, I also tried to represent the beauty that can be found in both savage and human shaped nature, if shaped with love and respect.\n\nI dedicate this project to my grandfather, who gave us a garden.\nI am sure he would have loved it.\n\n---\n\nHand coded with love and obsession. 💚\n\nPowered by p5, p5.createLoop and chroma.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\nPress ‘m’ to open a menu with the available outputs.\n\nThe generation of a hi-res image, up to 8000x8000, takes a few seconds.\nThe generation of an Animated GIF takes several minutes and the save command works only once the GIF is complete.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters that can be used to load different configurations.\n\n- mode = 0 | 1\n0 For static PNG images, 1 for animated GIFs\n\n- size = s | m | l\nThe Size of the output, 1080x1080, 4000x4000, 8000x8000 for static images and 512x512, 800x800, 1080x1080 for animated GIFs\n\n- fps = 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30\nFrames per second of animated GIFs\n\n=============> PROFILES <==============\n\t\nWeeds ------------------> 42%\nShapes -----------------> 7%\nFlower Power -----------> 5%\nStrips -----------------> 5%\nBadlands ---------------> 5%\nCircle Flower Packing --> 5%\nIna's Farm -------------> 5%\nFortified Pond ---------> 3%\nFalling Into You -------> 3%\nCultivar ---------------> 2%\nThe Hedge --------------> 2%\nRocky Mountains --------> 2%\nUnreachable Rivers -----> 2%\nMushrooms Heaven -------> 2%\nDante ------------------> 1.75%\nAcid Lands -------------> 1.75%\nProvence ---------------> 1.5%\nThe Springs ------------> 1.25%\nSecret Garden ----------> 1%\nThe Pump ---------------> 1%\nTetris -----------------> 1%\nThe Spiral -------------> 0.5%\nKinetic Sculpture ------> 0.25%\n\nInsects are visible only in the animated outputs.\n\n=============> MAKING OF <=============\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/article/the-making-of-noisy-gardens\n\n---",

They live a cyclical life marked by two big stages during their livestock year: \"La Veranada\" and \"La Invernada\".\nThe \"invernada\" is the place where they live during what we could call the long winter, that is, from April to November. \"La Invernada\" is below, in the plains, in the pampas, in accessible places, where it is easy to supply the animals with fodder.\n\"La Veranada\" is the place where they go during the long summer, from November to April, it is above, in the mountain ranges, on the heights, where the summer pastures abound, where they go for months to take care, alone, of the goats, cows and calves.\nThe transfer of the animals to the summer pasture is called \"Arreo\", my mother's husband guides the animals on his horse. The \"Arreo\" lasts about 5 days.\nIn both places they live in what they call \"el puesto\". \"El puesto\" is their home.\nIn \"La veranada\", \"El puesto\" is simple. A common living room, with a wood stove, a table, some chairs and shelves to store flour, *\"mate\" and salt. A small bedroom replenishes the strength worn out by the daily work. Water for drinking, cooking and washing is drawn from a nearby stream.\nWork is abundant. As a common element, both in winter and summer, my mother's husband rides a horse daily and, accompanied by his dogs, goes to \"watch\" the cattle.\nAs a final point I wanted to thank you for taking your time and reading the story behind this project that I really enjoyed doing it, and on my tw profile you can read this story with real photos.\n\n*Mate: is an Argentinean infusion, which is present all day long in the life of people who live in the countryside. It give you energy.\n\nPress \"S\" in live mode to save image 2600 x 3000.\nPlease note that the algorithm can take some time to run.\nCreated by Fernando. NFT License 2.0.",

The legend in the bottom right can be used to decipher which color means what.\n\nThis artwork was created using p5js.\n\nThe artwork adapts to different screen sizes and ratios, so I exploring it on various devices or resizing your browser window. \n\nFeatures:\n\n- Circle Size: What size are the circles?\n- Circle Distance: How far apart from each other are the circles?\n- Circle Scatter: Are the circles scattered on the Y-axis?\n\ntwitter: @ada_ada_ada_art",

The resemblance to ferrofluids and organic \"cells\" leads to interesting and almost hypnotic visual effects that evolve indefinitely.\n\nBlack and white is the most common feature but there are 5 more colour palettes possible. The parameters are hand picked and selected randomly from a pool, every drop is unique.\n\nPress,\n\"s\" to save a screenshot in 4k\n\"p\" to switch to black and white\n\"space\" to pause\n\"left arrow\" to step back\n\"right arrow\" to step forward\n\nOriginal artwork by William Watkins · Lyon, 2022",
