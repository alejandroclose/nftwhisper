At what point do you feel the dots begin to dissolve into a texture? When do you stop noticing the dots and instead begin to perceive the overall composition?\n\nThese questions are posed in a similar fashion as with meditation; at what point does something become something else? When does an in-breath become an out-breath and vice versa? \n\nContemplation on simple questions like these can open a small portal into stillness and mindfulness by taking time to slowly observe our responses. \n\n23 palettes are included, each named after different areas of Tokyo. \n\nPress 'S' to download a full size 6000px x 6000px PNG output. \n\nAs always, much gratitude and enjoy your piece.

            "description": "Square Planets was inspired by a series of OP Art paintings done by Victor Vasarely, called Planetary Folklore Participations No. 2. (c. 1970). Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the third in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nSquare Planets consists of four layers of squares contained within a background square superimposed on top of one another. Each layer is translated from the previous layer but still lies within its boundaries. The background color of each layer is random and its set of squares are another random color. The squares that make up layers two and three are rotated either clockwise or counter-clockwise some random number of degrees within a predetermined range. \n\nThere are many Gestalt interactions within this piece. Layers (square planets) interact with each other in interesting ways. Each new generation with its random color assignments significantly affect your depth perception. Layers appear to come forward or recede. Sometimes there is more \"after-imagism\" between the square sets. Candy for your mind.",

            "description": "The idea of living within close proximity to nature has enticed people for centuries, especially for the ones used to living in bustling cities. Just picturing a cozy resort in the countryside, or playing music that resembles the feelings of holiday-making can drive us to go on a well-deserved vacation. Even when we don’t know where to, or whether we have the time or resources to slip out of our busy days, or even if that destination exists only in our imaginations. But when we do entertain ourselves with such ideas, we feel like we have taken a step to heal ourselves or to give our mind a worthy time out.\n\nOn the other hand, we have been living in human-focused settlements like cities for around 10,000 years, and we have all we need in an urban landscape, yet the idea of living in a secluded resort close to nature kept inviting us. This begs the question: were we supposed to live adjacent to nature to live well? Is it in our nature that we are wired to go back to the world beyond our doors? Or was it because we are aware of how big nature is, and how little time and resources we have to explore them all?\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Dec22",

            "description": "The idea of living within close proximity to nature has enticed people for centuries, especially for the ones used to living in bustling cities. Just picturing a cozy resort in the countryside, or playing music that resembles the feelings of holiday-making can drive us to go on a well-deserved vacation. Even when we don’t know where to, or whether we have the time or resources to slip out of our busy days, or even if that destination exists only in our imaginations. But when we do entertain ourselves with such ideas, we feel like we have taken a step to heal ourselves or to give our mind a worthy time out.\n\nOn the other hand, we have been living in human-focused settlements like cities for around 10,000 years, and we have all we need in an urban landscape, yet the idea of living in a secluded resort close to nature kept inviting us. This begs the question: were we supposed to live adjacent to nature to live well? Is it in our nature that we are wired to go back to the world beyond our doors? Or was it because we are aware of how big nature is, and how little time and resources we have to explore them all?\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Dec22",

            "description": "This generator is named 'Ichigo' (苺/ いちご), the Japanese word for 'strawberry'. \n\nSeeing each iteration from a suitable distance, small dots (to me, reminiscent of strawberry seeds) overlay different sequences of geometric repetitions, implying a sense of texture, grittiness and irregularity. \n\nBy looking closer however, it becomes apparent to the viewer that the majority of the composition is in fact government by orderly elements, in this case grids of dots. \n\nThis discovery invites the viewer to consider the output in front of them at different levels, near and far. At what point do you feel the dots begin to dissolve into a texture? When do you stop noticing the dots and instead begin to perceive the overall composition?\n\nThese questions are posed in a similar fashion as with meditation; at what point does something become something else? When does an in-breath become an out-breath and vice versa? \n\nContemplation on simple questions like these can open a small portal into stillness and mindfulness by taking time to slowly observe our responses. \n\n23 palettes are included, each named after different areas of Tokyo. \n\nPress 'S' to download a full size 6000px x 6000px PNG output. \n\nAs always, much gratitude and enjoy your piece.
