            "description": "A mix of aesthetics from the Ukiyo-e and Shin-hanga woodblock movements, with modern elements.  \n\nukiyo-e (浮世絵) = \"pictures of the floating world\", which peaked in the late 19th century. \nshin-hanga (新版画) = \"new prints\", from roughly the 1920-1950s. \n\nSome comparisons between the prints of the Japanese masters and gen-art: \n\n* The number of prints. Based on how well a piece was received, the publisher could decide to produce more copies, usually in batches of 200. Compare this to limiting the edition size on fx(hash). The initial prints would have sharp lines and accurately coloured areas. Very popular prints with thousands of impressions would slowly degrade the blocks, leaving final prints with worn-out linework and colours that weren't true to originals.  \n\n* Woodblock prints were actually a collab between the artist, the wood carver, and the printer. In many cases only the artist and publisher were recognized on the final prints. It was usually the publisher who owned the woodblock, not the artist. Often the artist was considered a worker, contracted at the request of the publisher or patrons funding the project. Compare this to the NFT space, where ownership is carved onto the blockchain, and artists have freedom to create whatever they wish. \n\n* Copyminters.... Similar to the NFT world, fake publishers sprang up from time to time, who would reproduce famous prints. Enji Takamizawa was one such counterfeiter, who was able to skilfully produce woodblocks replicating originals down to the wood grain! \n\n* While fine-quality woodblock prints from the Edo era command huge auction prices today, they were in reality affordable art for the regular people of their time. NFTs are similar in this light, where we can enjoy pieces at home rather than say, visiting galleries or museums of unattainable art. \n\n\n\nAdditional querystring params (use when viewing in a separate window) \n\n* fullsize=true (33 megapixel output) \n* colourcorrect=false \n* grain=false \n* border=false \n\n\n\nLicenses included in source. Relying on: \n\n* PIXIJS for drawing \n* JSTS for geometry functions \n* chromajs for colour functions \n* noise and gaussian helpers from p5js ",

Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

These are re-chosen on randomisation so may change the feel of the artwork significantly.",

            "description": "A mix of aesthetics from the Ukiyo-e and Shin-hanga woodblock movements, with modern elements.  \n\nukiyo-e (浮世絵) = \"pictures of the floating world\", which peaked in the late 19th century. \nshin-hanga (新版画) = \"new prints\", from roughly the 1920-1950s. \n\nSome comparisons between the prints of the Japanese masters and gen-art: \n\n* The number of prints. Based on how well a piece was received, the publisher could decide to produce more copies, usually in batches of 200. Compare this to limiting the edition size on fx(hash). The initial prints would have sharp lines and accurately coloured areas. Very popular prints with thousands of impressions would slowly degrade the blocks, leaving final prints with worn-out linework and colours that weren't true to originals.  \n\n* Woodblock prints were actually a collab between the artist, the wood carver, and the printer. In many cases only the artist and publisher were recognized on the final prints. It was usually the publisher who owned the woodblock, not the artist. Often the artist was considered a worker, contracted at the request of the publisher or patrons funding the project. Compare this to the NFT space, where ownership is carved onto the blockchain, and artists have freedom to create whatever they wish. \n\n* Copyminters.... Similar to the NFT world, fake publishers sprang up from time to time, who would reproduce famous prints. Enji Takamizawa was one such counterfeiter, who was able to skilfully produce woodblocks replicating originals down to the wood grain! \n\n* While fine-quality woodblock prints from the Edo era command huge auction prices today, they were in reality affordable art for the regular people of their time. NFTs are similar in this light, where we can enjoy pieces at home rather than say, visiting galleries or museums of unattainable art. \n\n\n\nAdditional querystring params (use when viewing in a separate window) \n\n* fullsize=true (33 megapixel output) \n* colourcorrect=false \n* grain=false \n* border=false \n\n\n\nLicenses included in source. Relying on: \n\n* PIXIJS for drawing \n* JSTS for geometry functions \n* chromajs for colour functions \n* noise and gaussian helpers from p5js ",

Mint or collect “fx(haish) - the Generator”\nStep 2. Visit https://www.arqtistic.com/fx(haish) to generate your “fx(haish) - The AI City” based on your mint. You have 20 tries.\nStep 3. Await further instructions.\n\n\n// FURTHER INFO\n\nThis algorithm has been designed to produce images which are suitable for the subsequent AI generation. The token consists of a random number of randomly placed and sized rectangles, filled with a noise gradient pattern. In short, Diffusion AI Models thrive on noise.\n\nThe AI generation uses Stable Diffusion 1.5 through an API designed by the 330ai team (@Pixelmindai). The WebUI has been developed by Nik0gda (@AntonCebanu2). AI Prompt has been designed (by me) to produce images of Cities, but you can possibly make it do other things, if you try hard enough.",

It's a search for creating harmonies and disharmonies by combining 3 colors with 3 unsynchronized mathematical equations. Udnē explores the beauty within triadic compositions while attempting to integrate two contrasting textures by forming instances of non-figurative scenes. The collection is a reflection of integrated and contrasting textures in micro and macro scale that we see in our everyday life environment.\n\nYou can press 's' in liveMode to save as 1000x1000px .png.\n\nIn liveMode, add '&density=7’ to the end of the URL to render at high resolution (7000x7000px). You can use 5, 7 or 10 for different resolutions. It will automatically download when the rendering is finished. \n\nSome compositions might take longer to render in low-performance computers. Please be patient and enjoy the process!\n\nAs a rare probability there is an intentionally kept glitch.\n\nMade with p5js.\n@distcollective, November 2022\n",

            "description": "A mix of aesthetics from the Ukiyo-e and Shin-hanga woodblock movements, with modern elements.  \n\nukiyo-e (浮世絵) = \"pictures of the floating world\", which peaked in the late 19th century. \nshin-hanga (新版画) = \"new prints\", from roughly the 1920-1950s. \n\nSome comparisons between the prints of the Japanese masters and gen-art: \n\n* The number of prints. Based on how well a piece was received, the publisher could decide to produce more copies, usually in batches of 200. Compare this to limiting the edition size on fx(hash). The initial prints would have sharp lines and accurately coloured areas. Very popular prints with thousands of impressions would slowly degrade the blocks, leaving final prints with worn-out linework and colours that weren't true to originals.  \n\n* Woodblock prints were actually a collab between the artist, the wood carver, and the printer. In many cases only the artist and publisher were recognized on the final prints. It was usually the publisher who owned the woodblock, not the artist. Often the artist was considered a worker, contracted at the request of the publisher or patrons funding the project. Compare this to the NFT space, where ownership is carved onto the blockchain, and artists have freedom to create whatever they wish. \n\n* Copyminters.... Similar to the NFT world, fake publishers sprang up from time to time, who would reproduce famous prints. Enji Takamizawa was one such counterfeiter, who was able to skilfully produce woodblocks replicating originals down to the wood grain! \n\n* While fine-quality woodblock prints from the Edo era command huge auction prices today, they were in reality affordable art for the regular people of their time. NFTs are similar in this light, where we can enjoy pieces at home rather than say, visiting galleries or museums of unattainable art. \n\n\n\nAdditional querystring params (use when viewing in a separate window) \n\n* fullsize=true (33 megapixel output) \n* colourcorrect=false \n* grain=false \n* border=false \n\n\n\nLicenses included in source. Relying on: \n\n* PIXIJS for drawing \n* JSTS for geometry functions \n* chromajs for colour functions \n* noise and gaussian helpers from p5js ",
