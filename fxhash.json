Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file.

This generative art project was inspired by the appreciation of collected memories, windows in time to our past experiences and loved ones. Using basic geometry such as rectangles, squares, circles, ellipses, triangles with random compositions and many possible color palettes, Finestre presents our impression of portals to the Universes of collected memories through abstract still code-based outputs.\n\nFinestre is a collaboration generative art project between generative artists Gonz0x and Schizzo.\n\nFinestre has some fun interactive features which allows collectors to view the work in different configurations. For example, collectors can isolate the deconstructed background layers, isolate the main constructed layer, add Grain and also enter a Free Play mode which allows for the option to draw background and foreground layers, stacking infinitely. You can Save off a render as a .png.\n\nPress \"C\" for Constructed Mode (Isolate Foreground)\nPress \"D\" for Deconstructed Mode (Isolate Background)\nPress \"R\" to reset to Default = C & D\nPress \"G\" to add grain texture with each press\nPress \"S\" saves render\n \nPress \"F\" to toggle Free Play mode\nIn Free Play, Press \"Q\" repeatedly to add Deconstructed layers\nIn Free Play, Press \"W\" repeatedly to add Constructed layers",
