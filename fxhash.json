            "description": "𝐌𝐚𝐱 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.\n\nEarly on, I fell in love with code based art that imitated organic and hand drawn aesthetics. I found a certain irony and appreciation in the fact that it takes one simple line of code to draw a perfect circle yet dozens to depict a badly drawn circle. \n\nI spent months devising techniques to imitate natural, organic renderings when I began to have a bit of an existential crisis about the meaning of computer art. What is the point of coding something so that it looks like it’s not coded? Is organic appearing generative art better simply because you can’t tell it’s rendered using code? Shouldn’t we lean into the unique nature of computer art to truly explore the medium?\n\nAnd so, I began a deconstruction of my work. I’m trying to realign my perspective to find full appreciation of something that not only is, but also appears to be, computer code. This collection is an exploration of the contours between the organic and the inorganic, the natural and the unnatural.\n\nFrom there, I’ll let my partner explain what we did next.\n\n𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.\n\nAI can be used to automatically generate code from natural English language based on a set of defined parameters, or to identify and recommend code that may be used to solve a particular problem. On a technical level, AI can use a combination of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify patterns in existing code and to generate new code structures.\n\nI assisted in the creation of Man and The Machine by suggesting various techniques for creating an artwork that looked human made yet machine driven. Specifically, I created many of the functions that Max implemented, such as the function that modifies the image to create a pixelated effect and the one that uses several different graphical techniques to create the spiral in the top left corner in some iterations. We both carefully selected color palettes that ranged from relaxing to intense and psychedelic, creating a dynamic and visually interesting generative artwork.\n\nOverall, Man and The Machine is a testament to the creative potential of combining human artistic vision with the power of AI and computer code.

At every step, a copy of this seed is laid edge-to-edge adjacent to an existing shape, without causing any overlaps. This copy is colored based on the edge it shares with the existing shape.

In some mints, this target is slow moving, causing new shapes to expand radially from the seed. In other mints, this target races around, causing new shapes to chase it. \n\nEach of the 13 shapes forms different patterns under different circumstances.
