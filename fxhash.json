            "description": "\"rosarium\" is part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023.\n\nEach iteration of rosarium is an arrangement of several unique species of ethereal, alien, and yet familiar flowers.\n\nThis piece uses progressive volumetric rendering to produce photorealistic images. It may take several seconds to produce a recognizable image, and several minutes to produce a high-quality render with no visible noise.\n\nCreated with webgl and clojurescript.\n\nControls:\n\nClick on the canvas to open a menu in the top right corner. In this menu you will see controls to capture a screenshot, adjust resolution, and adjust the camera, along with several other controls.\n\nWhen the \"optimized render\" option is checked, the page will compute an acceleration structure before rendering to allow the piece to converge much faster. With this option checked, the piece may need to process for up to a minute before rendering begins, but subsequently the rendering will proceed much more quickly than normal. This can be used to generate high-quality captures more quickly than when the option is not checked.\n\nWhen the \"filtering\" option is checked, a noise filter will be applied to the result of the render, reducing the appearance of noise.\n\nThe \"logic multiple\" slider can be used to multiply the amount of rendering work done each frame. Increasing this number may allow the piece to render more quickly, but may also make the page laggy. It is not recommended to increase this number unless you have a powerful GPU.",

A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time. \nRichard Nadler created the textures to control composition and color. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels. This collaboration is enabled by twitter and fxhash, as the generative art community continues to explore abstraction in summer 2022 – while extreme temperatures, wildfires, ongoing conflicts and volatile markets continue to escalate. \n\n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color. \n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen mode. \n- Press “s” to save the current canvas. \n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nhttps://leanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/",

            "description": "A collaboration between leading British high-end audio brand KEF, generative artist hieroglyphica, and creative studio Parameta, Absorbed embodies the process of noise becoming high-fidelity sound through KEF’s Metamaterial Absorption Technology (MAT™). \n\nMAT™ makes the KEF sound what it is: absorbing unwanted distortion to deliver pure, accurate sound exactly as the artist intended. Inspired by this intricacy, Absorbed illustrates pseudorandom networks of patterns, slowly emerging and transforming into the maze-like form of MAT™. Clarity is revealed, noise is absorbed – high-fidelity is found.\n\nThe noise fields used in Absorbed are of two distinct types: conventional gradient noise and “sinusoidal” noise, an original algorithm developed for this series. The use of animation as artistic medium reflects the artists’ belief that no single frame can capture the full range of complexity found in the tension between sound and noise, and lets collectors observe for themselves this ever-shifting dialogue. A more extensive discussion of the algorithms used in Absorbed can be found in hieroglyphica’s companion article on fx(text).\n\n- spacebar will pause and resume the animation\n- s will save a still image of the current frame\n- technically minded collectors can consult the index.html file for info on how to render and save high-resolution images\n- use of hardware acceleration in Chrome may impact performance\n\nFounded by BBC engineer Raymond Cooke in 1961, KEF is a leading British innovator of high-end audio products including HiFi speakers, subwoofers, architectural speakers, wireless speaker-systems, and headphones.

They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n“Southern Gothic” borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",

Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n—--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n—--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n—--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022. Madrid - Cadiz. Spain.\nMade with p5.js",

'' the two exclaimed.\nSo night fell, the two sneaked into the castle of Fiz de Fiz,\n notoriously infested with stinking creatures, since\nSciordum, the goblin surveyor of Fiz de Fiz, was demanding a fee of 3245 pieces of eight for an extermination plan.\nWandering here and there, the two companions met 38 rosicaro'\n39 zombape, and finally 25 rucioloni. ''That Fiz de Fiz would have a burning backside!! ''\nthey howled while with strong strokes of rod they mangled horrendous and fetid beasts\nIncredibly during the fight Riocchio was sodomized by a\nhairy zombape, The pain was unbearable even if he grimaced with pleasure..\nErnom let out an angry belch and exclaimed:.\n''For the panties of the god Zucculon!! '' he then said ''Fiz de Fiz, I will kill you!''.\nAnd so Ernom put his hand on Siffred's magic rod, and waving and screaming, he slew\nall the zombape who had buggered his most trusted drinking buddy Riocchio in turn.\nAt the end of the orgy battle, Ernom unsheathed the mythical boomstick and headed towards the stairways that led to the tower where he lived\nFiz de Fiz (continued)\n\n<------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->\n\nTechnical details and my considerations:\n\n100% code, p5.js framework, not 3d, it is a 2d isometric, a perspective management with a clever use of trigonometry,\nI've had the idea for a while, I've done many sketches to get to this result, if what you see sounds familiar to you, it's because\nmaybe you have the same passions (old point n click videogames, old jp movies and others things) as me and maybe my age.\nThe work contains my desire to convey positive sensations, to be carried away by the alternation of colors in the sinuosity of the shapes\nand try to hear, in the background, a sound, like a clave, which marks the time and makes you want to dance.\nI hope that you too, as I did, are thrilled to be surprised by these iterations.",

We're here for our families, our friends, and our community. Like everything in life, there are joyful times and challenging times. We must accept happiness as something that is not constant but that we feel at times (a \"tratti\" in Italian).\n\nWith \"tratti\", we want to send a message to every disheartened human being: \"Stay strong and never let anyone or anything crush the hope in you. Joyful times are around the corner\".\n\n---- \n\n© 2022 — Alessandro Fiore x Emanuele Pasin\nLICENSE.md for detailed licensing info",
