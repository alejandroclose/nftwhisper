            "description": "Sol is a companion project that complements my recent series, Metamorphosis. Both projects share a common foundation - a cellular automata engine. The state of each cell in a new generation is influenced by its own state as well as those of its neighboring cells from the last generation. The rules guiding these state transitions, however, are dynamic.\n\nSol for me is an experimental plotter project. As a gesture of my gratitude to minters of Metamorphosis, all minters will be on the reserve list for a free piece of Sol. I’ll take a snapshot of Metamorphosis for the reserve list 30 minutes prior to Sol’s launch. For three days (unless all reserve-holders mint sooner), Sol will be only for those on the reserve list and I'll add anyone who purchases Metamorphosis on primary subsequently. After this period, any remaining pieces, along with an additional 50 mints, will be available for public sale.\n\nA Note on the Name: The inspiration behind the name 'Sol' springs from my visits to SF MoMA, where I always find myself in the space dedicated to Sol LeWitt. Through the repetition and variation of a singular concept, LeWitt constructed forms that were striking, often evolving from basic geometric forms into intricate structures. The same is also echoed in the principle of emergence in cellular automata, where complex systems arise from the interactions of simple components governed by rules. This series, Sol, is a homage to LeWitt's ingenuity in favoring dispassionate geometric forms over the emotionally-infused abstract art styles.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete svg file for plotting. To download three separate svg files with individual colors for plotting press 1,2 & 3. Running an optimization tool can help decrease the plotting time.\n\nPixel Love!\n",

In this work I’ve tried to give it a new twist, combining it with different methods to place points in space, and filling each triangle with lines that go from one corner to the opposite side. The goal is to generate a wide range of semi-abstract scenes, that can sometimes be reminiscent of the work of Paul Klee, Lyonel Feininger or other Bauhaus members.\n\nControls:\n[c] to switch between 3 color modes: color mixes, color zones and monochrome\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to save a screen capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at 2x, 3x, … your viewport size\n\nThis work will adapt nicely to any screen format.\nNo palettes have been used, it is all random colors within a certain hue and saturation range.\nMade with p5.js and d3.js\n",

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke.\n100% of the proceeds from primary sales are donated to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke. \nhttps://www.tribute-hwf.com/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUndisputably, my mathematical background makes me naturally attracted to graphs, math functions, and transformations. I use math in ways that mathematicians could consider nonsense, but which produce fascinating aesthetic elements for creation (to paraphrase Herbert W. Franke). Combining scientific symbols and illustrations with fictional data produces pseudo-persuasive generative imagery that we can easily take to be absolute truth or in which we find meaningful patterns.\nIn the special issue of Leonardo, Visual Mathematics from 1992, Herbert W. Franke and Horst S. Helbig published the article Generative Mathematics: Mathematically Described and Calculated Visual Art.\n\nThey propose that “Through the use of [mathematical] formulas (software) we gain generative principles. Beyond formal descriptions, we obtain guides for the construction of images. For example, if we use a parametric representation of a curve, the result is similar to traditional methods of drawing and painting […]“ Additionally, mathematics removes frame limits and adds the possibilities for transitions, transformations, movement, and interaction by implementing simple changes to the defining parameters.\n\nI’m also very fond of the analysis and comparison (mentioned there) of digitally generated images and Constructivist design. Limitations of the technology (in the 70s) allowed only simple line drawings, based on fixed proportions same as Constructivists did. “In a short time, all possible features were exhausted, so it became an obvious goal to try to extend them. This was done first by the use of random generators — a highly interesting expansion of design principles […]” Another expansion happened by adding curved shapes, first simple then complex that overcame possibilities of drawing with compasses and rulers. “[…] oscillating curves are easily obtained through mathematical formulas and computer-graphic systems. The results we achieve on this basis do not look like Constructivist presentations, but their rationality and precision derive from Constructivist principles. ”\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nEach mint contains both dark and light version, use D/N keys to switch between “day & night”.\n \nBase shapes are circles or Lissajous curves modified by the noise function. Shapes are arranged in a grid or by a circle packing algorithm. Lines are drawn smoothly or in stripes. Around 20% of the mints have lines in only one color (black/white). \n\nDepending on the browser/configuration rendering times will vary. \n",

For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

The code tries to replicate not only the style, but also the process and inaccuracies that go into a drawing.\n\nEach iteration has a unique title. \nAll 256 rendered outputs and their respective titles will be displayed in high quality on https://twistie.org/lineage. \n\n10 lucky owners will have their iteration hand drawn and signed. They will each receive the physical 1/1 as well as an NFT version.\n\nPress 's' on keyboard to save in high-res. This is how the art is intended to be viewed.\n\nHardware acceleration on Chromium-based browsers can impact performance!",

The end result being anything from an impossible to imagine stairway, a scene in space that makes the viewer feel a bit reflective, a complex texture of gradient colors or simply a peaceful and interesting pattern.\n\nI always like to try and take advantage of the animation that digital art provides, even if the final result is a static piece of art, which was the philosophy here, though, the visual effect of the animation in this project really just serves to augment the final image, even if it is quite interesting. \n\nIt is tempting to do more with this project and build the \"planets\" out with more structures,\nbut sometimes simple is better, and knowing when to stop is key. These exist fairly well as\n\"nice to look at\" without going overboard.\n\nThe initial render can take more than a few seconds, but it runs at 60 fps after render without problem.\n\nThis will always display at a 2:1 aspect ratio and should size up and down well for all sizes.\n\nTo get a specific size (xxxx), simply add ?size=xxxx onto the end of the URL.\n\n[LEFT_ARROW/RIGHT_ARROW] - to speed up/slow down the animation\n\n[r] - redraw the image",
