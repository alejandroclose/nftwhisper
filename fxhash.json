            "description": "ARTIST:  Geneva Lee Robles\n\nMEDIUM: This work is an image composition with generative elements. The underlying image is a handmade linocut print whose parts were deconstructed via powerpoint, and pixel arrays processed via p5js. In this debut collection, the artist utilizes traditional and digital mediums to convey the feeling of simplicity and chaos.           \n\nTHE ART: “The Weight” is an award winner for the New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) NFT Award Program.  Inspired by bridging traditional art and technology, subsequent iterations of the work utilize coded generative elements to enhance its story.  \n\nEXHIBITION: “THE WEIGHT” is a part of “Demystifying NFTs: The Award Exhibition”, on display in Voxel’s Metaverse at the BRIDGE ++ space from December 15th - December 31st, 2022, curated by Laura Ó Reilly and presented by NYFA. \n\nBEHIND THE ART: Weight is a recurring theme in the artist’s work, depicted metaphorically as she revisits the emotional turbulence she experienced as a child of Chinese and Puerto Rican descent, raised in a home of heroin addiction and chaos. The weight tells the story of the heaviness we carry in life, and our resilience to keep going in spite of its persistence.  \n\nABOUT THE ARTIST:  Geneva Lee Robles is an interdisciplinary artist, living in New York City.  She was born in the Bronx and raised in Brooklyn, NY, during a tumultuous period in the 1980s.  Her work attempts to capture the emotional turbulence one is feeling, when no one is watching. She explores themes of loneliness within one's self and their relationships.  She is inspired by integrating traditional forms of art and pushing the envelope of what's possible through technology. \n\nCOLLECTORS RIGHTS: Includes the permission to digitally exhibit in galleries, museums and the collector’s home.

This creates a constantly shifting harmonic landscape that is both familiar and unpredictable.\n\nThe rhythmic element of the composition is based on the layering of multiple polyrhythms, creating a complex and ever-shifting pulse. The polyrhythms are often based on a central pulse that is then layered and interleaved with other polyrhythms to create a complex and dynamic rhythmical landscape.\n\nOverall, the pieces are designed to explore the relationships between shapes, harmonies, and rhythms in a way that is both logical and unexpected. The goal is to create a composition that is both cohesive and unpredictable, allowing for an ever-evolving soundscape of sound and movement.\n\npress s to save png \n\n99.9% of primary proceeds to charity \n94.9% of secondary royalties to charity and 5% to Ty Vek for the inspiration \n ",

            "description": "Bardez is the Armenian word for garden. It is etymologically tied to an ancient word for paradise, but that link goes deeper than etymology. Gardens have always been small pieces of paradise for me, and hearing the word in Armenian triggers a flood of warm memories.\n\nMemories of wandering around my grandfather’s garden, plucking ripe plums and figs from their branches.\nMemories of playing in my parents yard, the scent of jasmine in the summer heat.\nOf sun warmed tomatoes in my mom’s vegetable patch.\nThe smell of dirt and grass.\nMud on my hands.\nSun on my skin.\nMemories of paradise.\n\nI hope you enjoy these gardens I’ve planted, and I hope they remind you of some warm and wonderful memories.\n \nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n - This piece uses a shader to compute the lighting of the terrain in the first frame. If you don’t have a graphics card, you may have difficulty running this.\n\n - Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you the progress of the render, and also show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.\n\n - Finally, collectors at the highest tier will be entitled to a signed print of their edition.

            "description": "1) INTRO (MUST READ)\n\"Emotions\" is a unique Animated, watercolor or liquid painting-like abstract generative artwork which incorporates some \"innovative\" or unique techniques and approaches.\n\nIf find the above too selfish or wonder if its worth to buy this sh**t in a relative high price from an unknown \"artist\" please give some time to read the whole description. You will not regret!\n\nI don't like to talk about myself or using marketing expressions, however sometimes have to, in order to clarify some points & spot some important features\n\nAll started as an exercise to shaders on Nov. 2022 and is the completion of this experimentation (rotating colors): twitter.com/Uniray_net/status/1587588272842280961 \n\n\n2) SHORT BIO\nI was always between graphics & programming. Was very good in both areas (as my teachers were saying) & remember me also drawing from childhood \nThe first years i was focusing more in graphics (i was teaching graphics as well) and i was programming graphics for hobby\n\nFrom 2005 & later i started a turn in my career & made programming my profession for the last 13-14 years (developer in some private companies)\nIn 2020 I started again a more serious involvement with graphics without knowing anything about NFTs or WEB3. And from 2021 i started getting more & more involved. Still so many to learn\n\nI am new in gen art, started few months ago with plain javascript.\nStarted learning p5js in Aug. 2002 and shaders in Oct. 2022 & \"Emotions\" is my first \"large\" work. \nAlready published some simpler & old works (eg. 3D) & things i developed as i was learning\n\n3) FEATURES\nI think i am presenting something relatively different with \"Emotions\" & always try to apply one of my favorite motto: \"Lead, don't follow\"\n\nThe general experience in programming & the fact that i had already programmed graphics in conjunction with my love for experimentation & searching behind the things, helped me to incorporate in \"Emotions\" some \"innovative\" i believe features & techniques (it sounds selfish but let me explain)\n\n- First i am \"proud\" of the shader work. I developed completely custom \"advanced\" techniques that discovered after experimentation & some knowledge of course.\n\n- \"Emotions\" includes 51 palettes (with several color each) that have been stored externally (in the application folder) as Adobe \".act\" color table files so that avoiding hard coded (including all palettes in the code) consuming in this way resources eg. memory from user's system. I just load only the one palette i am going to use\n\n- A fast svg Convolution kernel Matrix filter along with a displacement filter used for the texture\n\n- Lastly & minor, you can switch Orientation (Portrait, Landscape, etc) & Resolution with the press of a key (no need to manually add params in the url)\n\nFrom the above the most important part is the webGL shader.\n\n4) CONCLUSION\n\"Emotions\" is an animated watercolor painting-like (or liquid pigments material) abstract \"live\" work, that instead of staying static, starting with an initial state & slowly flowing, changing shapes & colors as sometimes happens with our emotions & feelings which may changed over time. \nColors also represents emotions eg. red is for passion, green is the color of hope, etc \n\nGive some time to observe the progress and liquid feel and motion in shapes and colors.  Relax and look the flow and color diffusion - spread  & the whole \"painting\" to transformed slowly. \n\nKEYS:\n- 1-4: Set resolution from 1x to 4x of the current dimension (slower performance in higher values)\n- T: Texture on/off\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait (default). Aspect ratio 0.75\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape with ratio 4/3\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ between orientations\n\n- Spacebar: animation on/off\n\nMOUSE:\n- Click: animation on/off\n- Move: left - right on canvas (when in animation) to interact\n\n----\nMade with p5js & custom shaders. Pure code. No Images used\n\n© Dec. 2022  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

The underlying image is a handmade linocut print whose parts were deconstructed via powerpoint, and pixel arrays processed via p5js. In this debut collection, the artist utilizes traditional and digital mediums to convey the feeling of simplicity and chaos.           \n\nTHE ART: “The Weight” is an award winner for the New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) NFT Award Program.  Inspired by bridging traditional art and technology, subsequent iterations of the work utilize coded generative elements to enhance its story.  \n\nEXHIBITION: “THE WEIGHT” is a part of “Demystifying NFTs: The Award Exhibition”, on display in Voxel’s Metaverse at the BRIDGE ++ space from December 15th - December 31st, 2022, curated by Laura Ó Reilly and presented by NYFA. \n\nBEHIND THE ART: Weight is a recurring theme in the artist’s work, depicted metaphorically as she revisits the emotional turbulence she experienced as a child of Chinese and Puerto Rican descent, raised in a home of heroin addiction and chaos. The weight tells the story of the heaviness we carry in life, and our resilience to keep going in spite of its persistence.  \n\nABOUT THE ARTIST:  Geneva Lee Robles is an interdisciplinary artist, living in New York City.  She was born in the Bronx and raised in Brooklyn, NY, during a tumultuous period in the 1980s.  Her work attempts to capture the emotional turbulence one is feeling, when no one is watching. She explores themes of loneliness within one's self and their relationships.

The artwork is derived from an initial sketch of Bwople which, despite being not the one that was chosen, still managed to captivate interests. The project provides a unique glimpse into an alternate universe in which Bwople could have been represented.\n\nAll images are hand-drawn work by Gengoya and composed by Vector Recite using PureSpider's fxhash-pfp maker tool.\n\nTo download the full size image on fx(hash):\n- Click \"open\" below the image\n- Left click on the image, a \"Download image\" button will appear on the bottom right.\n- Click the \"Download image\" button.",
