            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

            "description": "🔥 BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY \"open edition\" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",

            "description": "Welcome to the ultimate pico_punk generator! This interactive token is a parameter based generator that creates unique pico_punk generators. Each one will generate one pico_punk with a number of layers chosen by you during the parameter selection phase. Additionally, you can use the buttons to navigate the generative space, and create your own pico_punks via an interactive process of discovery. This is the final pico_punk generator I intend to make, with the extra capabilities added by the parameter selection process, and the final tweaks and changes I made to the appearances and effects, I think this project is now as complete as I can ever make it.\n\nThe controls:\n- arrow keys: move through the generative space... each step adds one layer to the composition\n- x button: take a screenshot of the generated pico_punk\n- o button: clear all layers except the current one (clean slate for building a new pico_punk)\n\nEach layer has a chance to apply one of various visual effects, which vary in how transformative (or disruptive) they are.\n\n\npico_punks began as a project to create something akin to DOS Punks, but fully generative, without any manual intervention or pre-rendered components, using only the Pico-8 Fantasy Console. You can find the first generator here: (https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/439049). In this early version, the generator was interactive, but each pico_punk was totally isolated, being generated from one unique seed and one consistent process. Over time, this evolved to this final experience: one in which the \"curator\", the user exploring the generator, is not just choosing from an infinite number of punks, but actually the process of exploration itself is modifying the output before your eyes.\n\npico_punks is all about exploring themes of irreversibility, noise, pattern recognition, pareidolia, and of course identity. What began for me as something bordering on satire, has become an integral part of how I represent myself online. It is my sincere wish that with these tools you are also able to create something unique that you feel represents you, and is something that couldn't have been made without you.\n\nThank you so much for these last couple years of support, and here's to many more making and collecting art together :)\n\n\nNotes on minting: \n- 30% of royalties go to the minter\n- 10% of royalties go to previous curated pico_punk holders\n- One reserve spot is generated for each curated pico_punk held, and they stack\n- One extra reserve spot is for my Mom",

            "description": "🔥 BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY \"open edition\" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",

            "description": "This artwork was released for Here & Now 5th Edition: THE PASSAGE (https://hereandnow.events) an interactive experience powered by @fx_hash and where, as in life, your actions shape the outcome of the artwork you receive. The base concept of this edition is \"The Pitch Drop\": the longest experiment in history\n\nThe experiment demonstrates the viscosity of a liquid that looks solid, the pitch, which viscosity is 230 billion times that of water. It started 96 years ago and is still running. In all that time only 9 drops have fallen and nobody has been able to see the drop falling\n\nIt made me think about how the molecules of a liquid behave as humans, connected to each other by soft forces but clearly separated, and how in the macro and in the micro when you look close enough you can see that where there was one truly there were many\n\nThe experiment show the importance we give to measure things and how time can give us information about what we are looking at. The continuous flux segmented in seconds and days. The constant advance vs the subjective perception. How long does a blink last?\n\nEvery iteration shows a black and white composition of floating spheres or formless blobs as an undetermined amount of matter. The image has the qualities from a old print with a digital degradation expressing the passing time and the passing times.\n\nControls:\n  \n  View:\n  'Mouse Drag' - View Rotation\n\n  The piece is rendered at the screen resolution. To render at different resolution add the following parameter to the url \"?res=size\" (being \"size\" the desired base width of the piece)\n\n  Export:\n  'm' - canvas save\n  1-9 - export with the pixels upscaled by the number. (To get \"big\" pixels)\n\n\nReleased on fx(hash) on March 20th, 2023\n(c) Victor Doval; all rights reserved",

The artwork and experience draw inspiration from the 'The Pitch Drop Experiment': the world's longest-running laboratory experiment. Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\nPitch is a group of materials that appear solid but are actually highly viscous liquids.\nThey shatter when struck, but also flow at an extremely slow rate.\n\nThese seemingly opposite properties raise questions about our perception of reality, as we experience space and movement on a determined timescale.\n\nInfluunt is a visual exploration of what could happen if space were to behave as pitch, flowing, bending, and shattering as we manipulate timescales and apply external forces by bending the rays of light.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://hereandnow.events/\n\nProcure a coin to participate in the event:\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/here-and-now:-edition-5\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current resolution\nPress 'H' to save the image at high resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nwwatkns\nMarch 2023",

            "description": "Welcome to the ultimate pico_punk generator! This interactive token is a parameter based generator that creates unique pico_punk generators. Each one will generate one pico_punk with a number of layers chosen by you during the parameter selection phase. Additionally, you can use the buttons to navigate the generative space, and create your own pico_punks via an interactive process of discovery. This is the final pico_punk generator I intend to make, with the extra capabilities added by the parameter selection process, and the final tweaks and changes I made to the appearances and effects, I think this project is now as complete as I can ever make it.\n\nThe controls:\n- arrow keys: move through the generative space... each step adds one layer to the composition\n- x button: take a screenshot of the generated pico_punk\n- o button: clear all layers except the current one (clean slate for building a new pico_punk)\n\nEach layer has a chance to apply one of various visual effects, which vary in how transformative (or disruptive) they are.\n\n\npico_punks began as a project to create something akin to DOS Punks, but fully generative, without any manual intervention or pre-rendered components, using only the Pico-8 Fantasy Console. You can find the first generator here: (https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/439049). In this early version, the generator was interactive, but each pico_punk was totally isolated, being generated from one unique seed and one consistent process. Over time, this evolved to this final experience: one in which the \"curator\", the user exploring the generator, is not just choosing from an infinite number of punks, but actually the process of exploration itself is modifying the output before your eyes.\n\npico_punks is all about exploring themes of irreversibility, noise, pattern recognition, pareidolia, and of course identity. What began for me as something bordering on satire, has become an integral part of how I represent myself online. It is my sincere wish that with these tools you are also able to create something unique that you feel represents you, and is something that couldn't have been made without you.\n\nThank you so much for these last couple years of support, and here's to many more making and collecting art together :)\n\n\nNotes on minting: \n- 30% of royalties go to the minter\n- 10% of royalties go to previous curated pico_punk holders\n- One reserve spot is generated for each curated pico_punk held, and they stack\n- One extra reserve spot is for my Mom",

            "description": "Welcome to the ultimate pico_punk generator! This interactive token is a parameter based generator that creates unique pico_punk generators. Each one will generate one pico_punk with a number of layers chosen by you during the parameter selection phase. Additionally, you can use the buttons to navigate the generative space, and create your own pico_punks via an interactive process of discovery. This is the final pico_punk generator I intend to make, with the extra capabilities added by the parameter selection process, and the final tweaks and changes I made to the appearances and effects, I think this project is now as complete as I can ever make it.\n\nThe controls:\n- arrow keys: move through the generative space... each step adds one layer to the composition\n- x button: take a screenshot of the generated pico_punk\n- o button: clear all layers except the current one (clean slate for building a new pico_punk)\n\nEach layer has a chance to apply one of various visual effects, which vary in how transformative (or disruptive) they are.\n\n\npico_punks began as a project to create something akin to DOS Punks, but fully generative, without any manual intervention or pre-rendered components, using only the Pico-8 Fantasy Console. You can find the first generator here: (https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/439049). In this early version, the generator was interactive, but each pico_punk was totally isolated, being generated from one unique seed and one consistent process. Over time, this evolved to this final experience: one in which the \"curator\", the user exploring the generator, is not just choosing from an infinite number of punks, but actually the process of exploration itself is modifying the output before your eyes.\n\npico_punks is all about exploring themes of irreversibility, noise, pattern recognition, pareidolia, and of course identity. What began for me as something bordering on satire, has become an integral part of how I represent myself online. It is my sincere wish that with these tools you are also able to create something unique that you feel represents you, and is something that couldn't have been made without you.\n\nThank you so much for these last couple years of support, and here's to many more making and collecting art together :)\n\n\nNotes on minting: \n- 30% of royalties go to the minter\n- 10% of royalties go to previous curated pico_punk holders\n- One reserve spot is generated for each curated pico_punk held, and they stack\n- One extra reserve spot is for my Mom",
