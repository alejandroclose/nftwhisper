            "description": "Step by Step explores the feeling of being stuck, confined - walking the path ahead of you often only seeing the immediate next step until exhaustion. We all feel this way from time to time — in our lives, jobs, bodies, situations — yet in our search for something, we shouldn't forget that there can still be beauty along the path.\n\nThe project takes some inspiration from Henri Matisse, both in the aesthetics of his later works (i.e. the \"Cut Outs\") and metaphorically in the sense that he had underwent medical treatment which left him wheelchair- or bed-bound towards the later part of his life, forcing him to give up painting, yet in his exploration of this new creative medium which involved cutting paper and pinning them up, his unorthodox work went on to become the most transformative of his career.\n\nReleased as part of the 4th edition of the Cure³ Parkinson's cure fundraiser exhibition organized by Artwise Curators and Bonhams as part of a specially comissioned selection of generative artists minting NFTs, curated by Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick with the support of fx(hash) at Bonhams, London from 13-17th January 2023.\n\n---\n33% of primary sales and 3% of secondary sales will be donated on-chain to Cure Parkinson’s\n---\n\nControls:\n• 'R' regenerates the piece (e.g. in case the window size changes)\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Jan 2023\nArtist: Yazid",

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. www.tribute-hwf.com\n\n\"Since the classical age of Greece, the golden ratio has been well known as the most balanced and therefore most aesthetically perfect proportion. In fact, it is supposedly often found in the fine arts and architecture and it is certainly important in geometry. But where is the proof that it is really the most beautiful proportion?\n\n\"The computer is proving to be a useful tool in exact art theory. Works of computer art are produced with the help of programs that describe the logic of the construction and its relevant measures. By varying the parameters you can vary the shapes of objects, and on the basis of the reaction of the public you can determine the best option. So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n\"A statistical evaluation would be interesting. Please email me with your results for the optimal proportion.\"\n\nI found it heartwarming that in 2011, Herbert W. Franke wrote the above, accompanied with a simple functional program on a Wolfram Demonstration page (https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/IsTheGoldenRatioReallyTheMostBeautifulProportion/) titled 'Is the Golden Ratio Really the Most Beautiful Proportion?' and invited people to submit their findings to him.\n\nThe main idea behind this project is ratios, a variety of them, used in a variety of ways, such as how a rectangle is repeatedly subdivided, or how it influences the aspect ratio of the piece, or how the colors in a palette are selected. These are represented in various styles, some of which are inspired by the aesthetic of Herbert W. Franke's diverse artworks, and his openness to experimentation with new technologies, such as plotter drawings, screens, screenprints, or 2D and 3D digital renderings.\n\nThis project, while not designed to be a formal statistical evaluation, is but my fun, colorful, and humble response to your inquiry, dear Herbert.\n\n---\n\n25% of primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke, with the goal of raising 20,000 Euros so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any money raised beyond this goal will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• Double-click/tap or 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n\nNote: Some mints require WEBGL and/or may take several seconds to fully render.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

            "description": "There’s beauty in simple things. Sunlight. A reflection on a puddle. The flight of a bird. Observing the clouds. Spending time with loved ones.\n\nTo celebrate the re-opening of fxhash, I'd like to contribute with some simple thing to enjoy among friends who rejoin after some time.\n\nSimple things is a piece that is just that: simple things. Nothing fancy here. Simple circles doing simple movement, with simple colours. Maybe the viewer will rejoice in observing them transit on the screen.\n\nIt has some controls: you can press “s” to save a png file. You can set a higher resolution pressing “d” followed by 1-9 to increase pixel density (if you get a black image, press “d 0” and start again with a lower number). Simple controls.\n\nIt has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n\nThe pieces exhibit simple variations: palettes, circle sizes, density of elements, backgrounds. The colours might be inverted sometimes. The direction of the movement changes also in some pieces. Some are grayscale pieces.\n\nJust like in life, enjoying simple things is sometimes enough to leave behind the noise and our worries. Also like in life, if one wants something extra, they may get it by looking for it...\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade in p5.js, and glsl for the image controls.",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

The focus will be on using these shapes and patterns to create dynamic and visually interesting compositions, both in 2D and 3D forms. The project begins by studying the use of grids and how they can be used to create structure and balance in a composition. Next, the use of cubes will be examined, and how they can be used to add depth and dimension to a composition. Finally, the project will delve into the use of patterns and how they can be used to create movement and interest within a composition.",

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

            "description": "Dopamine is a chemical released in the brain that makes you feel good.\n\nDopamine Dreams is an exploration of using patterns and geometric forms to create something that also makes you feel good; to create something that feels natural, as if it has sprung from the ground or appeared in the sky.  \n\nIn this work, there is a conversation happening between two modes for drawing the same grid. One is tight, geometric and calm. The other is loose, loopy and excited. They overlap, interlace and compete to fill the space.  One cannot exist without the other. Balance is the the key. Between them they create a landscape in which to dream. \n\nGenerative artwork by AutoEclectus\n\nControls in live mode:\n- After animation stops, press [s] to save a png\n\n@autoeclectus everywhere - Twitter, Instagram and Masterdon. \nhttps://autoeclectus.art",
