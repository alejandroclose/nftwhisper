            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac. In case the site crashes, close all other applications and retry. If you’re not able to render in 12K on your device, please get in touch (@pxlshrd on Social Media and Discord).\n\nPlease note:\n- The Adaptive mode has a slightly altered appearance compared to the default aspect ratio.\n\n- The code was tested on Mac Apple Silicon/Windows/iOS/iPadOS with consistent and pixel-perfect results throughout.\n\n- The live view on Android devices slightly deviates from those on the systems mentioned above.\n\n/////\n\nCreated with p5.js and GLSL shaders.",

If the piece is too dark, reduce the render length or increase the stroke weight. If the piece seems too light, alter the volatility of the noise, or slow it down with increased friction. Each parameter can, of course, be explained in great detail, but in reality the best way to work with the piece is to play.\n\nThe random numbers for the piece are generated using the minter's address, meaning that what you see as a live preview will be the exact mint received.",

            "description": "\".printing\" will become one of the redeemable gifts for \".printed\" holders.\n\nNow, let's explore the merits of expressing art in the digital realm versus the realm of printed art.\n\nOne significant point, in my opinion, is the difference in the colors achievable through CMYK and RGB. This also leads to variations in texture.\nIn \".printed\" I have opted for a format where colors are selected from a designated palette. This decision is influenced by the limitations of the CMYK color gamut for printing, but it's also driven by a conscious choice to use colors like yellow, white, and black shades that evoke a sense of glossiness and beauty when printed.\nIn this instance of \".printing\" the wide range from #000000 to #ffffff is available for selection, based on the display's color reproduction. The ability for the minter, rather than the artist, to freely choose and combine colors adds an intriguing aspect unique to the params system.\n\nAnother key distinction lies in capturing a fleeting moment of fondness versus capturing an ongoing movement within the framework of code. Unlike GIFs or video files, the necessity for this art to be expressed through code, specifically p5js, is emphasized by the temporal changes brought about by noise(). The patterns in this piece possess reproducibility through a seed, yet theoretically, they continue to transform infinitely.\n\nThis project stands as a significant milestone in my personal exploration of the regular variations in noise function.The pattern of this project is not perfectly symmetrical.\n\nIn \"printed\" there's the joy of selecting a moment inherent to physical objects, coupled with a glossy texture.\n\nIn \"printing\" the temporal evolution offered by p5js noise() function intertwines with a palette of 16,777,216 colors.\n\nI hope you find enjoyment in both aspects.\n\nGenerative art by @dotconatus\n\nBuilt in Javascript with p5.js.",

            "description": "Scapes is a long-form generative piece exploring an algorithm of a constrained range of limited color palettes and shapes. \n\nThe initial inspiration was a closeup photo that I took of a parking lot's black pavement with red and white stripes. The photo was taken during the winter when the lot was covered with ice and melting water creating an image of minimal geometry mixed with analog grain and texture. \n\nAs my exploration of the algorithm advanced, the inspiration grew to include styling influences of El Lissitzky's Prouns series. Similar to Prouns, the abstract shapes generated in Scapes conjure aerial views and urban architecture. Furthermore, El Lissitzky's Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge inspired a palette constrained to black, red, and white. The Constructive art of Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge additionally inspired the forms in Scapes to be primarily composed of geometric shapes.  \n\nScapes is a small collection reflecting the constrained nature of this piece. The scale might be small, but the output contains a lot of density that I enjoyed working into a limited palette. Enjoy!\n\nPress the S key to download a 1,800 x 1,800 pixel PNG.\n\nCreated By: lukaszgraphz\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/lukasz_x2\n\nArt: August 2023\nCreated with p5js\nCC BY-NC 4.0 ",

            "description": "Scapes is a long-form generative piece exploring an algorithm of a constrained range of limited color palettes and shapes. \n\nThe initial inspiration was a closeup photo that I took of a parking lot's black pavement with red and white stripes. The photo was taken during the winter when the lot was covered with ice and melting water creating an image of minimal geometry mixed with analog grain and texture. \n\nAs my exploration of the algorithm advanced, the inspiration grew to include styling influences of El Lissitzky's Prouns series. Similar to Prouns, the abstract shapes generated in Scapes conjure aerial views and urban architecture. Furthermore, El Lissitzky's Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge inspired a palette constrained to black, red, and white. The Constructive art of Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge additionally inspired the forms in Scapes to be primarily composed of geometric shapes.  \n\nScapes is a small collection reflecting the constrained nature of this piece. The scale might be small, but the output contains a lot of density that I enjoyed working into a limited palette.

            "description": "This work is based on an extension of the classical Voronoi partition algorithm. There is a set of nodes moving through the canvas, with colors assigned to them. Each pixel in the image computes its own color, as a weighted average of the n-closest nodes. \n\nCollectors are co-creators in this work. They can choose palette, the range of nodes considered for the color mix, and noise modifiers. They can also create nodes (up to 12) and set their position, velocity, and color, either freely or snapping them to a grid. This opens an unlimited space of possibilities for static or dynamic compositions. \n\nKeyboard controls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the animation\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n\nMade with p5.js and chroma.js\nPinball Geometry is part of the fxhackathon 2023: co-creation interfaces.\n",

            "description": "Bardez is the Armenian word for garden. It is etymologically tied to an ancient word for paradise, but that link goes deeper than etymology. Gardens have always been small pieces of paradise for me, and hearing the word in Armenian triggers a flood of warm memories.\n\nMemories of wandering around my grandfather’s garden, plucking ripe plums and figs from their branches.\nMemories of playing in my parents yard, the scent of jasmine in the summer heat.\nOf sun warmed tomatoes in my mom’s vegetable patch.\nThe smell of dirt and grass.\nMud on my hands.\nSun on my skin.\nMemories of paradise.\n\nI hope you enjoy these gardens I’ve planted, and I hope they remind you of some warm and wonderful memories.\n \nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n - This piece uses a shader to compute the lighting of the terrain in the first frame. If you don’t have a graphics card, you may have difficulty running this.\n\n - Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you the progress of the render, and also show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.\n\n - Finally, collectors at the highest tier will be entitled to a signed print of their edition. For further details and updates, keep an eye on my Twitter (@_NatSarkissian).\n",

            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac. In case the site crashes, close all other applications and retry. If you’re not able to render in 12K on your device, please get in touch (@pxlshrd on Social Media and Discord).\n\nPlease note:\n- The Adaptive mode has a slightly altered appearance compared to the default aspect ratio.\n\n- The code was tested on Mac Apple Silicon/Windows/iOS/iPadOS with consistent and pixel-perfect results throughout.\n\n- The live view on Android devices slightly deviates from those on the systems mentioned above.\n\n/////\n\nCreated with p5.js and GLSL shaders.",

            "description": "This project is my first one in a series of algorithmic studies. Inspired by the work of Casey Reas and his \"Process Compendium\", it starts with a very simple text description of an algorithmic process. In this case, I came up this description:\n\n\"Place N circles randomly on the canvas. Select a point on each of the circles, and rotate it around its circle. At each step, draw a random line that connects all the points\"\n\nEach step is drawn with very low opacity, and is repeated a large number of times (these pieces draw around 6 million lines). Eventually, complex structures, shapes and patterns appear, that were impossible to predict from the text description alone: this is an emergent system.\n\nThe text description voluntarily leaves things open to interpretation: how many points ? which colors to use ? which rules for the drawing opacity and line weight ? Do all points move at the same speed ? Can they accelerate ? Are the circles allowed to extend past the canvas boundaries ?\n\nThis makes the process capable of interesting variations, as well as reusable: another artist implementation of the same description would most likely give very different artworks.\n\nDespite the apparent simplicity of the description, this collection ended up being a real challenge. Drawing millions of lines with low opacity turned out to be impossible without a GPU. WebGL is required.\n\nThis token uses the regl.js library. The outputs are rendered at 2400x2400 and should be viewed at that size. You can generate high resolution outputs, up to 8000px, by adding &size=XXXX to the URL.",

            "description": "\".printing\" will become one of the redeemable gifts for \".printed\" holders.\n\nNow, let's explore the merits of expressing art in the digital realm versus the realm of printed art.\n\nOne significant point, in my opinion, is the difference in the colors achievable through CMYK and RGB. This also leads to variations in texture.\nIn \".printed\" I have opted for a format where colors are selected from a designated palette. This decision is influenced by the limitations of the CMYK color gamut for printing, but it's also driven by a conscious choice to use colors like yellow, white, and black shades that evoke a sense of glossiness and beauty when printed.\nIn this instance of \".printing\" the wide range from #000000 to #ffffff is available for selection, based on the display's color reproduction. The ability for the minter, rather than the artist, to freely choose and combine colors adds an intriguing aspect unique to the params system.\n\nAnother key distinction lies in capturing a fleeting moment of fondness versus capturing an ongoing movement within the framework of code. Unlike GIFs or video files, the necessity for this art to be expressed through code, specifically p5js, is emphasized by the temporal changes brought about by noise(). The patterns in this piece possess reproducibility through a seed, yet theoretically, they continue to transform infinitely.\n\nThis project stands as a significant milestone in my personal exploration of the regular variations in noise function.The pattern of this project is not perfectly symmetrical.\n\nIn \"printed\" there's the joy of selecting a moment inherent to physical objects, coupled with a glossy texture.\n\nIn \"printing\" the temporal evolution offered by p5js noise() function intertwines with a palette of 16,777,216 colors.\n\nI hope you find enjoyment in both aspects.\n\nGenerative art by @dotconatus\n\nBuilt in Javascript with p5.js.",

            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
