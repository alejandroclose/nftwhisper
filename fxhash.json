            "description": "A 4444 character magic spell for my rayhatching framework to render thinking rocks.\n\nThis piece may take some time to render (about 1-3 minutes, depending on hardware). The rendering time is symbolic of the vastness and agelessness of these rock structures, it is recommended to use the rendering time to contemplate deeply the concept of time spans so incredibly long, that to experience them they would have to overwrite your memories several times and thus are impossible to truly comprehend.\n\nTo ponder how, if they are so old, how come some of them float? Are these rocks the fixtures and has time and space itself eroded around them?\n\nThis project uses an approach called \"rejection sampling\". This means the program generates a random set of parameters, and then checks/previews how the resulting image would look. It measures the amount of visible objects, light and shadows, and then determines whether these fall into acceptable ranges. If not, it generates a new set of parameters. For certain hashes over a 100 parameter sets may be checked before it accepts the image.\n\nThe features of this project are \"cliff\", \"ground\", \"thing\" and \"sky\". These are not parameters, they are actual measurements of the resulting image, indicating what percentage of the view is occupied.\n\nThis piece can be saved as an SVG and plotted. It is recommended to run a path order optimization tool such as vpype or axicli, this will greatly reduce plotting time.\n\nSome options can be changed via the URL:\n\n&w=.25 : The line width in millimetres.\n&d=.4 : Line density (multiplier to linewidth).\n&h=235 : Page height in millimetres. The aspect ratio is 16:9, for a width of 420mm, suitable for A3 plotting.\n\nThe line width is set to 0.25 millimetres to suit most common fine liner pen stroke widths when plotting. \n\nIf you don't intend to plot this piece, perhaps also try rendering it at 0.2 or even 0.1 millimetres line width, for an even more detailed image (it will also take longer to render).\n\n(c) 2022 by Piter Pasma",

            "description": "AERO\n\nIn the stillness of the void, floating cities hang suspended, bound by no earthly gravity. The buildings, wrought in shades of dreamy pastels, appear as though they have been plucked from some other time and place, and set adrift in a new and unknowable realm.\n\nHere, amidst the stillness and silence, ropes hang loosely like vines, connecting the structures in a delicate web of possibility. The architecture of the buildings is vaguely familiar, yet strangely surreal, hinting at a past now forgotten.\n\nAs the eye wanders through this landscape of suspended structures, a feeling of nostalgia begins to seep in. There is a sense that these cities were once inhabited, bustling with the energy of human life. Now, they stand alone, abandoned and forgotten, as nature slowly reclaims its territory.\n\n\n\nThe AERO series explores how a minimalistic set of shapes and rules can be extrapolated to create complex assemblies, the same way individual buildings will form villages and cities.\n\nTo add a sense of organic texture to these geometric structures, ropes that connect certain squares have been added. They can sometimes take on the appearance of vines. This addition aims creates a sense of tension between the man-made and the natural.\n\n\n\nDouble click or double tap to save the current image\n\nIn fullscreen mode / live view:\nAdd \"&size=xxxx\" at the end of the url to generate a custom sized image\nAdd \"&clean\" at the end of the url to remove the grain effect\n\n\nArtist: Estienne\nFeb. 2023\nLicense: NFT 2.0",

The iterations will be titled ____ - Iteration 1, ____ - Iteration 2, etc. At this point, the number of iterations has not been determined, but more information will be provided as this experiment unfolds.\n\nThe final release will only be made available to those who have collected each iteration (using an allowlist), and will be released for free.\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

In some cases, code needed to be written manually to implement features like color schemes (hat tip to Bruce from Studio Yorktown), fxhash's preview and attributes, as well as some aesthetic changes that ChatGPT is unable to visualize and alter itself.

They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

            "description": "Ryoanji (龍安寺, The Temple of the Dragon at Peace) is a Zen temple located in Kyoto, Japan. The Ryoanji garden, considered the grail of kare-sansui (\"dry landscape\"), a type of Japanese Zen temple garden. Kare-sansui features distinctive larger rock formations arranged amidst a sweep of smooth pebbles raked into patterns that facilitate meditation.\n\nIf meditation is of the mind, then generation is a meditation of the machine. Generations of my coding asserted or not, of the gardens, ease mediations, in a sense of the infiniteness and impermanence of the generated. \n\nGiven the reality of physics, rearrangements of Ryoanji is not feasible. As John Cage composed his Ryonaji with chance, pencil and paper. I recompose Ryoanji exploring the limits and boundary of generative art in code. An explorations of meditation. \n\nInstead of rearranging the stones, which I have fixed, everything else is by way of chance. Original physical walls, imaginary walls, p5js raked sands, trees beyond walls, our visions we see with our mind not our eyes, elicit meditation on screen.\n\nTime to meditate and heal. \n\nPress 1 to save png.

Different theories put forward about what the garden is supposed to represent. Garden historian Gunter Nitschke wrote: \"The garden at Ryōan-ji does not symbolize anything, or more precisely, to avoid any misunderstanding, the garden of Ryōan-ji does not symbolize, nor does it have the value of reproducing a natural beauty that one can find in the real or imaginary world. I consider it to be an abstract composition of objects in space, a composition whose function is to incite “meditation”.\n\nIn the science journal Nature, Gert van Tonder and Michael Lyons analyze the rock garden by generating a model of shape analysis. Using this model, they showed that the empty space of the garden is implicitly structured, and is aligned with the temple's architecture, where the axis of symmetry passes close to the center of the main hall. The implicit structure of the garden is designed to appeal to the viewer's unconscious visual sensitivity to axial-symmetry skeletons of stimulus shapes. And found that imposing a random perturbation of the locations of individual rock features destroyed the special characteristics.\n\nBUT this is not how John Cage views the garden. \n\nCage first visited the Ryoanji Temple and rock garden in 1962, during a concert tour of Japan with David Tudor, Toshi Ichiyanagi, and Yoko Ono. Measuring 30 x 10 meters, the garden consists of carefully raked white pebbles with 15 rocks arranged. \n\nIn 1982, when Cage was commissioned to design the cover for a book to be published by Editions Ryôan-ji, as with all of his late artistic endeavors, he developed processes of chance-controlled creation, consulting the coin oracle of the I Ching and later computer-generating randomized numbers, reducing the subjective aspects of both composition and performance. Cage placed a selection of stones from his collection, positioned by chance operations, on the plate and traced their outlines. Each print’s title dictated the number of times he outlined each stone. For example, the dense, allover mesh of marks in R3 (where R=Ryoanji) represents fifteen stones, each traced 225 times to produce a total of 3,375 stone silhouettes (15 x 15 x 15 equals 3,375). \n\nOver a period of ten years, the last decade of his life, Cage devoted himself to drawings addressing the aesthetic order of the complex yet simple that is revered in Japan as a perfect depiction of nature (with Buddhism or Zen influence). “Ryoanji” compositions focus on how John Cage expressed his ideas and the garden’s sensibility in both his audio and visual interpretations.\n",

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. www.tribute-hwf.com\n\n\"Since the classical age of Greece, the golden ratio has been well known as the most balanced and therefore most aesthetically perfect proportion. In fact, it is supposedly often found in the fine arts and architecture and it is certainly important in geometry. But where is the proof that it is really the most beautiful proportion?\n\n\"The computer is proving to be a useful tool in exact art theory. Works of computer art are produced with the help of programs that describe the logic of the construction and its relevant measures. By varying the parameters you can vary the shapes of objects, and on the basis of the reaction of the public you can determine the best option. So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n\"A statistical evaluation would be interesting. Please email me with your results for the optimal proportion.\"\n\nI found it heartwarming that in 2011, Herbert W. Franke wrote the above, accompanied with a simple functional program on a Wolfram Demonstration page (https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/IsTheGoldenRatioReallyTheMostBeautifulProportion/) titled 'Is the Golden Ratio Really the Most Beautiful Proportion?' and invited people to submit their findings to him.\n\nThe main idea behind this project is ratios, a variety of them, used in a variety of ways, such as how a rectangle is repeatedly subdivided, or how it influences the aspect ratio of the piece, or how the colors in a palette are selected. These are represented in various styles, some of which are inspired by the aesthetic of Herbert W. Franke's diverse artworks, and his openness to experimentation with new technologies, such as plotter drawings, screens, screenprints, or 2D and 3D digital renderings.\n\nThis project, while not designed to be a formal statistical evaluation, is but my fun, colorful, and humble response to your inquiry, dear Herbert.\n\n---\n\n25% of primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke, with the goal of raising 20,000 Euros so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any money raised beyond this goal will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• Double-click/tap or 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n\nNote: Some mints require WEBGL and/or may take several seconds to fully render.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid",
