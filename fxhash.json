The distribution density is driven by the land heightmap.\n\n\nDeveloped with three.js using WebGLRenderer.\nRendering is faster with chrome browser.\n\n\n[s] to save a png at 2048x1536, 1536x2048, 2048x2048 (4/3, 3/4, 4/4 aspect ratio)\n[d] to save a png at 4096x3072, 3072x4096, 4096x4096 (4/3, 3/4, 4/4 aspect ratio)\n\n\nFeatures:\n\"Palette\": 14 colormaps\n\"Aspect Ratio\": 4/3, 3/4, 4/4\n\"View Point\":  Far, Medium, Near, Above\n\"Sky Type\": FBM, Gradient1, Gradient2\n\"Sky Color\": LightSkyBlue, Gray, Blue [10% probability]\n\"Bark Color\":  Brown, GrayBrown, Gray\n\"Bare Trees\": True, False\n\n\nCreated by Andrea Belloni, fxhash: anbello, twitter: @Waterflowing0.

            "description": "Verdant translates to “lush, green” and Brut means “dry, raw, or unrefined.”\n\nThis series is less about impressions of nature, or vegetal growth… but rather the vibrant, lush world that abstract art can provide and while certain iterations may serve Brutalist aesthetics, it tries to focus on the unrefined/raw aspect of the definition with more fluid shapes that feel irregular and organic in a playful, almost adolescent way.\n\nPalettes inspired by MOMO, Melissa Wiederrecht, Erik Swahn, Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, Paul Klee, Mareva Millarc, Ernst Mether-Borgström, Douglas Herbert Courtenay Auburn, Jim Harris, Alayne Spafford, Man Ray, Lajos Kassak and William Lachance. While the palettes may not always reflect their trademark colors (if they even have any) they are an homage to individual pieces by the respective artists that have influenced this series in their own way.\n\n4878 bytes of Vanilla JS with no libraries.\n\nFor more info on the chosen palettes and other inspirations, see article linked from the main project page: Regarding Verdant Brut\n\nIn live mode:\n‘S’ : save as png (2376 × 3360)\n’V’ : save as svg (without grain)\n\nURL params in live mode:\n‘g=n’ : no grain\n‘g=p’ : paper grain\n‘h=t’ : high resolution mode, 5940 × 8400 (Chrome only)\n\nFor example, if you wanted paper grain in high resolution, append “&g=p&h=t” to the url in live mode.\n\nAfter rendering with these params, tapping 'P' will then save the png with those settings applied.",

            "description": "This project is a playful attempt to depict how Neo-plasticism painters abstracted compositions, inspired and a tribute to the \"De Stijl\" movement, drawn using statically rendered block elements. The visual language reminds the original designs of famous artists of this art movement; in this project, each color palette is categorized by the name of a favorite piece of these artists. These palettes are sometimes determined by the color combination of this artist's works, which form the visual identity of their works from the color dimension.\nIn this project, different nodes are simple orthogonal shapes of color spots and thin lines to demarcate colors. I tried to create a dynamic effect by questioning the usual signs of vision in the abstract works of this period, to modify the relationship between them profoundly, and to show another field of my understanding of this movement by drawing a personal space.\nThe colors red, black, blue, and yellow were used from this turning point in the Neo-plasticism that the artists of the 'De Stijl movement cared about.\nSubtle black lines separate the vast rectangles, which for some are filled with bright or black, or gray; each small component is a member to create a whole and a single visualization, and each aspect of the components receives its visual value from the whole.\nThis work has set 27 color palettes and three variations to shape different rarities. It is better to set the browser to standard mode to see the effect better.\n\nDe Stijl\n \nThe style \"De Stijl\" of the Dutch avant-garde movement is an essential key to understanding the sources of the modern movement. The movement is organized around three central figures: the painter Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg and the furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld. Other core members are the painters Bart van der Leck, Georges Vantongerlo, and Willmus Huzar; the architects J.J.P Oud, Robert van Hoff, and Jan Wills; the poet Anthony Cook, later the graphic designer Piet Zwart and the architect Cornelis van Stern.\nIn 1918, a year after the official founding of the group and publication of the magazine's first issue that published and publicized the movement's doctrine, the creators of De Stijl combined the aesthetic and social vision. The group's first manifesto calls for a new balance between the individual and the universal and fights to free art from the limitations of the cult of individualism. \n \nDe Stijl originates both in the Hegelian tradition and in the Theosophical movement, then spreading in the Netherlands, both a utopian vision and a commitment to the production of the reality of the industrial world. However, it is a formal, plastic, pictorial, or architectural transcription of the principles of universal harmony that its creators implement. Painting, sculpture, furniture design, graphic design, architecture, and soon urban planning support this experiment, carried out simultaneously by different group creators. De Style productions naturally go beyond the traditional and academic division between primary and secondary arts, decorative arts, architecture, and urban planning.\nFrom the realm of the mind to the city, this can be the guiding thread for the evolution of the Style's productions during its fourteen years of life. The spatial nature of the work of art gradually reaches from the status of supporting the analysis of the world to a factor in building the social and political environment of the city. In this way, the spatialization of the work forms an experience of the world, gives order to the world, and gives essence to society. \nThe Style's priority is to invent an official language that responds to the challenges of the industrial society after World War I and outlines strategies for implementing the new social order.\nThe method of this vision is Neo-plasticism, which initially consists in radicalizing the approach of the contemporary avant-gardes.",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "When i first read an article about how retired New York subway cars were dropped into the Atlantic ocean to serve as man-made reefs, my first thought was: \"does the ocean truly turn them into reefs? Do they want the cars?\". And sure the ocean did. The next photos showed the subway cars rail handles and seats were all covered by barnacles and swarmed by fish. The same thing happened to the hazardous city of Pripyat. 35 years later after the reactor meltdown that resulted in city-wide evacuation, leaving buildings abandoned for years. With no presence of human lives, this gave way for the nature around it to change, some modified genetically, but a lot more now - flourish.\n\nAt the same time, humans have known how to reclaim land from the sea, terraforming hills and valleys to build structures to move people far away, open forests to grow food that will feed the growing mass, and flatten any available lands to build houses that will shelter billions. We seem to flourish even more too.\n\nWhen I created Reclaiming, I thought of nature as an entity that is neither good nor bad. Although human civilization has been advancing more than ever, it feels as if nature is indifferent to the advancement or plight of mankind, and that somehow feels reassuring. The moment we are ready to stop stacking concrete, we will see stem peeking through some cracks. The relationship of nature and humans has been an act of reclaiming parts of each other to survive. Is this humans claiming their nature, or does it belong to nature to begin with?\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Nov22",

I define a 3D object, a cube, and construct a number of cube instances into an array that floats in 3D space. Each cube consists of 6 faces, each facet colored one of the 6 \"official\" colors of the Rubik's Cube (TM) palette. Hence, each cube (voxel) represents a solved Rubiks Cube (TM) puzzle.\n\nI use a combination of functions to control the rotation of each cube in its relative position in the array. As each cube is rotated you can see its various colored faces. I maintain the cubes' proper visibility by eliminating the facets of the cube that face away from the viewer, i.e., back face culling.\n\nTo quote my collaborator and friend Chris Scussel: \"I just LOVE the secondary patterns created by the gradual turning of the cubes!  The curves appear and disappear as one looks around the image. Interesting and fun!\" \n\n(c)2022 Dr.Bill Kolomyjec. All rights reserved.\n\nPlease visit www.drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Uninhabitable is a generative system built only from ellipses. The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state. Press \"h\" to save it.\n\nUninhabitable is an original work by Iskra Velitchkova. 2021.",
