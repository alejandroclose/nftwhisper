            "description": "A collaboration between leading British high-end audio brand KEF, generative artist hieroglyphica, and creative studio Parameta, Absorbed embodies the process of noise becoming high-fidelity sound through KEF‚Äôs Metamaterial Absorption Technology (MAT‚Ñ¢). \n\nMAT‚Ñ¢ makes the KEF sound what it is: absorbing unwanted distortion to deliver pure, accurate sound exactly as the artist intended. Inspired by this intricacy, Absorbed illustrates pseudorandom networks of patterns, slowly emerging and transforming into the maze-like form of MAT‚Ñ¢. Clarity is revealed, noise is absorbed ‚Äì high-fidelity is found.\n\nThe noise fields used in Absorbed are of two distinct types: conventional gradient noise and ‚Äúsinusoidal‚Äù noise, an original algorithm developed for this series. The use of animation as artistic medium reflects the artists‚Äô belief that no single frame can capture the full range of complexity found in the tension between sound and noise, and lets collectors observe for themselves this ever-shifting dialogue. A more extensive discussion of the algorithms used in Absorbed can be found in hieroglyphica‚Äôs companion article on fx(text).\n\n- spacebar will pause and resume the animation\n- s will save a still image of the current frame\n- technically minded collectors can consult the index.html file for info on how to render and save high-resolution images\n- use of hardware acceleration in Chrome may impact performance\n\nFounded by BBC engineer Raymond Cooke in 1961, KEF is a leading British innovator of high-end audio products including HiFi speakers, subwoofers, architectural speakers, wireless speaker-systems, and headphones.

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. ‚ÄúThe Bugged Tree‚Äù‚Äôs code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren‚Äôt under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there‚Äôs a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "üéß CLICK/TAP FOR SOUND ON\n\nSa·πÖkhƒÅra is a portrait of symbolic consciousness in three movements.\n\nColorful automata represents direct experience: touch, sight, hearing, smell, taste and thought in a ceaseless flow of novelty.\n\nThe automata congeals into form alluding to the way our minds close over experience with symbolic representation, like a plastic bag coming down over a kaleidoscope of butterflies. What was free in the open air is now trapped. What was previously wild and unpredictable is now under control, frozen and communicable.\n\nThe form‚Äôs dispersal mimics the release of mental formation, the unbinding of a symbol, the letting go of a belief. It‚Äôs a visceral reflection of the process of ceasing to identify with separateness. To strain the previous metaphor, it‚Äôs the opening of the bag and letting the butterflies return to the flow of raw, boundless experience.\n\n‚Äî\n\nK.C. Austin\nFrom his cockpit in the Blue Ridge Mountains K.C. Austin (aka bzor) spends his days shaping realtime software art systems of all stripes. Informed by game design, modular synths, virtual reality and consciousness research, K.C. plays shaders like a fiddle and fashions creative pipelines like a spider spins webs.\n\nJames Paterson\nFascinated by the relationship between ancient and futuristic mediums, James Paterson has been exploring a unique synthesis of drawing, code, animation and sculpture under the moniker ‚ÄòPresstube‚Äô since 1999. Paterson draws inspiration from meditation, molecular biology, music, parenting and psychedelics - the seen, the heard, the felt, the cognized.",
