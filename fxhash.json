            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "A soundscape of synthwave music built using JS. Generates a looped sequence of notes played by a polyphonic synthesizer, with a random selection of scales and beats per minute. Features Mr.Whiskers on synth on a white canvas and one other color chosen from a palette of seven colors. The colors in the palette are variations of black or blue. \n\nThe code defines several pitch sets, including major and minor scales, pentatonic scales, and whole-half diminished scales, and randomly selects one of these sets to use as the basis for the loop (total of 19 scales). The loop is generated using a 16-step grid, with each step representing an eighth note. At each step, the code randomly enables or disables cells in the grid, and if a cell is enabled, the code plays a note on the synthesizer corresponding to the pitch of that cell. The code also randomly changes the beats per minute (bpm) within a range of 120-180 bpm. This creates a sense of variation in the tempo, and combined with the randomization of the scale, can lead to an infinite number of variations. Regardless of its starting point, your distinctive version will maintain a consistent pitch set and bpm throughout.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nTo interact with the artwork:\n- Start the music by either pressing the 'm' key or clicking anywhere on the canvas.\n- No sight of Mr. Whiskers? No need to worry! Just hit the \"c\" key to bring him forth!\n- To make Mr. Whiskers disappear, simply press the \"x\" key \n- Hit the \"d\" key to either open or close the portal\n- To pause and restart the music, press the \"z\" key.\n- To save a snapshot of the current image, press \"p\" and it will be saved as a PNG file. \n- For an SVG file of the original image, press \"s\".\n- There is a possibility of encountering problems with the rendering on certain mobile devices.\n_____________________________________________\n\nretr0metr0, San Francisco, May 2023.\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0.\n",

            "description": "GuilCity is the beginning of an exciting journey bringing Guillaume Cornet’s densely-packed cities into the generative realm with the help of Matthew’s (@frostbitten’s) magic touch.\n\nMatthew—with his background in coding and animation—enables a new opportunity to experience these cities like never before. Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey! \n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you’ve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n—\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n—\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n• https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n—\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others’ skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci à tous!
