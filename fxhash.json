            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "ARTIST:  Geneva Lee Robles\n\nMEDIUM: This work is an image composition with generative elements. The underlying image is a handmade linocut print whose parts were deconstructed via powerpoint, and pixel arrays processed via p5js. In this debut collection, the artist utilizes traditional and digital mediums to convey the feeling of simplicity and chaos.           \n\nTHE ART: “The Weight” is an award winner for the New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA) NFT Award Program.  Inspired by bridging traditional art and technology, subsequent iterations of the work utilize coded generative elements to enhance its story.  \n\nEXHIBITION: “THE WEIGHT” is a part of “Demystifying NFTs: The Award Exhibition”, on display in Voxel’s Metaverse at the BRIDGE ++ space from December 15th - December 31st, 2022, curated by Laura Ó Reilly and presented by NYFA. \n\nBEHIND THE ART: Weight is a recurring theme in the artist’s work, depicted metaphorically as she revisits the emotional turbulence she experienced as a child of Chinese and Puerto Rican descent, raised in a home of heroin addiction and chaos. The weight tells the story of the heaviness we carry in life, and our resilience to keep going in spite of its persistence.  \n\nABOUT THE ARTIST:  Geneva Lee Robles is an interdisciplinary artist, living in New York City.  She was born in the Bronx and raised in Brooklyn, NY, during a tumultuous period in the 1980s.  Her work attempts to capture the emotional turbulence one is feeling, when no one is watching. She explores themes of loneliness within one's self and their relationships.  She is inspired by integrating traditional forms of art and pushing the envelope of what's possible through technology. \n\nCOLLECTORS RIGHTS: Includes the permission to digitally exhibit in galleries, museums and the collector’s home.  This does not include the right to print or duplicate the work for commercial purposes.  If interested in purchasing additional rights, please contact the artist through her website at www.genevaleerobles.com.  \n\nDIGITAL CONSERVATION: Please contact the artist for a checksums of the underlying source files. \n\nCOLLECTOR KIT: Includes an archival file, the right to purchase a high quality print of the NFT on archival paper, a  text document containing a description of the work. Please contact the artist through her website: www.genevaleerobles.com within 90 days of the primary sale of the work. \n\nPAYOUT ADDRESS: Genevaleerobles.tez\n\nEXHIBITION: \t“Demystifying NFTs: The Award Exhibition”\nWHERE:\t\tVoxel’s Metaverse at the BRIDGE ++  \nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/experience-demystifying-nftsthe-award-exhibition-inside-voxels-metaverse-tickets-483353141257\n\nChaShaMa\n266 W 37th St.\nNew York, NY 10018\n\nON DISPLAY:  \tDecember 15th - December 31st, 2022\nCURATED BY:\tLaura Ó Reilly\nPRESENTED BY: \tNew York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA)\n",

            "description": "The world shifts into chaos, which we then attempt to correct. Chaos is the world's natural state. Similar to how a strong emote slowly defends itself until a new one \"corrects\" its direction. Simply put, this is entropy as defined by thermodynamics.\nOrder is free will; chaos is fate. We are all drawn to fate in some way, that instinctive desire to watch a fire burn. Every single one of us is just as wired for order as for chaos.\nMaintaining order requires work, sacrifice, and effort. The beauty of letting go of inhibitions and returning to our more primal fascination is intoxicating in chaos where we only need to exist.\n\nAnd that almost acts as our adrenaline, reflecting on everyone. A chaotic environment might energize them, release all those feel-good brain chemicals, and actually make them feel good.\nAnother thing to consider is that most creative work is chaotic and random, and most artists intentionally introduce chaos or randomness into their work in order to find fresh \"opportunities\" and rekindle their creativity. You must constantly use new colors if you want to keep the world colorful. A world of white and black can be creative; a world of blue and red cannot. Using the same colors repeatedly in a \"imitative\" manner will only kill it.\nChaos gives life more color, possibilities, chances, and opportunities, and it's full of pleasant and unpleasant surprises. People have become so dumb and lazy that they are no longer able to make the best of both bad and positive circumstances and events.\n\nWait a moment it takes a while to be rendered\n---\nCreated using vanilla javascript\nKrouniHatim - Nov22\n---\n(CC BY-ND 4.0)",

            "description": "In 1934, German philosopher Max Bense published his first work “Raum und Ich” (Space & Ego) where he explored the concept of ‘information aesthetics’, proposing that the aesthetic value of an artwork could be derived from its underlying informational structure. \n\nBense asserted that \"Space\" extends beyond physical dimensions into the realm of abstract ideas, mathematical possibilities, and the unseen information shaping an artwork, while acknowledging its potential, boundaries, and prospects.\n\nThe term \"ego,\" usually associated with an artist's subjective impulses and emotional idiosyncrasies, is redefined in Bense's framework. As technology and information theory become integrated into artistic creation, the artist's role changes from a subjective creator to an architect of information and systems.\n\nThirty years later Manfred Mohr, an abstract expressionist, discovered Bense's information aesthetics in early 60’s, and his artistic thinking changed radically. Within a few years, his art transformed to computer generated algorithmic geometry. A pioneer of generative art, Mohr relentlessly explored precise geometric forms, symmetry, and a mathematical approach to art. \n\nWhile Bense’s work continues to provide a philosophical foundation and conceptual framework for generative art, Mohr demonstrated the power of computational processes to produce intellectually engaging artworks. The series 'Space & Ego' pays homage to both Bense and Mohr while initiating a dialogue. \n\nRooted in Mohr's concept of a random point within a square, this series broadens the \"space\" made possible by evolution of generative art. While the plotters of the 1960s were confined to monochromatic outputs, I have experimented with palettes uncommon in plotter projects. My choice of colors was expressive and more in tradition with abstract expressionists of 1960s. \n\nA random point is selected within a square, and the four resulting polygons are filled with lines. The probability of these polygons being filled with lines follows four approaches, ascending and descending from top-left to bottom-right (and vice versa), and radial expansion outward (and vice versa). All works can be plotted and have been designed for a precise fill of colors within the polygons. \n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a PNG of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete SVG file for plotting. \n\nAnd this is a redeemable project in case you’d like to receive a physical plot! \n\nPixel Love!",

            "description": "SCHNEEWALD is the second release in a row of about 12 tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years.\n\nThis project explores an approach to trees with snow using a recursive algorithm and includes Three traits: a density layer for the amount of trees and another layer for the amount snow and a third for how strong the branches bend.\n\nRendering progress indicated on the top left border\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png\n\nArtist notes:\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nI experienced it in all sorts of seasonal change, packed with snow is definitely among the most amazing! \n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: https://e-art.co/project/schneewald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND",

            "description": "“Southern Gothic” is my debut release on the fxhash platform. The project is created entirely through code. All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n“Southern Gothic” borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",

            "description": "I started this work as an introspection to my comprehension on the book of Wumen Guan (無門關), the gateless barrier. \n\nA question posed by zen master, Wumen Huikai (無門慧開), to whether there was a gate, at a given barrier, where one would wish to pass? There were, of course, infinite many ways to compose such a paradox. \n\nAs I explored through different forms and composition, the gates had become either hearts and/or eyes looking upon us. The barrier (關 guan), a type of blockade of something, effectively became a perspective, (觀 guan), the watching over of some things with love.  \n\nI realized, it was then trivial to debate whether and how such gates exist. And whether something in the sky was flying in and out of gates or non gates, is no more significant than if they were only the teardrops of someone, watching over us, cheering us on. The answer was a simple question of love. \n\nPress 1 to save png. Chrome only. Preview images are compressed.",

            "description": "De/Frag is an homage to a classic algorithm in early computer art: Flood Fill. As a teenager in the late '80s, and without any literature, I spent weeks implementing a version for my very own drawing program for the Atari XL. It was the first non-trivial (to me) algorithm which made me want to learn more about data structures, the concept of recursion, divide-and-conquer...\n\nEven though Flood Fill was available in most commercial drawing & office apps of the time, I gained a deep appreciation of the algorithm by building it from scratch myself. 30+ years later I know its aesthetic possibilities are still far from exhausted. This is an invitation for re-exploration by others too!\n\nAs with many design algorithms, my primary interest isn't even the final result, but observing the inner workings. I massively slowed down and time-sliced the process for this piece. I do recommend giving each of these unique versions some time to allow them to evolve their ever-changing patterns (Note: each piece never loops!).",
