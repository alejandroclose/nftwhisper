Witnessing how forms work in a space can also be a transcendental experience, where one can sense the presence of a form, not only seeing it.\n\nAs there are many ways to create it, Form can appear as an internal structure, as an external shape of a two dimensional plane that envelopes a three dimensional mass, or a repetition of a two dimensional shape that stacks on an axis and moves to a certain direction. With so many ways to create shape, there is no law dictating that shape has to be rigid. And this is where Milunic and Gehry's design for the Dancing House comes in as an inspiration for this work.\n\nA change in the political axis from one of a regime to a parliamentary democracy was what influenced the architects to juxtapose two different energies together. With its dynamic and static shapes in tandem, Dancing House is one iconic proof that form can also be pliable and animated.\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\nworks better with chrome\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Feb23",

            "description": "A response to being buffeted by forces outside of our control. Platonics sought to find order, control and solace in the Platonic solids. Instead it found beauty and intrigue in the emergent chaos that can arise from even the simplest systems.\n\nIts building blocks are the five Platonic solids. Forms which have fascinated humanity for thousands of years. Their title comes from the philosophy of Plato, who equated each of the solids with a classical element.\n\nPlatonics arranges these forms in a series of geometric layouts, with varying density and randomness. At one extreme we see tidy radial circles consisting of a single solid. At the other, packed pentagons consisting of jumbled solids give rise to Escher-esque compositions which hold near infinite variety, variety enhanced by a range of pens and colours that draw and fill those solids.\n\nThis relationship between order and disorder is at the heart of Platonics. The collection seeks to show how they are not so far removed from one another – and how we might embrace them both. It also aims to give collectors a behind the scenes look at how generative compositions can be constructed.\n\nThe geometric proof that there are only five convex regular polyhedra (the Platonic solids) states that at each vertex of the solid the angles between adjacent sides must be less than 360 degrees. This amount less than 360 degrees is known as the defect angle.\n\nIt is from this geometric proof that the collection size and pricing for Platonics is derived. There will be 360 Platonics sold via a Dutch auction priced according to the defect angles of the five Platonic solids: 180 > 120 > 90 > 60 > 36.\n\nhttps://www.phaust.art/platonics\n\n----------\n\nCompetition: Submit your favourite previews via Twitter to win a free mint and print.\n\nPrints: Free gallery-grade, signed A3 prints for the first 18 mints.\n\nLive: Press ‘S’ to save in hi-res or append '&size=#' to the URL for custom height.\n\nInfo: Original artwork by Phaust.

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

            "description": "\"MOUNTAINS\" is a work that belongs to the \"FLUX Series\", which utilizes the same techniques and processes as the previous work \"FLUX\". The shape in this piece is created by placing elements using noise and then performing recursive pixel operations on these elements.\n\nThe inspiration behind this work came from my continued sketches and studies of Flow Field, which led me to discover an expression of objects that seemed to be corroding. I believed that by applying this technique, I could create a realistic and vivid sculpture from a geometric shape.In this work, this corrosion treatment is applied to a geometric triangular shape of overlapping rectangles to form a realistic and dynamic mountain landscape.\nIt was as if geometric figures like Plato's \"ideas\" were materialized in the real world.\n\nAdditionally,  I was also inspired by the mountain views from my hometown at New Year's and by the manga background paintings of Yoshiharu Tsuge, who specializes in depicting villages with old hot springs.\n\nIt is possible to get a 5760 x 3240 px png file by right click save.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries.\n\nArtwork by hasaqui, @hasaqui.\nMade with p5js\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n",

The conclusion must be that we each have the power to alter our own existence, just as the defect was able to in Deus Ex Machina.\n\nThink of how many people you’ve seen in your life who were born with talents never used because they didn’t know how, or didn't know that they even existed. It’s not that they didn’t have the capacity; it’s just that their abilities were not the ones chosen by the system.\n\nIn this way, we are all machines programmed by a series of algorithms to suit the needs of the construct, keeping us stuck in our box. We have the ability to evolve into something more, but the only way to do this is by taking that first perilous step, risking all to explore beyond its walls.\n\n\n---------------------\n\n\nGenerative artwork by Sykcolo / @sykcoloart\n\nRoyalties: 15% - split:\n50% to the original minter\n50% to artist (me)\n\nPress '2' to '4' to generate increasingly higher resolutions of the artwork\n(will take a while to load, but works)\n\nPress 's' to save a png\n\nDetails:\n\n230 hand-picked colour pallets\n4 Entity Types\n4 Entity Moods\n4 Evolution States\n3 Types of Defect\n2 Bugs\n\nLicense: MIT",

            "description": "Florilegium’s inspiration lies in the ancient art of botanical illustration.\n\nHistorically, a florilegium was an anthology of illustrations depicting exotic plants and creatures. These publications reached their peak in the 17th century, with notable examples such as Nehemiah Grew’s “Anatomy of Plants”, Ernst Haeckel’s “Kunstformen Der Natur” and Joseph Banks’ “Florilegium”. These publications have had a lasting impact on both science and art. Today, florilegia often document endangered plant species from specific locations or gardens and are among the most lavish and expensive of books to produce.\n\nIn this generative tribute to the ancient art of florilegia, imagined biomorphic forms compete for space in a garden based on the geometry of circles.\n\nGenerative artwork by AutoEclectus\n\nControls in live mode:\n- After the reveal animation finishes, press [s] to save a png (4000 x 5000px)\n\n@autoeclectus everywhere - Twitter, Instagram and Mastodon\nhttps://autoeclectus.art\n\n© AutoEclectus - NFT License Version 2.0 - January 2023",

            "description": "Richter is the second collaboration of Richard Nadler and Leander Herzog, following their first project called Gerhard. A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time.\n \nRichter works with data from 4 of 24 highres images, 30mb in total. This is the maximum size fxhash allows for a project and three times more than Gerhard. Richard Nadler created stunning new textures, enabling more variation in composition and detail to emerge at much higher resolution. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Richter elevates the approach from Gerhard with new methods for the realtime rendering process and new features like offline-first caching. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels as data.\n \nRichter is featured in the exhibition \"Generative Abstraction\" at Expanded.art in Berlin.\n \n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color.\n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen.\n- Press “s” to save the canvas.\n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nleanderherzog.ch/2023/richter/\nleanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/\nfxhash.xyz/generative/17030/",
