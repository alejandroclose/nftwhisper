            "description": "Barriers is an artwork+data visualization about the state of LGBT+ rights across the world.\n\nEach edition is assigned 1 out of 197 countries. Four basic LGBT+ rights are represented as circles with barriers. The largest circle signifies whether homosexual activity is legal. The second-largest signifies same-sex marriage. The third one, same-sex adoption. The smallest one is the legality of gender change. One barrier means full rights. The more barriers, the more unequal rights are afforded to LGBT+ people.\n\nThe colors of the edition signify the country’s region and subregion.\n\nThe artwork adapts to different screen sizes and ratios, so I recommend exploring it on various devices or resizing your browser window.\n\n· Interactions in-depth ·\n\nDesktop - S for save / D for dark mode / A for animate again\n\nMobile - Long press for save / Double tap for dark mode / Quadruple tap for animate again\n\nCreated using p5js and FettePalette.

            "description": "\"In the year of 3023 the planet Earth from which all humans descend, today is called 'EARTH01', it is so called because it was the first planet to be completely destroyed by humanity. During the last few years of this planet's existence, the human race used all its resources to find new habitable planets and ways to reach them.\n\nAfter long years of tireless research, they began to discover new places where they could survive and explore, and thus they migrated from planet to planet and formed human colonies for thousands of years. Then one day some of them arrived on a new planet to begin their colonization, in this place they found trees very similar to the ones they knew, through ancient records of their ancestors, to have existed on EARTH01.\n\nBut unlike the trees on EARTH01, these were gigantic and instead of just fruit, some species also produced many types of important resources for human survival, such as water (extracted from some types of fruit), and even precious ores similar to of your home planet. To grow and survive, trees needed nothing more than a specific light from that solar system, which was very plentiful on that planet. These trees were then named 'Bellatrix', which in Latin (an almost lost language of EARTH01) meant 'warrior'.\n\nWith this discovery they thought had in their hands an infinite power, and so they began the same cycle done on all other planets, sucking all possible resources without thinking about the possibility of them having an end.\nAfter a few hundred years the planet began to crumble due to exploitation, and all the chaos caused by humans due to their greed and selfishness turned against them. Few Bellatrixes were left alive, the few existing rivers on the planet dried up, the woods and forests before full of life and those wonderful trees, no longer existed...\n\nSociety was in decline, laws no longer had effect on this civilization, there were groups of marauders, living there was no longer something safe. That planet full of life was now a desert planet, surrounded by sand dunes that swallowed the ruins of ancient buildings.\nIt was then that people realized that the same mistake had been made for all these thousands of years, generation after generation, no matter how fertile the new planet was, humanity always managed to deplete it and its resources.

Then one day some of them arrived on a new planet to begin their colonization, in this place they found trees very similar to the ones they knew, through ancient records of their ancestors, to have existed on EARTH01.\n\nBut unlike the trees on EARTH01, these were gigantic and instead of just fruit, some species also produced many types of important resources for human survival, such as water (extracted from some types of fruit), and even precious ores similar to of your home planet. To grow and survive, trees needed nothing more than a specific light from that solar system, which was very plentiful on that planet. These trees were then named 'Bellatrix', which in Latin (an almost lost language of EARTH01) meant 'warrior'.\n\nWith this discovery they thought had in their hands an infinite power, and so they began the same cycle done on all other planets, sucking all possible resources without thinking about the possibility of them having an end.\nAfter a few hundred years the planet began to crumble due to exploitation, and all the chaos caused by humans due to their greed and selfishness turned against them.

            "description": "There is something almost subversive about generative art that mimics nature. Rather than excelling at abstract mathematical beauty, it tries to hold the complexity and elegance of the natural world, all while attempting to be interesting art. This makes it a different kind of challenge than the mathematical attractors and flow fields that are common across generative art.\n\nIt may be ironic then that the solution to natural forms is very often mathematical. The trees in this work are built recursively as a graph, much like how one could build a fractal. But chaos is mixed in at each step to allow the shapes to vary, and reduce their self-similarity. This is a different approach to L-systems but the results are very similar.\n\nIn this token, there are:\n - Three styles of tree.\n - Twelve colour schemes (six day, six night)\n - Four shapes for leaves.\n - Five leaf patterns\n - And other entropy that cannot be enumerated.",

Keep in mind that this will result in a slightly different image, but colors/shapes/general layout will remain the same. The default size is 2048x2048.\n\n@teaboswell, 2022\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt",
