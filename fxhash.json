            "description": "\"I never wanted color to be color. I never wanted texture to be texture, or images to become shapes. I wanted them all to fuse together into a living spirit.\" - Clyfford Still\n\n\nI have spent most of my life residing in urban environments. While figurative art is not a style I typically pursue in my own work, I delight in discovering abstract elements within it. The cities I've inhabited have consistently offered me the chance to do so through their architectural landscapes.\n\nLe Corbusier once said that a metropolis's abstract skyline serves as its autobiography, etched in steel and glass, unveiling its history, character, and ambitions. In this series, my aim has been to encapsulate that sentiment using a minimalistic canvas and a monochromatic palette. Abstract expressionism remains my lens for viewing every artwork. \n\nThe style of this series is my homage to Clyfford Still, an abex artist I have always admired. His ability to convey profound meaning through seemingly empty and unfilled canvases has always intrigued me. \n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress s to save the image in full screen. \n\nPixel Love!",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens —created in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco— that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking “what if” questions such as “What if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?” Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road —one direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature— it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario’s thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",

            "description": "The Last Days of Fire and Steel uses a stippling, pointillist technique to build up an image over three hundred and sixty frames of animation, pushing approximately half-a-million dots to the canvas in that time. Each point's position, size, opacity and hue is controlled by the algorithm, shaped by the manipulation and constraint of random numbers.\n\nFive noise fields are selected, their density and influence on the final piece chosen from carefully-curated ranges. Structures, lighting, sky events and foreground structures are also generated using random values.\n\nSky\n\nThe main render—the overwhelming majority of the pointillist dots—can be weighted in numerous directions, lighting the sky to the left, right or perhaps centrally. Clouds are formed from the other four noise fields, which are rendered in smaller, tighter groups.\n\nWater\n\nThe bottom half of the picture is dedicated to a body of water, usually in the same main colour as the sky. Dot-size and density are altered towards the bottom of the piece, providing a slight feel of perspective. Additionally, dimming effects are overlaid near to the centre of the piece to subtly enhance the feeling of depth.\n\nStructures\n\nThe buildings—which include cuboids, spires, girders and domes—are shifted slightly over time to allow their edges to blur. Sometimes they are rotated slightly, sometimes the girders will feature small, pinpoint lights that activate towards the end of the render. Very rarely the landscape will be flat and featureless: all buildings gone. There's also a rare chance of a blurred foreground overlay of twisted girders, crooked fence posts or metal posts.\n\nSky Events\n\nComets, missiles, or falling satellites: whatever they are, they descend over the render, shifting slightly under the influence of gravity. Dark streaks may also traverse the sky: a seeking craft, perhaps, or something more sinister. They advance towards a central point. There is a rare chance of a meteor burst or what must be some kind of scramble: up to eight aircraft speeding to a common destination.\nStars, explosions, supernovae or distant moons illuminate the sky, sometimes as an inverted, dense point of light, other times as a halo of frosty moonglow. A rare chance of a full-spectrum rainbow star is there.\n\nSound\n\nIn a first for a Mandy Brigwell artwork, I've included a soundtrack for this piece. A moody, ambient layering of analogue synth and percussion can be activated by the viewer, enhancing the experience of the artwork. Sound must be activated by the user: press [I] for details.\n\nPost-Render Effects\n\nThe render is complete after three hundred and sixty frames, but some render effects continue for a further two thousand or so frames, gently fading away to nothing. This prevents a sudden completion of the work, and is included with display in mind.\n\nInteractivity\n\nPress [I] for details. Double-click to go fullscreen.",

Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the third in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nSquare Planets consists of four layers of squares contained within a background square superimposed on top of one another. Each layer is translated from the previous layer but still lies within its boundaries. The background color of each layer is random and its set of squares are another random color. The squares that make up layers two and three are rotated either clockwise or counter-clockwise some random number of degrees within a predetermined range. \n\nThere are many Gestalt interactions within this piece. Layers (square planets) interact with each other in interesting ways. Each new generation with its random color assignments significantly affect your depth perception. Layers appear to come forward or recede. Sometimes there is more \"after-imagism\" between the square sets. Candy for your mind.",

            "description": "According to Kandinsky, painting “can create the same energies in the observer that music can make in the listener. The abstract painter is an echo seeker: just like the relationship between music and the listener, shapes and colors must penetrate the observer's soul. They vibrate the threads of his existence and resonate in the depths of his mind, you can still find references to people, buildings, mountains, etc., but these are more signs than manifestations. They do not evoke objects but abstractly reveal them, like the simplified image we have seen before of objects and elements in nature.\nClassical philosophy reinforces the belief that existing, tangible reality is a mask for a deeper reality that can only be reached through imagination. I have tried to combine this with the art of coding and creating canvases of millions of characters and numbers.\nMade in p5js\nCreated July 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "“Klyft” is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at PARIS+ par Art Basel.\n\nKlyft is a juxtaposition of two different projections for the future. One, made by the World Economic Forum, suggests that the global gender gap will have closed by the year 2154. The other, by the UN IPCC, estimates that global warming will reach 3.2 degrees celcius by the year 2100.\n\nKlyft makes use of the unique temporal aspect of computational art by developing its expression gradually over the next 132 years. As we come closer to 2154, the space between the two shapes in Klyft will grow smaller to symbolize the closing of the gender gap. As time goes on, however, Klyft also becomes more and more glitched out to represent the projected increases in greenhouse gases and climate catastrophes.\n\nIn the end, Klyft’s expression will be heavily corrupted, and the two shapes will have reached each other.\n\n· URL parameters ·\n\nYou can add the following parameters to the URL to change the behavior of the piece.\n\ndate=<YYYY-MM-DD> — See how Klyft looks on another day. Use the format YYYY-MM-DD. \n\ncolor=<number> — See the piece in another color scheme. The numbers loop around, so 17 equals 0, 18 equals 1, etc. \n\nresolution=<number> — View the piece in a higher resolution. 1 is normal resolution, 2 is double, etc. No decimals allowed.\n\nimage=true — Save the piece as an image. \n\nrecord=true — Save the piece as a video in WEBM format.\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will show Klyft in double resolution on the day gender equality is achieved according to the WEF:\n\ndate=2154-01-01&resolution=2\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will save a video of Klyft in the ‘Stokkendahl Dalgas’ color scheme:\n\ncolor=14&record=true\n\n· Interactions ·\n\nPressing the following keys will trigger functionality as well as add related URL parameters automatically. \n\nPressing D will increment the date by 1 year.\n\nPressing C will increment the color index by 1.\n\nPressing R will toggle between normal and double resolution.\n\nPressing I will toggle the image URL parameter, which saves the piece as an image. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nPressing V will toggle the video URL parameter, which saves the piece as a video. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nThere are secret key presses as well. Some of them only work outside of iframe. \n\n· Accessibility ·\n\nKlyft is built to support screen readers. It has been tested using MacOS’ VoiceOver, and uses p5.js’ describeElement() to provide screen reader functionality.\n\nIf you have any comments (good or bad) on the screen reader integration, don’t hesitate to reach out on my Twitter: @ada_ada_ada_art. \n\n· Credits and license ·\n\nKlyft is made with p5.js.\n\nKlyft is licensed under a modified version of the Climate Strike License (CSL).",
