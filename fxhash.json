The focus will be on using these shapes and patterns to create dynamic and visually interesting compositions, both in 2D and 3D forms. The project begins by studying the use of grids and how they can be used to create structure and balance in a composition. Next, the use of cubes will be examined, and how they can be used to add depth and dimension to a composition. Finally, the project will delve into the use of patterns and how they can be used to create movement and interest within a composition.",
