            "description": "\"the Pazyryk\"\n\"In the years 1326 to 1328 of the Solar Hijri calendar (equivalent to 1947â€“1949 AD), during a time when the Pazyryk carpet, the world's oldest known carpet, was discovered by Sergei Rudenko, a Russian archaeologist, in the Pazyryk Valley. This woolen carpet, adorned with vibrant colors, depicts images of horse riders, grazing deer, and mythical creatures.\n\nIn 'the Pazyryk' collection, inspired by the Pazyryk carpet and the exquisite artistry of carpets and kilims from the eastern regions, an exceptional display of the essence of color in abstract art has emerged. This collection has transformed into a comprehensive exhibition of timeless historical and artistic endeavors, offering viewers an innovative and profound experience through a wide spectrum of colors and artistic creativity.\n\nThe Pazyryk collection has been meticulously designed using 153 different color palettes and three distinct sizes with high resolution suitable for printing. This collection aims to present the colors, essence, and art of the eastern regions to the audience. Each color palette acts as a testimony to the amalgamation of emotions and insights of prominent artists throughout art history. Every color palette has been meticulously derived from the works of these famous artists, representing a fusion of interpretation and personal perspective. These palettes convey an abstract representation of artistic and technological trends, where color and coding techniques blend harmoniously.\n\nBy merging historical art with contemporary innovations, The Pazyryk reflects a living connection between the history of art and contemporary artistic currents. In this piece, I have endeavored to provide the audience with an abstract bridge for a deeper understanding of new art and creativity. Just as sunlight rapidly and captivatingly reflects off stained glass windows of eastern palaces, spreading a unique tapestry of light and shadow on the walls and floors, The Pazyryk conveys a distinctive experience of art and history through the rare abstraction of color and light. Each color palette simultaneously encapsulates a visualization of history and contemporary reflections, inviting us to a mesmerizing celebration of colors and forms.\n\n-\"To propagate the essence of My wonderful community, 50% of the royalty from each secondary sale will be attributed to minters.\"\n\nNOTE: \"This code follows a complex algorithm for its creation, so you may need to wait a bit for each result to load.

Places where rock conforms to nature's laws and unwittingly generates a pleasing landscape. And on the hex grids of the tabletop games that I used to spend hours pushing miniatures around on. This kind of landscape evokes, for me, possibilities for play and enjoyment, where it is always possible that something new and unexpected may be discovered. So I have created rules that I hope may generate something that inspires those feelings.\n\nFeatures:\nHex Size: 20, 30, 50 or 70\nPalette: Twenty one possible palettes.\nAspect Ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.6, 1.6:1\n\n\nThe work will initially render with a short edge of 1000 pixels. \n\nControls:\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels.\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels.\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels.\n[s] Save at current resolution.\n\n\nMade with javascript and p5.js.

Places where rock conforms to nature's laws and unwittingly generates a pleasing landscape. And on the hex grids of the tabletop games that I used to spend hours pushing miniatures around on. This kind of landscape evokes, for me, possibilities for play and enjoyment, where it is always possible that something new and unexpected may be discovered. So I have created rules that I hope may generate something that inspires those feelings.\n\nFeatures:\nHex Size: 20, 30, 50 or 70\nPalette: Twenty one possible palettes.\nAspect Ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.6, 1.6:1\n\n\nThe work will initially render with a short edge of 1000 pixels. \n\nControls:\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels.\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels.\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels.\n[s] Save at current resolution.\n\n\nMade with javascript and p5.js.

Places where rock conforms to nature's laws and unwittingly generates a pleasing landscape. And on the hex grids of the tabletop games that I used to spend hours pushing miniatures around on. This kind of landscape evokes, for me, possibilities for play and enjoyment, where it is always possible that something new and unexpected may be discovered. So I have created rules that I hope may generate something that inspires those feelings.\n\nFeatures:\nHex Size: 20, 30, 50 or 70\nPalette: Twenty one possible palettes.\nAspect Ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.6, 1.6:1\n\n\nThe work will initially render with a short edge of 1000 pixels. \n\nControls:\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels.\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels.\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels.\n[s] Save at current resolution.\n\n\nMade with javascript and p5.js.

            "description": "\"the Pazyryk\"\n\"In the years 1326 to 1328 of the Solar Hijri calendar (equivalent to 1947â€“1949 AD), during a time when the Pazyryk carpet, the world's oldest known carpet, was discovered by Sergei Rudenko, a Russian archaeologist, in the Pazyryk Valley. This woolen carpet, adorned with vibrant colors, depicts images of horse riders, grazing deer, and mythical creatures.\n\nIn 'the Pazyryk' collection, inspired by the Pazyryk carpet and the exquisite artistry of carpets and kilims from the eastern regions, an exceptional display of the essence of color in abstract art has emerged. This collection has transformed into a comprehensive exhibition of timeless historical and artistic endeavors, offering viewers an innovative and profound experience through a wide spectrum of colors and artistic creativity.\n\nThe Pazyryk collection has been meticulously designed using 153 different color palettes and three distinct sizes with high resolution suitable for printing. This collection aims to present the colors, essence, and art of the eastern regions to the audience. Each color palette acts as a testimony to the amalgamation of emotions and insights of prominent artists throughout art history. Every color palette has been meticulously derived from the works of these famous artists, representing a fusion of interpretation and personal perspective. These palettes convey an abstract representation of artistic and technological trends, where color and coding techniques blend harmoniously.\n\nBy merging historical art with contemporary innovations, The Pazyryk reflects a living connection between the history of art and contemporary artistic currents. In this piece, I have endeavored to provide the audience with an abstract bridge for a deeper understanding of new art and creativity. Just as sunlight rapidly and captivatingly reflects off stained glass windows of eastern palaces, spreading a unique tapestry of light and shadow on the walls and floors, The Pazyryk conveys a distinctive experience of art and history through the rare abstraction of color and light. Each color palette simultaneously encapsulates a visualization of history and contemporary reflections, inviting us to a mesmerizing celebration of colors and forms.\n\n-\"To propagate the essence of My wonderful community, 50% of the royalty from each secondary sale will be attributed to minters.\"\n\nNOTE: \"This code follows a complex algorithm for its creation, so you may need to wait a bit for each result to load.
