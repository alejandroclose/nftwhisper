            "description": "And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses\nHad the look of flowers that are looked at.\n- T.S. Eliot, Four Quartets: Burnt Norton (1936)\n\nThis work is an attempt to encapsulate in an algorithm, not the likeness of a flower, but the likeness of a painting of a flower. If, according to a very old definition, art is an imitation of nature, this is an imitation of an imitation – a sort of meta-imitation of nature by means of computer code.\n\nThe challenge for this piece was to capture some of the looseness and fluidity of the human hand when holding a brush or a pencil, and reproducing some typical forms of hand-made scribbles, doodles and brush strokes. However, absent the materiality of paint and canvas, everything is simulated here on the base of a very simple resource: circles. Everything you see is built of very many overlapping circles of varying sizes, colors and opacities. It is circles all the way down…\n\nInspiration for this work comes from a number of expressionist painters, from 20th century classics like Cy Twombly, to the magnificent contemporary work of Philip Maltman: https://www.instagram.com/philipmaltman/\n\nThis work is animated.\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 1000 x 1000 resolution. Please note that rendering at high resolutions can be slow.\n\nMade with the open-source libraries p5.js and chroma.js\n",

            "description": "\"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a magical kingdom known for its beautiful landscapes and mystical creatures. The kingdom was ruled by a kind and fair queen, who loved nothing more than to spend her days exploring the vast and varied terrain of her realm.\n\nOne day, the queen was wandering through a particularly cold and snowy region of the kingdom when she came upon a strange sight. Instead of snow, the ground was covered with soft, fluffy balls of wool, as if the earth itself had been transformed into a giant ball of yarn.\n\nThe queen was fascinated by this curious phenomenon, and she decided to follow the trail of wool to see where it led. After walking for some time, she came upon a beautiful lake, the surface of which was frozen solid. But instead of ice, the lake was made entirely of woolen fibers, swirling and twirling in the gentle breeze.\n\nThe queen marveled at the sight, and she couldn't help but reach out and touch the soft, velvety surface of the woolen lake. As she did, she felt a warmth and comfort wash over her, as if the wool were alive and pulsing with energy.\n\nOver the years, the queen visited the woolen lake often, always feeling a sense of peace and contentment when she was near it. And as the years went by, the people of the kingdom began to flock to the woolen lake, seeking the same sense of warmth and comfort that the queen had found.\n\nThe woolen lake became a beloved and sacred place in the kingdom, and it was known throughout the land as the \"mar de lã\" - the sea of wool. And so it remained, a magical and mystical place that brought joy and happiness to all who visited.\"\n_AI GPT\n\nMade with <3 and p5.js",

Eliot, Four Quartets: Burnt Norton (1936)\n\nThis work is an attempt to encapsulate in an algorithm, not the likeness of a flower, but the likeness of a painting of a flower. If, according to a very old definition, art is an imitation of nature, this is an imitation of an imitation – a sort of meta-imitation of nature by means of computer code.\n\nThe challenge for this piece was to capture some of the looseness and fluidity of the human hand when holding a brush or a pencil, and reproducing some typical forms of hand-made scribbles, doodles and brush strokes. However, absent the materiality of paint and canvas, everything is simulated here on the base of a very simple resource: circles. Everything you see is built of very many overlapping circles of varying sizes, colors and opacities. It is circles all the way down…\n\nInspiration for this work comes from a number of expressionist painters, from 20th century classics like Cy Twombly, to the magnificent contemporary work of Philip Maltman: https://www.instagram.com/philipmaltman/\n\nThis work is animated.\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 1000 x 1000 resolution.

Considered by many the first female photographer, Atkins learned about the cyanotype process soon after it was invented by John Herschel, a family friend. As a botanist, she had the idea of using the new technique to produce contact prints of plants. Her investigations succeeded in capturing the nuances in morphology and the delicate details of many species.\n\nIn 1843 she published “British Algae: Cyanotype impressions”, the first published book to use a photographic process for the illustrations. Each copy gathered around 400 prints, each of them individually produced from a different specimen. Thus, all books featured the same species, but each of them was different, in a process that was itself generative in a certain way. Today, about 17 copies of the book are preserved in different institutions. Atkins went on to publish two more books in the following years, with the help of her friend Anne Dixon, dedicated to various ferns and plants.\n\n“Cyanotypes” pays homage to her wonderful work, which sits at the intersection between science and art, and used technology in a novel way to capture the beauty of nature. Here things are taken one step forward, to generate algorithmic simulations of plants, ferns, and algae, which are the work of fantasy and not necessarily faithful to the traits of any real species.\n\nThe work features 28 basic configurations, each of them in turn capable of unlimited variations. As was the case with the prints from “British Algae”, every image is at the same time part of a series and unique. \n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 800 x 1000 resolution.

Eliot, Four Quartets: Burnt Norton (1936)\n\nThis work is an attempt to encapsulate in an algorithm, not the likeness of a flower, but the likeness of a painting of a flower. If, according to a very old definition, art is an imitation of nature, this is an imitation of an imitation – a sort of meta-imitation of nature by means of computer code.\n\nThe challenge for this piece was to capture some of the looseness and fluidity of the human hand when holding a brush or a pencil, and reproducing some typical forms of hand-made scribbles, doodles and brush strokes. However, absent the materiality of paint and canvas, everything is simulated here on the base of a very simple resource: circles. Everything you see is built of very many overlapping circles of varying sizes, colors and opacities. It is circles all the way down…\n\nInspiration for this work comes from a number of expressionist painters, from 20th century classics like Cy Twombly, to the magnificent contemporary work of Philip Maltman: https://www.instagram.com/philipmaltman/\n\nThis work is animated.\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 1000 x 1000 resolution.

            "description": "This is an algorithmic tribute to the pioneering work of Anna Atkins (1799-1871). Considered by many the first female photographer, Atkins learned about the cyanotype process soon after it was invented by John Herschel, a family friend. As a botanist, she had the idea of using the new technique to produce contact prints of plants. Her investigations succeeded in capturing the nuances in morphology and the delicate details of many species.\n\nIn 1843 she published “British Algae: Cyanotype impressions”, the first published book to use a photographic process for the illustrations. Each copy gathered around 400 prints, each of them individually produced from a different specimen. Thus, all books featured the same species, but each of them was different, in a process that was itself generative in a certain way. Today, about 17 copies of the book are preserved in different institutions. Atkins went on to publish two more books in the following years, with the help of her friend Anne Dixon, dedicated to various ferns and plants.\n\n“Cyanotypes” pays homage to her wonderful work, which sits at the intersection between science and art, and used technology in a novel way to capture the beauty of nature. Here things are taken one step forward, to generate algorithmic simulations of plants, ferns, and algae, which are the work of fantasy and not necessarily faithful to the traits of any real species.\n\nThe work features 28 basic configurations, each of them in turn capable of unlimited variations.
