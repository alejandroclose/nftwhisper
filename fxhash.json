So, I named the algorithm 'Kralen', which means 'beads' in Dutch.\n\nThe algorithm 'Kralen' creates random bezier curves using the edges of a rectangular boundary, and places beads atop these curves to create a 'bead maze' effect. The algorithm offers different curve creation modes, with the most common mode being 'Mix'. In this mode, two random edges of the boundary are chosen to form bezier curves. Other modes create curves that are horizontally or vertically oriented, or formed using only the corners of the boundary\n\n---\n\nThe work is created with p5.js with the help of bezier.js for working with bezier curves.",

But as I returned, the foundations of what I once called home began to shake. Places and people I had known for so long now seemed foreign, leaving me with a sense of longing and emotional distress.\n\nThis realization marked a significant turning point in this piece and it took on a chaotic demeanor, with everything disintegrating and falling apart. While grappling with this newfound sense of dislocation, I found myself struggling to make sense of the world around me, searching for meaning and purpose in a place that had become unrecognizable.\n\n“asunder” documents my journey from a state of ease and belonging to one of mental turmoil, lamenting the fleeting moments that slipped away while also conveying optimism for a more promising future.\n\n/////\n\nPress “1”:\t5K px (with texture)\nPress “2”: \t7.5K px (with texture)\nPress “3”: \t10K px (without texture)\nPress “4”: \t12.5K px (without texture)\nPress “5”: \t15K px (without texture)\nPress “6”: \t17.5K px (without texture)\n-> These will automatically export a png + jpg after the simulation is done.\n\n“p” to export a png.\n“j” to export a jpg.\n\nOn mobile: Tap and hold canvas for 2 sec. to export a png with 2.5K px.\n\n“f” to enter fullscreen mode.\n“h” to render a hi res version in full screen mode.\n\nMake sure your browser's zoom level is set to 100% (or play around with different zoom levels :)\nNote that in the fullscreen mode, the overall composition adapts to the screen size in order to maintain a visual appeal across all aspect ratios.

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "As I first embarked on this project during my time abroad, my focus was on isometric projection, using the precise depiction of cubes to reflect the order and tranquility I found there. But as I returned, the foundations of what I once called home began to shake. Places and people I had known for so long now seemed foreign, leaving me with a sense of longing and emotional distress.\n\nThis realization marked a significant turning point in this piece and it took on a chaotic demeanor, with everything disintegrating and falling apart. While grappling with this newfound sense of dislocation, I found myself struggling to make sense of the world around me, searching for meaning and purpose in a place that had become unrecognizable.\n\n“asunder” documents my journey from a state of ease and belonging to one of mental turmoil, lamenting the fleeting moments that slipped away while also conveying optimism for a more promising future.\n\n/////\n\nPress “1”:\t5K px (with texture)\nPress “2”: \t7.5K px (with texture)\nPress “3”: \t10K px (without texture)\nPress “4”: \t12.5K px (without texture)\nPress “5”: \t15K px (without texture)\nPress “6”: \t17.5K px (without texture)\n-> These will automatically export a png + jpg after the simulation is done.\n\n“p” to export a png.\n“j” to export a jpg.\n\nOn mobile: Tap and hold canvas for 2 sec. to export a png with 2.5K px.\n\n“f” to enter fullscreen mode.\n“h” to render a hi res version in full screen mode.\n\nMake sure your browser's zoom level is set to 100% (or play around with different zoom levels :)\nNote that in the fullscreen mode, the overall composition adapts to the screen size in order to maintain a visual appeal across all aspect ratios.
