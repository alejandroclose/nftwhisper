Inspired by childhood memories that passed through the watercolor sketches of my mother, who was an artist, the piece reflects my admiration for her work and her influence on my own artistic endeavors. \nIntricate forms contrast with the strict forms of cells. All these are echoes from childhood - watercolor lines of a child not bothered by a special artistic idea but trying at least to a fraction of mastering the fine arts and cubes reminiscent of ones which children use to build towers.\nOverall, the piece is a tribute to the joy and creativity of childhood, and to the power of artistic inspiration that can be passed down from one generation to the next.\n\nMade with p5js and a few GLSL shaders.

Are we a mere accident, created by the forces of nature, or are we hand-crafted by god himself? If we are a coincidence, the chances of humanity happening are absurdly minuscule. If we were hand-crafted by God, then how could it be possible that God is eternal, yet he was incarnated as the finite, human Jesus? That doesn’t make sense.\n\nWhy are we here? Well… We don’t know. And if you think about it, why should we? And why do we even need a purpose? Isn’t just existing enough to satisfy us? Humanity’s search for a meaning is plainly absurd, because it is simply undiscoverable. \nSisyphus can be considered the embodiment of the human struggle against the absurd. He is condemned to push a boulder up a hill every day, for eternity. He, and us, must struggle with the meaninglessness of our existance, without any real hope of succeeding.\n\nBut what if we don’t consider purposeness as something negative? What if we just enjoy our lives, with the full knowledge that they have no meaning whatsoever?\n\n“One must imagine Sisyphus happy” - Albert Camus.\n\n\n\nSketch written in pure JS.",

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px). It may last for high numbers.\nWe recommend the use of Chrome browser in order to render properly the texture.\n\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 × 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.net",

I struggle to be present in the moment because of anxieties related to the past or the future.\n\n\"On Time\" explores the elusive nature of time and my relationship with it. Through this project, I aimed to create an experience that captures the way that we each experience time in our own way. Seeing that time is not linear but instead, it ebbs and flows in different ways.\n\nAt the heart of the experience is a visual reminder to stay in the moment and embrace it. The project consists of 256 unique visuals, each one representing a fleeting moment that has been captured in digital form. These moments are presented in a way that allows you to observe them, appreciate them, and stay present in them. \"On Time\" is an invitation to pause, take a deep breath, and remind ourselves that we are always where we need to be.\n\nControls\n[ f ] - fullscreen\n[ s ] - save the current frame as an image\n\nCreated with Three.js\nCopyright (c) Dec. 2022 - Feb. 2023 Shaderism",

            "description": "Direction determination refers to the ways in which a cardinal direction can be determined in navigation and wayfinding. The most direct method is using a compass, but indirect methods exist, based on the sun, the moon, the stars. It helped humans to explore the world as we know it.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'Cardinal directions' is inspired by minimalism and express natural human predisposition to explore the world. Our curiosity led as to where we are now. We explored the nature that surrounds us and were able to adapt to various circumstances. We overcome difficulties and used it to our favor.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe collection consists of 4 different geographical areas - mountains, woods, seas and plains. Each area has its own unique element - a monument created by humans as a symbol of how we adapt in different places.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeographical areas: Mountains, Woods, Seas, Plains;\nMonuments: Castles, Watch Towers, Lighthouses, Windmills;\nDaytime: Day, Night;\nMoon phase: Full, Waxing, Waning;\nWeather: Dusky, Cloudy, Clear;\nSky objects: Stars, Shooting Star, Birds;\nLegendary creature: Sea Snake (Rare).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResolution: 2000x2000 px\nPress [s] to download the piece as a png file\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Feb 2023\nArtist: Jidoari",

            "description": "As a lifelong enthusiast of all things furry, I am continually captivated by the soft and luxurious feel of fur and the many forms it takes in the natural world. From wild animals velvety coats to the comfort of plush blankets and pillows, fur has a special quality that evokes warm and cozy feelings.\n\nFor many people, the touch of soft fur on their skin brings back memories of the safety and security of home. This sense of comfort can be especially powerful, providing a refuge from the turmoil and unpredictability of the outside world.\n\nWhether it is the shimmering pile of a top-quality carpet, the fluffiness of a cherished pet, or the stiff and rough fur of a bristly shepherd dog, the texture and appearance of fur is truly mesmerizing. It is not surprising that it has been a subject of human fascination throughout history and continues to be so even today.\n\nWith this project, I attempted to embody that cozy feeling by experimenting with various shapes and techniques while still maintaining a furry appearance.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\n\nThe generation of a hi-res image, up to 8.000x8.000 pixels, takes some time and you can see the drawing process happening in real-time.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters and pressing the following keys the artwork will regenerate at a different scale:\n\n- 1 -> 2.160x2.160\n- 2 -> 4.000x4.000\n- 3 -> 6.000x6.000\n- 4 -> 8.000x8.000\n\n=============> PROFILES <==============\n\nThere are 15 distinct profiles, each with varying levels of rarity:\n\nShattered -----> 18%\nInvalidated ---> 10%\nIntersect -----> 9%\nStrippy -------> 7.5%\nSweater -------> 6.5%\nSmally --------> 6.5%\nKasparov ------> 6.5%\nTriangle ------> 6%\nShell ---------> 6%\nMononoke ------> 6%\nSpiral --------> 4.5%\nSplatter ------> 4.5%\nSquiggle ------> 4%\nMcFly ---------> 3%\nKocinski ------> 2%\n\nThe \"Invalidated\" profile features a unique mode that can occur with a 7.7% chance, which includes blood marks as a tribute to a personal story that frequently came to mind during the development of this project.\n\nAs a child, I once snuck into the kitchen with the intention of stealing some Torrone while my mother was sleeping on the couch in the living room. I used a chair to reach the cupboard and was able to successfully obtain the sweet grail. I then grabbed a large knife to cut it, but while I was putting all my effort into cutting the hard candy, I failed to remove my left hand from under it. As a result, the blade sliced through the tip of my middle finger, causing me to start bleeding profusely. I ran to my mother, crying for help. When she woke up and saw me, she scolded me, saying: \"Move away from the carpet! You're ruining it with all that blood!\"\n\nI still bear a distinct line-shaped scar on my fingerprint today.\n\n=============> MAMIE <==============\n\nThis project is a tribute to my beloved grandmother Lucille, who recently passed away. Regrettably, I was unable to attend her funeral and I wanted to express my reverence for her wonderful spirit in this way. Her home in Blanquefort was abundant with soft and plushy surfaces, ranging from moquettes and carpets to stuffed toys and velvety cushions. As a child, it felt like the coziest place on earth.\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\n\nPowered by p5 and chroma.",

            "description": "Description of Seasons of Siskiyou Series\n\nSurrounding my home, covering more than one million acres, is the Rogue River - Siskiyou National Forest which takes up three southern Oregon counties and one northern California county.  It’s a magical place that fills the imagination and lifts the spirit; a place that inspires with its uniqueness, its legends, and its larger-than-life vistas.\n\nEach season in the Siskiyous is a unique experience unto itself.  So, with an attention to the feelings this place evokes at any given time of the year, I designed four generative tokens to create an impression of the emotion–the calming quietness; the peaceful solitude; the overwhelming contrasts and variety of forms, shapes and textures; the magic and playful mystery; the welcomingness and foreboding.  These four works feature clever and inventive creative coding techniques in a rich, graphic style to craft a stunning impression of the Seasons of Siskiyou.\n\n\nToken 4 of 4 - The Weight of Winter (1990 x 1080) p5js Generative Token.\n\nAll good things must come to an end.  After a glorious time of renewal and rebirth, the months of growth and bounty come to a close.  A time of reflection and rest approaches.  All that can be done has been done; and, all one can do is endure the season of slumber.\n\nAs light fades with the shyness of the sun, the need to sleep takes over as the creatures of the wilderness test their preparedness.  Travelers to warner lands have offered farewell to those brave enough to stand against the coming snows.  Those who have remained will carry the weight of winter.  The festival of fall had provided so much to carry them through to the colors of spring.  Has it been enough?\n\nThe weight of winter can be crushing; but, it’s the pressure that shapes the designs of persistence, endurance and perseverance required to fight against it.  With its paler of indifference, the monochrome landscape of winter hides the brilliance of those schemes aimed at mastering the challenges of survival.  With their perfect adaptations, nature survives to take on winter’s heft with defiant joyfulness and triumphant serenity.  \n\nThe Weight of Winter features a generative atmosphere with distant mountains; flow-field conifer trees on noise-wave foothills; a random cluster of subject conifers in the mid-space; and a flow-field tree branch with an interpolated dusting of snow.  Diamond dust – small spears of ice – are simulated with an optical-effect along with random snowflakes.  A generative ‘conspiracy’ of ravens are scattered along the tree tops.\n\nOnce the scene is completely generated, a framing box will appear.  Press the DOWN ARROW to save the scene as a png image file.  Click or tap the canvas to toggle full screen mode.\n\nToken Published May 9, 2022 on FXHASH set at 75 Editions.\nWritten and designed by Ed Cavett using the p5js library.\nToken 4 of 4 from the series “The Seasons of Siskiyou.”",
