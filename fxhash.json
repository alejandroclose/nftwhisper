            "description": "A poignant tribute to the tumultuous inner landscapes of individuals who resist the embrace of introspection and contemplation. This intricate piece portrays a fusion of elements that vividly capture the essence of chaotic minds caught in perpetual distraction.\n\nA mosaic of decay and disorder. A canvas resembling a weathered metal plate forms the foundation of the piece. The plate is marked by the passage of time, bearing intricate patterns of scratches that weave across the surface like tangled thoughts. The rusted scratches crisscross haphazardly, symbolizing the disarray of neglected contemplation.\n\nSuperimposed upon this corroded backdrop are bold strokes of jet-black ink. These strokes seem to have been applied with both intention and spontaneity, resembling calligraphy written in the language of frenzied thoughts. The strokes intermingle with the rust scratches, occasionally converging into enigmatic shapes or dispersing chaotically. \n\nThe texture, an intricate network of independent cells, creates a three-dimensional illusion. These cells evoke the impression of neural networks, as if the very fabric of the artwork is composed of fragmented neurons that are struggling to communicate.\n\n\"Disconnected Neurons\" intends to speak to the unexplored depths of the human mind. It implores those who encounter it to pause, to reflect, and to acknowledge that within the chaos, there exists an opportunity for transformation‚Äîa chance to bridge the disconnected and give rise to profound insights, creativity, and personal growth.\n\n-\tHit s for svg export\n-\tHit p for png export (could take a little longer)\n\nParams for palette, form factor, mode and composition seed ",

            "description": "Richter is the second collaboration of Richard Nadler and Leander Herzog, following their first project called Gerhard. A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time.\n \nRichter works with data from 4 of 24 highres images, 30mb in total. This is the maximum size fxhash allows for a project and three times more than Gerhard. Richard Nadler created stunning new textures, enabling more variation in composition and detail to emerge at much higher resolution. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Richter elevates the approach from Gerhard with new methods for the realtime rendering process and new features like offline-first caching. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels as data.\n \nRichter is featured in the exhibition \"Generative Abstraction\" at Expanded.art in Berlin.\n \n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color.\n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen.\n- Press ‚Äús‚Äù to save the canvas.\n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nleanderherzog.ch/2023/richter/\nleanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/\nfxhash.xyz/generative/17030/",

            "description": "The algorithm to determine the shortest path between a set of points is a famous computer science problem, notoriously difficult, and known as the \"Traveling Salesman Problem\".\n\nThis piece is another entry in my study journal of algorithmic emergent systems, and is based on this famous problem. \n\nThis time, I used the following description:\n- Place N points randomly on the canvas, and assign a random direction to each point. \n- At each step, draw the shortest line that connects all the points, and move each point along its defined direction\n\nAs usual, each step is typically drawn with very low opacity, and is repeated hundreds of thousands of times. Eventually, the interaction between overlapping lines creates unexpected patterns and textures.\n\nThe recent introduction of the new fxparams system was a great opportunity to expose the inner workings of the algorithm and let collectors actively contribute to the final outputs. In my previous long form projects, parameters ranges were carefully limited to make sure all outputs were consistent. Here, exploration of extreme ranges is voluntarily left open, allowing collectors to come up with their own variations.\n\nWith this system, the collector becomes a critical part of the art creation process. In order to acknowledge that, 75% of the royalties will go to the minter.\n\nTo go with the spirit of this token, the total number of editions will also be an emergent property of the market: starting with a large supply of 10.000 editions, half the supply will be burned every Tuesday at noon EST, and the mint price will be increased by 1 tz.\n\nThis token uses the regl.js library. Higher resolution outputs can be generated by adding ?s=2 or ?s=3 to the live view URL. The 's' key will save the output as png.",

This grid can be used as a basis for stacking a more or less large set of tetragons, and they combine with each other to form polygons, enhanced by a minimalist palette of colors, inspired by the work of Mondrian. The key to this orderly world is the use of the right angle.\n\nThus, everything has its place, and a place exists for everything.\n\n---\n\nYou can download various versions of this artwork :\n\n- press \"p\" to download a PNG at the current resolution of your browser\n- press \"h\" to download a high-resolution PNG (8K) suitable for print\n- press \"s\" to download an SVG version that you can then use to generate any image size\n\n---\n\nCoded with care, and with the help of p5.js, p5.js-svg and polybooljs libraries.\nConsider any bug that you could get in your edition as a blessing from the RNG Gods !",
