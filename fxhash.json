The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years.

            "description": "\"Three dead trees on earth\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at PARIS+ par Art Basel.\nThis cycle is totally linked to my activity as a scientific researcher. Trees are data structures very much used in computer science and I worked on the random generation of these structures. It seemed interesting to me to make a link between the digital world (and these trees) and nature in danger. The 3 dead trees refer to the old beliefs of the south of France, while questioning us on the mutations of the world, and the risk to neglect our planet. Are the trees of the computer science the dead trees of our forests? To complete my work, I added a red sun, which is in fact a zonotopal subdivision (a complex mathematical object), that is to say a kind of tiling with rhombuses. I wanted to give a Japanese touch to my work, I love the minimalist poetry of Japanese gardens where everything is in its place and in harmony.

            "description": "This generator is named 'Ichigo' (Ëã∫/ „ÅÑ„Å°„Åî), the Japanese word for 'strawberry'. \n\nSeeing each iteration from a suitable distance, small dots (to me, reminiscent of strawberry seeds) overlay different sequences of geometric repetitions, implying a sense of texture, grittiness and irregularity. \n\nBy looking closer however, it becomes apparent to the viewer that the majority of the composition is in fact government by orderly elements, in this case grids of dots. \n\nThis discovery invites the viewer to consider the output in front of them at different levels, near and far. At what point do you feel the dots begin to dissolve into a texture? When do you stop noticing the dots and instead begin to perceive the overall composition?\n\nThese questions are posed in a similar fashion as with meditation; at what point does something become something else? When does an in-breath become an out-breath and vice versa? \n\nContemplation on simple questions like these can open a small portal into stillness and mindfulness by taking time to slowly observe our responses. \n\n23 palettes are included, each named after different areas of Tokyo. \n\nPress 'S' to download a full size 6000px x 6000px PNG output. \n\nAs always, much gratitude and enjoy your piece.

            "description": "‚ÄúFelix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas‚Äù\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state ‚Äì heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil‚Äôs quote from the beginning translates to: ‚ÄúFortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things‚Äù. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP üññ\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 ‚Äì 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz‚Äôs ‚Äúadrift‚Äù, lunarean's ‚ÄúHeat Death‚Äù, and Monotau‚Äôs ‚ÄúCradle‚Äù collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

            "description": "\"Textura\"\n\nMy initial goal was to create artwork that could trigger raw, visceral emotions and feelings. A polar opposite to the polite, clinical precision of some other collections, I wanted to embrace the grittier side of abstract art. \n\nThis turned out to be a rather difficult project for me. It was a departure from my usual figurative / ink line style, where most of the time I find it straightforward to tell a \"good\" output from a \"bad\" one. Here, out of my comfort zone, I couldn't tell. I liked some outputs, I hated some. The ones I hated, usually would be someone else's favorites. Abstract art is hard !\n\nAfter a while, some patterns started to emerge. The overall feedback was that, generally:\n- blue outputs were peaceful\n- orange ones were intense and aggressive\n- black and white ones were oppressive and sometimes disturbing\n\nIf you can associate an emotion to any given output, I feel like I will have achieved my goal. Thank you to everyone who provided feedback !\n\n \nTechnically, this project also posed a number of challenges:\n- how to blend a large number of procedural textures in a smooth, yet natural way\n- how to make sure the final piece has some kind of depth, visible beyond the intricate layering\n- how to optimize contrast and get vibrant results\n\nThis was mostly achieved by spending a lot of time designing and fine-tuning color schemes - enhanced versions of color palettes, that also contain pre and post-processing settings.\n\nThe collection features a total of 31 color schemes. \n\nKey commands:\n'1', '2', '4': increase resolution\n's': save png\n'n': toggle background noise\n'c': toggle background canvas texture\n\nOn mobile devices, the rendering resolution is reduced to deal with memory limitations.\n",

            "description": "‚ÄúFelix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas‚Äù\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state ‚Äì heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil‚Äôs quote from the beginning translates to: ‚ÄúFortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things‚Äù. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP üññ\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 ‚Äì 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz‚Äôs ‚Äúadrift‚Äù, lunarean's ‚ÄúHeat Death‚Äù, and Monotau‚Äôs ‚ÄúCradle‚Äù collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

Collectors should still look closely and choose what they like when buying on secondary.\n\nWhich team are you on? X or O?\n\nfollow culla on twitter for updates. Or maybe __acolyte__\n\nIf the non reserved tokens mint out quickly, Access List mints will have 24 hours to mint reserves assigned to those wallets\n\nThank you for supporting an emerging artist in the generative art space\n\nAccess List reserves were given to holders of the following PFP collections created by culla\n2x for each Basqunk held\n1x for each Inkspunk, TwoFourQunk, V0iD, DeeManz, Punkasso and CR0$$KULL\nYou would have needed to transfer the above tokens to your mint wallet at the time of the snapshot\n\nshare your tokens on social media with #genxyznft\nMade with love by culla using p5.js",

            "description": "‚ÄúFelix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas‚Äù\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state ‚Äì heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil‚Äôs quote from the beginning translates to: ‚ÄúFortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things‚Äù. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP üññ\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 ‚Äì 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz‚Äôs ‚Äúadrift‚Äù, lunarean's ‚ÄúHeat Death‚Äù, and Monotau‚Äôs ‚ÄúCradle‚Äù collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.
