            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. \nwww.tribute-hwf.com\n\n‚ÄúOne criterion for art involves the process used by the artist for shaping the work. In the special case of mathematically supported fine art, the artmaking process occurs in a mathematically defined operation that allows the generation and transformation of images, methods used for picture processing.‚Äù - Herbert W. Franke\n\nI first came across Franke‚Äôs ‚ÄòOrnamental Alphabets‚Äô in his book ùòäùò∞ùòÆùò±ùò∂ùòµùò¶ùò≥ ùòéùò≥ùò¢ùò±ùò©ùò™ùò§ùò¥ - ùòäùò∞ùòÆùò±ùò∂ùòµùò¶ùò≥ ùòàùò≥ùòµ, and was intrigued with the idea of using a simple letterform to explore different generative image processing techniques. \n\nI‚Äôve used letters and writing in my work for a long time, both with letterpress printing and in my asemic poetry programs. With asemic writing, I generate unrecognizable letters to reference text, and here I use recognizable letterforms removed from their typical function as language signifiers. \n\nMy goal with this project was to build as much texture and layering as possible by warping and collaging the letters together in various ways. The font I‚Äôm using is a design I made years ago to supplement my wood type collection for printing. I really enjoyed being able to bring that part of my past work into my generative art practice. \n\nEach image is composed of the letters found in the hash for that piece, divided into either vowels or consonants. The program builds on a technique I‚Äôve used before, where I generate an image to an off-screen canvas and then dive through the pixels to pull out the color and form I want to surface in the final image.\n\n25% of the primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke. These funds will be used by ZKM Karlsruhe to digitize Franke‚Äôs 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any additional funds raised will be donated to the R√ºtgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n- Press ‚ÄúR‚Äù to increase the pixel density and reload the image (this can be render intensive and will create a really large file suitable for printing)\n- Press ‚ÄúS‚Äù to save a copy\n\nMade with p5js\nArtist: Sarah Ridgley\nOctober, 2022",

            "description": "The story behind this collection is that there isn't really a story behind this collection. It is the result of play, tinkering, and curiosity.\n\nOne of the beautiful things about generative art is how we can achieve drastically different results simply by modifying a few parameters or lines of code. As my first release here on fxhash was 'Sabler', it felt fitting that my release for #fxhashturnsone would itself be a modified version of that 'Sabler' algorithm, albeit giving drastically different results.\n\nIt is notable for the fact that this is perhaps my most 'chaotic' collection yet, letting go of carefully considered proportions, angles and positioning and here leaving that in the hands of the computer. In a way, this simple act represents several design decisions I never would have imagined myself making a year ago, highlighting my growth as a generative artist over the past year.\n\nIt is also a reflection of the inspiration gained from many of the artists and boundary-pushers in the space that each time unlock and encourage creations beyond the immediate comfort zone. For that, this is a 'Thank You' to all of you.\n\nWith that, here's to many more years of generative beauty and inspiration on fxhash and beyond.\n\nAs with previous collections, I highly recommend viewing the images at full size and savouring the details and the chaos up close. Pressing 'S' will save a 6000 x 6000 px PNG file.\n\n50% of primary sales will be donated to the Processing Foundation.",

            "description": "The initial spark for this piece started with Armin Hofmann‚Äôs exercises in style and composition. Just as George Nelson wrote in the preface to Armin‚Äôs book Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practices: \"Despite all our efforts to simplify things - efforts constantly expanding in order to keep abreast of steadily increasing complexity - nothing is very simple anymore\", these explorations just opened doors to other issues, and further grounded the idea that \"if problems can be correctly stated, they can be solved.\"\n\nArmin suggests we go back to the beginning, to concern ourselves with dots and circles and lines and then bring opposed components in confrontation. \"Confrontation is a theme on which variations can be played with any desired consonances, with any imaginable values, and in a great variety of ways. [...] (Only then) (s)he will be able to find creative solutions to the problems presented by the confrontation of opposites.\"\n\nVery quickly opposed components, even with extending the angle of vision from the two-dimensional surface to the three-dimensional space, and with the contrasts of thin-thick, solid-transparent, softened-hardened line, etc., started looking like I‚Äôm weaving complicated plots, visually similar to textile works by  Bauhaus women - Gunta St√∂lzl, Anni Albers, Gertrud Preiswerk and others.\n\nWhen Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919, he proclaimed that ‚Äúevery eligible person whose talent and training are considered adequate will be accepted without regard to age and sex.‚Äù However, in practice, discriminatory gender roles were reinforced, and female students were guided and advised to work with textiles rather than in workshops for heavy crafts such as carpentry. Despite that, Gropius‚Äôs ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs section‚Äù became one of its most collaborative and brave experimental sectors. \n\nA hundred years later, it is disappointing to see we still carry on with inherited gender roles. Check the number of female computer science students in your country. How are things going \"at the intersection of arts and technology\"? I've implemented some of the percentages from Serbia in the distribution of shapes in the final compositions. I sampled the number of female vs. male students at the Faculty of Mathematics and the University of Arts (where I studied and now work), and gender distribution among graduated students, and it didn't look bad at all. But then I realized I'm the only female professor (out of 5) teaching main subjects at doctoral studies program in digital arts.\n\n\"When a group is underrepresented, people come to take that underrepresentation as the norm.\" Since representation is imperative to achieving equality, it is equally critical to change the biases we‚Äôve developed over centuries.\n\nFor the title, I chose a dated version of the word for a female weaver on purpose. My native language is one of the Slavic languages, which are all gender sensitive. It is natural to have feminitives, but since historically some occupations were less (or not at all) practiced by women, many of the feminitives for those professions, jobs, and specializations are rarely used or don't exist in the dictionary. Also, not surprisingly, the dominant version of the noun describing a person who weaves in Serbian would be the female noun \"tkalja\", whereas the male version is so rare that is missing from some dictionaries. Conscientiously choosing the female version of the noun for the title, I position myself and this piece in the historical context with Bauhaus weveresses, contemporary language, and gender contexts, and finally in the curatorial context of the exhibition. \n\nCode Weaveresses is part of the FEMGEN exhibition curated by Micol Ap @verticalcrypoto in partnership with @RtClick_Save and @artblocks_io.\n",

[...] (Only then) (s)he will be able to find creative solutions to the problems presented by the confrontation of opposites.\"\n\nVery quickly opposed components, even with extending the angle of vision from the two-dimensional surface to the three-dimensional space, and with the contrasts of thin-thick, solid-transparent, softened-hardened line, etc., started looking like I‚Äôm weaving complicated plots, visually similar to textile works by  Bauhaus women - Gunta St√∂lzl, Anni Albers, Gertrud Preiswerk and others.\n\nWhen Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919, he proclaimed that ‚Äúevery eligible person whose talent and training are considered adequate will be accepted without regard to age and sex.‚Äù However, in practice, discriminatory gender roles were reinforced, and female students were guided and advised to work with textiles rather than in workshops for heavy crafts such as carpentry. Despite that, Gropius‚Äôs ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs section‚Äù became one of its most collaborative and brave experimental sectors. \n\nA hundred years later, it is disappointing to see we still carry on with inherited gender roles. Check the number of female computer science students in your country. How are things going \"at the intersection of arts and technology\"? I've implemented some of the percentages from Serbia in the distribution of shapes in the final compositions. I sampled the number of female vs. male students at the Faculty of Mathematics and the University of Arts (where I studied and now work), and gender distribution among graduated students, and it didn't look bad at all. But then I realized I'm the only female professor (out of 5) teaching main subjects at doctoral studies program in digital arts.\n\n\"When a group is underrepresented, people come to take that underrepresentation as the norm.\" Since representation is imperative to achieving equality, it is equally critical to change the biases we‚Äôve developed over centuries.\n\nFor the title, I chose a dated version of the word for a female weaver on purpose. My native language is one of the Slavic languages, which are all gender sensitive. It is natural to have feminitives, but since historically some occupations were less (or not at all) practiced by women, many of the feminitives for those professions, jobs, and specializations are rarely used or don't exist in the dictionary. Also, not surprisingly, the dominant version of the noun describing a person who weaves in Serbian would be the female noun \"tkalja\", whereas the male version is so rare that is missing from some dictionaries. Conscientiously choosing the female version of the noun for the title, I position myself and this piece in the historical context with Bauhaus weveresses, contemporary language, and gender contexts, and finally in the curatorial context of the exhibition. \n\nCode Weaveresses is part of the FEMGEN exhibition curated by Micol Ap @verticalcrypoto in partnership with @RtClick_Save and @artblocks_io.\n",

            "description": "The initial spark for this piece started with Armin Hofmann‚Äôs exercises in style and composition. Just as George Nelson wrote in the preface to Armin‚Äôs book Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practices: \"Despite all our efforts to simplify things - efforts constantly expanding in order to keep abreast of steadily increasing complexity - nothing is very simple anymore\", these explorations just opened doors to other issues, and further grounded the idea that \"if problems can be correctly stated, they can be solved.\"\n\nArmin suggests we go back to the beginning, to concern ourselves with dots and circles and lines and then bring opposed components in confrontation. \"Confrontation is a theme on which variations can be played with any desired consonances, with any imaginable values, and in a great variety of ways. [...] (Only then) (s)he will be able to find creative solutions to the problems presented by the confrontation of opposites.\"\n\nVery quickly opposed components, even with extending the angle of vision from the two-dimensional surface to the three-dimensional space, and with the contrasts of thin-thick, solid-transparent, softened-hardened line, etc., started looking like I‚Äôm weaving complicated plots, visually similar to textile works by  Bauhaus women - Gunta St√∂lzl, Anni Albers, Gertrud Preiswerk and others.\n\nWhen Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919, he proclaimed that ‚Äúevery eligible person whose talent and training are considered adequate will be accepted without regard to age and sex.‚Äù However, in practice, discriminatory gender roles were reinforced, and female students were guided and advised to work with textiles rather than in workshops for heavy crafts such as carpentry. Despite that, Gropius‚Äôs ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs section‚Äù became one of its most collaborative and brave experimental sectors. \n\nA hundred years later, it is disappointing to see we still carry on with inherited gender roles. Check the number of female computer science students in your country. How are things going \"at the intersection of arts and technology\"? I've implemented some of the percentages from Serbia in the distribution of shapes in the final compositions. I sampled the number of female vs. male students at the Faculty of Mathematics and the University of Arts (where I studied and now work), and gender distribution among graduated students, and it didn't look bad at all. But then I realized I'm the only female professor (out of 5) teaching main subjects at doctoral studies program in digital arts.\n\n\"When a group is underrepresented, people come to take that underrepresentation as the norm.\" Since representation is imperative to achieving equality, it is equally critical to change the biases we‚Äôve developed over centuries.\n\nFor the title, I chose a dated version of the word for a female weaver on purpose. My native language is one of the Slavic languages, which are all gender sensitive. It is natural to have feminitives, but since historically some occupations were less (or not at all) practiced by women, many of the feminitives for those professions, jobs, and specializations are rarely used or don't exist in the dictionary. Also, not surprisingly, the dominant version of the noun describing a person who weaves in Serbian would be the female noun \"tkalja\", whereas the male version is so rare that is missing from some dictionaries. Conscientiously choosing the female version of the noun for the title, I position myself and this piece in the historical context with Bauhaus weveresses, contemporary language, and gender contexts, and finally in the curatorial context of the exhibition. \n\nCode Weaveresses is part of the FEMGEN exhibition curated by Micol Ap @verticalcrypoto in partnership with @RtClick_Save and @artblocks_io.\n",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press ‚Äúe‚Äù to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press ‚Äúr‚Äù. Which one is the ‚Äúfinished‚Äù artwork? All of them. What is ‚Äúthe‚Äù artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: ‚Äúe‚Äù. To restore: ‚Äúr‚Äù\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing ‚Äúp‚Äù\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing ‚Äús‚Äù (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing ‚Äúd‚Äù followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press ‚Äúd 0‚Äù (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don‚Äôt know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press ‚Äúq‚Äù\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press ‚Äúv‚Äù followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press ‚Äúv‚Äù followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing ‚Äúo‚Äù. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr√≠guez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "The Enfantines¬†are three sets of beginner piano pieces by¬†Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children‚Äôs pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n‚ÄúEnfantines I. Small Talk‚Äù is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. ‚ÄúSmall Talk‚Äù experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n‚ÄúGive them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.‚Äù @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won‚Äôt produce the same outputs, ‚ÄúEnfantines I. Small Talk‚Äù is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie‚Äôs piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI‚Äôve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I‚Äôm done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven‚Äôt been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it‚Äôs crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid‚Äôs drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid‚Äôs mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it‚Äôs only capable of very basic movements. I‚Äôm trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I‚Äôm sure that I can approach the AI‚Äôs conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I‚Äôll need to start from scratch, maybe I‚Äôm crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¬°The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I‚Äôve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with ‚ÄúMenus propos enfantins‚Äù by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add ‚Äú?res=171‚Äù to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add ‚Äú?res=XXX‚Äù to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe ‚ÄúEnfantines‚Äù are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n‚ÄúEnfantines‚Äù are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations‚Äôs background.

Outputs are made up of arrangements of squares in various compositions, yet within that we are free to imagine what they could mean. For some, the resulting shapes might represent DNA strands or atoms. Others might see cells or the building blocks of the hereditary instructions that shape us as individuals. \n\nA generative genetic report accompanies each output to spark the imagination and attempt to attach further meaning to each composition. Some gene sequences carry mutations, however not all mutations are visually apparent. Please refer to the fxhash features to view the reports accordingly.\n\nTexture is used subtly, so for maximum enjoyment it is recommended that you save and view your outputs at full size in order to best enjoy the details.\n\nPress 'S' to save a 2400 x 3396 px PNG file.",

            "description": "Shattered Obelisks began as a work that is dedicated to my habit of mindlessly drawing on paper when I am stressed, depressed or immersed in difficult thoughts.\n\nLike a patient undergoing psychotherapy and piecing together the causes of unconscious fears and anxieties, I and my artwork have assembled ourselves into something shaped, found order in the chaos and separated it from the external noise.\n\nIt took 3 months of continuous, obsessive work. I have developed a huge library, designed for hand-like drawing. The functionality of this library is four times larger than what is shown in this drop.\n\nI plan to put this library out into the public domain when I deem it complete, and hope that it will help someone express themselves through the creative process as much as it helped for me.\n\nIn case you've encountered a problem with inverted colours, try changing browser or disabling extensions. This problem only occurred once during testing on a massive amount of devices and was resolved by disabling extensions.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES BLOCK:\n\nNOTE 1: This artwork should be viewed at a browser scale of 100%. Reducing the scale will increase the amount of detail, but may unpredictably affect the preservation of the location of secondary objects.\n\nNOTE 2: This work can be printed on a plotter. Click S for saving it in .SVG.\nDetailed instructions and answers to possible questions can be found in the console output of the code.\n\nNOTE 3: This drop is the first one from the series of 3. It will be used as AL ticket in next drops of this series.\n\n@abakshonokoleg\n01.08.2022\nTech: P5.JS\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)",

            "description": "Bardez is the Armenian word for garden. It is etymologically tied to an ancient word for paradise, but that link goes deeper than etymology. Gardens have always been small pieces of paradise for me, and hearing the word in Armenian triggers a flood of warm memories.\n\nMemories of wandering around my grandfather‚Äôs garden, plucking ripe plums and figs from their branches.\nMemories of playing in my parents yard, the scent of jasmine in the summer heat.\nOf sun warmed tomatoes in my mom‚Äôs vegetable patch.\nThe smell of dirt and grass.\nMud on my hands.\nSun on my skin.\nMemories of paradise.\n\nI hope you enjoy these gardens I‚Äôve planted, and I hope they remind you of some warm and wonderful memories.\n \nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n - This piece uses a shader to compute the lighting of the terrain in the first frame. If you don‚Äôt have a graphics card, you may have difficulty running this.\n\n - Append ‚Äú&mag=N‚Äù to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you the progress of the render, and also show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.\n\n - Finally, collectors at the highest tier will be entitled to a signed print of their edition. For further details and updates, keep an eye on my Twitter (@_NatSarkissian).\n",

The unnatural drawing order and chromatic differences of the individual faces sometimes yields illusory or paradoxical visual geometries.\n\nPress ‚Äôs‚Äô to save a png.
