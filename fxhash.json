            "description": "Each NFT is a recipe to a physical postcard format (A6 size) and utilizes the Redeemables feature of fxhash, allowing owners to unlock a physical plot directly from the artist @greweb. This figurative artwork is entirely generated through code, employing simple strokes and circular arcs. It may exhibit various inks, papers, and shapes.\n\nTo redeem the NFT, simply send an email directly to greweb@protonmail.com to request a physical plot from @greweb. The NFT serves as the key to obtaining a physically plottable art piece. It exports an SVG file that can be used for plotting with pens. Plotter artists have the freedom to utilize their own materials and ship the completed artwork to collectors, provided they possess the NFT at the time of the request. To obtain the .SVG file, simply drag and drop it into a folder or right-click and save.\n\nFor those interested in the technical details, this work was created using WebGL + Rust + WASM and is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works ‚Äì focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other‚Äôs work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them ‚Äì especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra‚Äôs use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work ‚Äì especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra‚Äôs compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me ‚ÄúMe as you ‚Äù (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor ‚ÄúMe as you as me‚Äù I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach‚Äôs work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, ‚ÄúMe as Me‚Äù has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh ‚Äìis it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave ‚Äì is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  ‚Äì\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes ‚Äì\nPress ‚Äúh‚Äù to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press ‚Äúm‚Äù to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and ‚Äúl‚Äù to reduce it. Use ‚Äús‚Äù to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "This work is composed of a combination of grids with line patterns, like my previous work \"Infinite Animation\" (Project #15745).  However, whereas the previous work was characterized by simplicity and regularity, this one is much more chaotic.\n\nFirst, while in the previous work the grids were fixed at 3 x 3, in this work there are variations from 5 x 5 to 20 x 20. \nAnd in this work, it is YOU who rotates the grid. Clicking on a grid rotates it 90 degrees and changes the image. If you have difficulty locating the grid, press the \"g\" key on the keyboard to display a guide (for touch devices, long press to show/hide the guide).\nIf you get tired of clicking, you can ask your computer to help you. You can toggle the animation mode with the \"a\" key on the keyboard (for touch devices, swipe up to turn on the mode, swipe down to turn it off). In animation mode, the computer rotates a random grid at regular intervals. (The surrounding frame turns green in animation mode.)\n\nThe fun of generative art lies in finding value, or to stretch the point a bit, destiny, in the random coincidences created by computers. Therefore, it is not aesthetically pleasing to artificially modify the derived result later. However, dynamism is also a characteristic of digital art. The fluidity of the results is probably one of its interesting features. I experimented with it in my previous work, \"Abstract Calligraphy\"(Project #15384), and have done it more characteristically in this project.\n\nThis picture is like a puzzle game, but there is no correct answer. No, there may be a correct answer. It depends on your aesthetic sense. Let's enjoy collaborating with the computer!",

            "description": "Obliques are a reinterpretation of Parallels, a collection of AI generated color fields by Marc Maurer. Many of the pieces in that collection are CC0, which basically means they can be reused for other projects, like this one.\n\nObliques takes artifacts from Parallels and uses them as brushes, painting slices of the original image on the canvas in a (hopefully) pleasant, chaotic way.\n\nAbout 10% will be \"Glitched\".\n\nThe \"Source Material\" property will tell you the name of piece that it is using.\n\nYou can see Marc Maurer's Parallels project here:\nhttps://objkt.com/collection/KT1TiSEcASGD19SW8bmqrqgSgCBkwXqDdTJ1\n\nObliques are also CC0, so feel free use anything here in other projects.\n\nYou can read more about CC0 here:\nhttps://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\n\nG : Toggle Grain\nM : Toggle Matte\nS : Save Image\n1 -> 6 : Set pixel density\n(Default pixel density is 1 @ 2000x2000)\n",
