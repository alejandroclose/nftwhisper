            "description": "Inspired by traditional Japanese wagami design. We use the iconic patterns of our previous projects to recreate this artwork. All the patterns are generated first and then used to build the scene. \n\nIn this project Aluan brings his delicate texture from his 'Chaos' series, Jinyao brings his beloved pattern from the 'Cloud' series and Wen brings his iconic pattern from the 'Maze'. 'Collage' is not just about mixing our style, but it is also about finding harmony among all the elements. 'Collage' is also about working together, in that we can create something that's difficult to achieve or imagine if we were working alone.\n\nEach piece contains the patterns of all the 3 artists, each artist has a certain number of patterns with different colors. Depending which artist you get, his pattern will be shown as the primary color theme while the pattern of the other 2 artists turns into grayscale to make the primary pattern with color stand out. \n\nThere are 7 different scenes included in this project, which are : Mountains, Waves, Lake, Hexagons, Tetrapods, Chrysanthemums and Lotus. We took great inspiration from the traditional Japanese design, and we discovered these are some of the most common elements in it. Therefore we decide to use them and reimagine them by mixing our patterns. \n\nThe title 'Collage' doesn't only apply to the visual style, but also to the code as well. In this project we mixed p5.js and Vanilla JS. While Aluan and Jinyao work with their patterns in p5. Wen gathered the patterns and recreated the full scene in Vanilla JS.\n",

I have tried to clean up the code as best as I could, and I hope that there is nothing terribly wrong left inside. \n\nThis will be kind of a charity project where the PRIMARY SALES will be \ndivided as follows:\n - 60 % of primary sales will go to \"Askida Fatura\" -> https://askidafatura.ibb.gov.tr/\n - 20 % will go to Processing Foundation -> https://processingfoundation.org/\n - 20 % will go to Coding Train -> https://twitter.com/thecodingtrain\n\n\"Askida Fatura\" is run by Istanbul Municipality and is a campaign that is used for paying the utility bills of the less fortunate living in Istanbul. On average, a couple of tezos pays one bill, and I hope to pay 5 - 10 bills with this.\n\nI will figure out the best way to transfer the amounts later this week and the upcoming weeks, and will provide proof of transfer via my twitter. \n\nSINCE THIS IS CHARITY, I WILL NOT BE BURNING THE REMAINING EDITIONS!!!\n\nStill, if you dont like what you got ping me and you can get your refund. \n\ntwitter : https://twitter.com/evilnft\nfxhash : https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/evilnft\nobjkt : https://objkt.com/profile/evilnft/created\n\nabout Caterpillars,\n\nThis is a humble project, does not try to achieve too much, and also wants you to not expect too much from it. \n\nfeatures : \n - 8 palettes\n - 2 different origins\n - 5 different characters\n - 6 to 49 sections\n - should be responsive, although I have only tested this on computers...\n\n press \"s\" to save a png.",
