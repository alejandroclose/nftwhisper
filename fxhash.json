            "description": "# Los Osos 2422\n\nI was working on the next EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

By weaving these timelines at different points in time, almost infinite variations can be made. The changing relationship between the two creates dynamic and unique compositions and challenges the visual perception.\n\n## Guide:\n- Please note that the animation responds to window aspect ratio. This is an intentional behavior as part of interactivity. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- To export image at specific size, use URL parameters as below.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.3.1 with Chrome 101.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction:\n- [0] for exhibit. it switches to a different mode every 3 loops.\n- [s] to export PNG image. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause animation\n- [1 ~ 5] for different play modes\n- [1]: all \n- [2]: surficial \n- [3]: constant \n- [4]: all-constant\n- [5]: structural\n- [h] to toggle hi-DPI mode. (for retina display)\n\n## URL Parameters:\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&mode=exhibit&w=800&st=5.3\n- [mode]: play mode (exhibit, all, surficial, constant, all-constant, structural)\n- [w]: width.

Playing with block color and simple motion, each iteration features a rapid animation of basic shapes fluctuating under various different constraints.  The combined character of the full animation appears as an \"angry\" mass with pent up body motion and sharp color contrasting edges.  \n\nOutputs can be programmatically saved to a high quality gif download, which can be used as a unique animated profile picture (*for any service that allows animated gif images)\n\nFeaturing:\nx10 different possible color schemes (4 with near-infinite variations!)\nx4 different possible generative weight classes (each with significant variation)\nx3 different accent coloring styles (two with significant variation)\nx7 different generalized anger levels (affecting animation speeds)\nx6 possible special extra accent detail styles\nx5 different base shape constructions\nx1 'base' generative algorithm *\n\n= 25,200 possible base feature combinations!!  Some traits and combinations are more likely to appear than others...\n\n* Not included in calculations: a near infinite variety of shape positions, sizes, and placements, and a wide spectrum of possible animation lengths!\n\n\n--\n\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress [1] to view at native resolution\nPress [2] to view at high resolution\nPress [0] to scale to default screen width\n\nPress [S] to save a high quality gif!* (May take a couple seconds to render)\n\n*Tested in Google Chrome browser only!  \nShould work in others but please use the latest version of Chrome if encountering any issue.",

            "description": "Waves and Ripples is an implementation of a continuous CA, where wave like behaviours are obtained from the influence of neighbour cells over the cell itself. Depeding on the connections config for each cell, different patterns will emerge, creating waves, ripples, or a mix of both. When single loop is on, the calculations and drawings are done at once, which makes for a more chaotic visual.\nBest enjoyed in full-screen :) \n\nClick anywhere to restart\n\nFeatures : \n  shrinkFactor : 3 types\n  connectArray: 16 possibilities,\n  extraConnection: 4 types,\n  mutualNeighbour: 40% chance,\n  singleLoop: 30% chance\n  monoChromo:  15% chance\n\nInspired by Matt Pearson's book.",
