            "description": "Cellular Automata are one of the oldest and simplest classes of generative systems. Beginning with the highly abstracted, reductionist models of artificial life research by Stanislav Ulam and John von Neumann in the 1940s, Barricelli in the early 1950s, then re-discovered, formalized, expanded and popularized by other mathematicians like Conway and Wolfram 20-30 years later, it's a long-running field of research, rich with unexpected surprises and new discoveries. C-SCAPE is (a partial) result of over 20 years of my own explorations and a celebration of these simple systems.\n\nMost of my purely generative work has been about creating and harnessing emergent complexity & nonrepetitve, ever-changing behaviors (and their interactions) borne from extremely simple systems, mechanisms, algorithms & languages: Exposing, investigating (and yes, celebrating) generativity in its raw form. By minimizing, though not entirely avoiding, additional human aesthetic decision making (here primarily in the form of curating automata rules & color themes), I'm trying to focus the observer on the raw beauty of the underlying processes and bring it to the fore. My hope is, this too will lead viewers asking themselves the deeper questions about the nature of rules, behavior, order and complexity in their own lives, esp. in the current rising polarizing political & anti-science climate. Furthermore, I'd like to provide a counter point and emphasize the unique qualities of generative art, compared to other, more figurative and abstract art approaches.\n\nC-SCAPE simulates a shared toroidal environment in which multiple cellular automata (CA) are evolving and influencing each other, forming short-lived symbioses and/or wiping each other out, only to be restored again later on. The automata are all operating on a single row of pixels at a time and therefore are only 1-dimensional. Yet, many of them also have a short term memory and can produce more complex structures/behaviors by utilizing their memory of previous cell states. Each individually minted version produces a unique system which evolves over time and never repeats.\n\nThe final selection of CA rules used in this piece is the result of many years of experimentation with 100,000s of different configurations and many (manual) review/pruning/cataloging sessions to encourage the minted editions to cover a interesting & balanced subset of the more than duodecillion (10^39) possible individual structures & textures (not including interactions and/or color variations)...\n\nViewing\n\nThe piece in best viewed in medium/high resolution landscape format. The horizontal resolution should be at the very least 800 pixels, preferably double that or higher. There's a max. pixel resolution limit of 4096 pixels in either direction, but CPU performance might suffer at these resolutions.

Now that I’m a part of your tez fam, please open me in live view, enter ‘9’ or ‘10’, wait, press ‘P’, print me, put me on your wall, and enjoy.\n__\n\nClew is a generative art collection designed for your wall.\n\nWhen opening live view, you’ll be prompted to choose a render quality (1 for lowest; 10 for highest). The higher quality renders are for printing and zooming in to choose your own sub-composition or explore the details/depth. Higher quality images will naturally take longer to render but will be worth the wait. If you find a partial render particularly nice, you can press spacebar to pause (and unpause) the render. Save a PNG by pressing ‘P’ or a JPEG with ‘J’. Medium and high quality renders are optimized for Chrome desktop and may not function on other browsers or mobile devices.\n\nThe processing length varies considerably, depending on the assigned traits. Therefore, not all previews will reflect the final output.\n\ncreated using p5js\n\nClew\nabstractment, 2022",

There are 17 figures that get combined and mixed over three layers. The figures vary in complexity but are generally created with vertical and horizontal lines only. Figures have at least one seed, some even have a seed per path. A seed is an oscillating pixel that can be compared to a square wave oscillator of audio synthesis and is usually followed by a path or a set of paths. The purpose of the paths is to send the pixels along the lines to make the figures visible through movement and to create a reduction to pure animation.\n\n👽 Kim Asendorf",

            "description": "fx(mash) is my humble contribution to celebrating #fxhashturnsone\n\nThis series is based on a simple algorithm - lines of a random length are drawn on a square grid until the grid is full.\n\nI have added a variety of features based on some of my favorite fxhash projects and a few special guests.\n\nThis collection is intentionally diverse and disorderly, that's a nice way of saying I only had a short period of time following the release of Acequia. As a result, some of the outputs might be weird, messy, or even bordering on broken (if you get one of the latter please let me know and I'll reimburse you).\n\nDespite being a bit rough around the edges, I hope fx(mash) reflects some measure of my love for the fxhash community. If you're feeling kind, then perhaps it even harks back to the experimental early days :)\n\nThe last year has been an incredible journey, thank you for letting me be a part of our story so far.\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press [s] to save the current image\n- Press [g] to toggle grain\n- Press [h] for a high-res output\n\nBeta Controls (in live view, definitely not fully tested):\n\n- Press [p] to start/pause animation\n- Press [i] to slow down animation\n- Press [o] to speed up animation\n\nAll primary sales go to Savepakistan.\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nfx(mash) uses Gorilla Sun's grain implementation, a big thanks to him and meezwhite for a great article that is well worth supporting https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/all-about-that-grain\n\nThank you to the artists who created the following collections.

            "description": "When the Impressionists first exhibited their work, they derided as lunatics by the art establishment. The vitriol then -- \"wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape\" (referring to Impression: sunrise by Monet) -- reminds me of criticism that generative art, and the NFT world more generally, are subject to now. \"Impossible cathedrals\" is a tribute to rebels who dare to see the world differently. \n\nSince generative art is often criticized as cold and austere, I took this as a challenge to reproduce the spirit of impressionism. Impossible cathedrals -- interwoven arches that cannot exist in reality -- hint at some of the favorite subjects of the impressionists.\n\nThe title alludes to Italo Calvino's novel Invisible Cities, a rebel in another context. Other artists who I had in mind during creation: the Japanese woodblock printing artists Kawase Hasui and Hiroshi Yoshida; American painter JAM Whistler.\n\nImpossible cathedrals was written in p5.js using elements of code by eeedg (thanks)",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

            "description": "fx(mash) is my humble contribution to celebrating #fxhashturnsone\n\nThis series is based on a simple algorithm - lines of a random length are drawn on a square grid until the grid is full.\n\nI have added a variety of features based on some of my favorite fxhash projects and a few special guests.\n\nThis collection is intentionally diverse and disorderly, that's a nice way of saying I only had a short period of time following the release of Acequia. As a result, some of the outputs might be weird, messy, or even bordering on broken (if you get one of the latter please let me know and I'll reimburse you).\n\nDespite being a bit rough around the edges, I hope fx(mash) reflects some measure of my love for the fxhash community. If you're feeling kind, then perhaps it even harks back to the experimental early days :)\n\nThe last year has been an incredible journey, thank you for letting me be a part of our story so far.\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press [s] to save the current image\n- Press [g] to toggle grain\n- Press [h] for a high-res output\n\nBeta Controls (in live view, definitely not fully tested):\n\n- Press [p] to start/pause animation\n- Press [i] to slow down animation\n- Press [o] to speed up animation\n\nAll primary sales go to Savepakistan.\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nfx(mash) uses Gorilla Sun's grain implementation, a big thanks to him and meezwhite for a great article that is well worth supporting https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/all-about-that-grain\n\nThank you to the artists who created the following collections.

Contact me via twitter if you want a super hi-res file. \n\nCopyright pixelwank 2022.\nMade with love and p5js \n\nThanks for collecting!\nBig shoutout to the Circolors fam. Don't worry something's cooking <3 \n\nRemember. It's. For. Fun.\nR.I.F.F. \n<3",

If today, when we have perhaps a thousand different machines, we can distinguish a thousand different noises, \ntomorrow, as new machines multiply, we will be able to distinguish ten, twenty, or thirty thousand different noises, \nnot merely in a simply imitative way, but to combine them according to our imagination.\n- Luigi Russolo (The Art of Noises, 1916)\n\n___\n\nGenerative visual, noise algorithm, organic pattern, inspired by compact disc format, transform in autonomous system, and made with code.\n\n* Interactive feature :\n- Place your mouse cursor to visual screen (canvas)\n- Left click to spin the cd and play audio\n- Right click to reset or back to original\n\n* Every piece in this project have different unique audio.
