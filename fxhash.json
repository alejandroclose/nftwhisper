The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

I have shown this exciting show with squares and circles in a frame, the return of geometric shapes to the empty frame that is their home. It may have vibrant colors and dynamic combinations to evoke a sense of energy and excitement, or it may have cold and calming colors that can include both feelings of happiness and sadness. \n\"Homecoming\" style vary from traditional to contemporary depending on the viewer's point of view and the target audience. It may incorporate elements of realism, impressionism, abstract expressionism, or any other art style that effectively conveys the spirit of \"Homecoming\". It may depict scenes of returning home in the viewer's mind or remind a memory. Some pieces may focus on feelings and memories associated with returning to a particular place or reconnecting with the past or present.\nThe purpose of this work is to celebrate the sense of belonging and pride that comes from returning back to the roots. It serves as a visual representation of cherished memories and shared experiences while evoking anticipation for future encounters.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

I have shown this exciting show with squares and circles in a frame, the return of geometric shapes to the empty frame that is their home. It may have vibrant colors and dynamic combinations to evoke a sense of energy and excitement, or it may have cold and calming colors that can include both feelings of happiness and sadness. \n\"Homecoming\" style vary from traditional to contemporary depending on the viewer's point of view and the target audience. It may incorporate elements of realism, impressionism, abstract expressionism, or any other art style that effectively conveys the spirit of \"Homecoming\". It may depict scenes of returning home in the viewer's mind or remind a memory. Some pieces may focus on feelings and memories associated with returning to a particular place or reconnecting with the past or present.\nThe purpose of this work is to celebrate the sense of belonging and pride that comes from returning back to the roots. It serves as a visual representation of cherished memories and shared experiences while evoking anticipation for future encounters.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

Intrigued by this challenge, I've delved deep into the pixels of this issue. 🙂\n\nDrawing inspiration from Rev Dan Catt’s 'Tally!' and applying similar principles of Cable Management, I've assembled a fun and free OE project.\n\nThis project dynamically evolves with each iteration.Grid is determined by a random value calculated as follows: the lower bound starts at 3 and increases incrementally with every 100 iterations, while the upper bound starts at 4 and increases with every 30 iterations. In practical terms, as the iteration count increases, both the minimum and maximum possible number of cols&rows gradually increase.\n\n3200x3200px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

Intrigued by this challenge, I've delved deep into the pixels of this issue. 🙂\n\nDrawing inspiration from Rev Dan Catt’s 'Tally!' and applying similar principles of Cable Management, I've assembled a fun and free OE project.\n\nThis project dynamically evolves with each iteration.Grid is determined by a random value calculated as follows: the lower bound starts at 3 and increases incrementally with every 100 iterations, while the upper bound starts at 4 and increases with every 30 iterations. In practical terms, as the iteration count increases, both the minimum and maximum possible number of cols&rows gradually increase.\n\n3200x3200px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "Strands of memory are twisted and entangled with each other, blending in and out with the surrounding fog of chaos. Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",
