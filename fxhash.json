            "description": "When you see a piece of generative art, you are looking at a meta-message, an image whose value is not of form but of subtext. These images are a collision and reformation of ideas and conceptual histories between artists Nudoru and Sub Net. This dichotomy reminds us of the painting \"The Treachery of Images\" by René Magritte, where he paints a picture of a pipe but states underneath, \"ceci n'est pas une pipe\" (This is not a pipe), meaning that there is a schism between what a thing is and what it represents. What is unique about these works go beyond the images and text combinations themselves. It is about how images create new thoughts not by not pretending to be completely novel but that builds upon one another in a system of complex synthesis.\n\nThis token is part of the Floor Exhibit co-curated by the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC and Fort Gallery NFT.\n\nViewing in desktop Chrome is recommended for the best results.\nPress' p' to pause/resume.\nPress' s' to save a screenshot.

            "description": "\"I never wanted color to be color. I never wanted texture to be texture, or images to become shapes. I wanted them all to fuse together into a living spirit.\" - Clyfford Still\n\n\nI have spent most of my life residing in urban environments. While figurative art is not a style I typically pursue in my own work, I delight in discovering abstract elements within it. The cities I've inhabited have consistently offered me the chance to do so through their architectural landscapes.\n\nLe Corbusier once said that a metropolis's abstract skyline serves as its autobiography, etched in steel and glass, unveiling its history, character, and ambitions. In this series, my aim has been to encapsulate that sentiment using a minimalistic canvas and a monochromatic palette. Abstract expressionism remains my lens for viewing every artwork. \n\nThe style of this series is my homage to Clyfford Still, an abex artist I have always admired. His ability to convey profound meaning through seemingly empty and unfilled canvases has always intrigued me. \n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress s to save the image in full screen. \n\nPixel Love!",

Psychoanalysis reassorts the maze of stray impulses, and tries to wind them around the spool to which they belong. Or, to change the metaphor, it supplies the thread that leads a man out of the labyrinth of his own unconscious.”\nSigmund Freud\n\nIn this collection, I have deal with labyrinths that have taken place in many independent cultures of the world since mythological times. Labyrinths have always fascinated me. As frightening as they are, the symbol of holiness in the individual's search for ways to move forward is just as iconic. Ever since I discovered the effect of the kufic writing style, which affects my artistic life in creating labyrinths, I have included this in most of my designs. While creating black and white compositions from the bird's-eye map images of the labyrinths, I also aimed to give the feeling of being in the labyrinth with the game mode.\n\n[G] Game and Map mode\n[W] Forward move\n[S] Backward move\n[A] Left move\n[D] Right move\n[Hold Shift] Fast move\n[R] Reset to start point\n[F] Save the current image as .png\n\n----------------------------------------------------\n* 15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.\n\n* According to my period, the owners of “Stratification of the Orthogonal”, “Agora of Timeless” and this project will have free mint rights of the next project.",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens —created in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco— that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking “what if” questions such as “What if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?” Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road —one direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature— it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario’s thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",
