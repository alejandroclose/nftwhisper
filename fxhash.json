For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

            "description": "The third and final installment of the Self trilogy.\n\nEgo is defined as: the one of the three divisions of the psyche in psychoanalytic theory that serves as the organized conscious mediator between the person and reality especially by functioning both in the perception of and adaptation to reality.\n\nPlease see attached fx(text) article or go to https://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy for more on concept/mechanics/etc. It’s a bit of long read, but worth it.\n\nThis is an fx(params) project and you will be able to choose exactly what your iteration will look like. For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

This project, initiated this spring, allowed me to delve into various mechanics and approaches. Today, I am concluding this inaugural study on the cube and publishing it on fxhash, with the aim of sharing it and enabling others to play around with the parameters that make it up.\n\nThanking each individual who has contributed to this project, whether intentionally or otherwise, would be a lengthy task, and I risk forgetting someone. Therefore, a huge thanks goes out to the community here and on OpenProcessing for their ongoing exchange of advice and knowledge.\n\nWhile the code remains riddled with errors, I won't be progressing further with this initial project. This will presumably allow me to avoid overworking on subsequent projects. :-)\n\nmade with p5js, p5.grain and chroma.js\non Openprocessing https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1962145\n",

The less practical and most bizarre, basically the most overcomplicated self-made tool anyone could ever imagine. But it's THE tool to explore ideas.\nI created this one to investigate, to poke and nudge at a few concepts that seem to go hand-in-hand.\nFirstly, Representation, as in changing something to better explain it. Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.\n\nWhile many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.\n\nBut there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.\n\nI can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.\n\nWhat happens when a flower has more petals than pixels? Why do we know there's more layers to that thumbnail?\nMy best answer is:\n\n--Press \"s\" key to save a bigger image (2400x3200 px)\n",

Ant colonies, mushrooms, and trees all follow basic principles, yet their resulting actions and growth patterns are fascinatingly intricate. For example, ants can exhibit intelligent collective behavior, fungi are highly successful organisms that make up a larger biomass than all animals combined, and each tree is unique.\n\nThese emergent properties arise from the environment in which these simple rules operate. A tree's growth is influenced by many factors such as soil, water, seasons, wind, humidity, light, and interactions with other plants and animals.\n\nThis series is a reflection on the beauty and uniqueness of each living thing, and how complexity emerges from simplicity.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, we’ve used a custom variant of the \"reaction-diffusion\" algorithm, which approximates some biological systems. This algorithm was introduced by Alan Turing in 1952 in his paper titled \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis.\" The rules are very simple but by changing the initial conditions and adding perturbations, we can reach very different visual outcomes.\n\nIn this way we create a dialog between the strict mathematical rules interpreted by the machine and the organic visuals that emerge from it.\n\n--------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2560px resolution\nPress 'P' to save the image at 3840px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\n\n--------\n\nWilliam Watkins\nApril 2023",

            "description": "This work represents a study of the cube and its representation that I undertook to understand the workings of p5.js and JavaScript programming. This project, initiated this spring, allowed me to delve into various mechanics and approaches. Today, I am concluding this inaugural study on the cube and publishing it on fxhash, with the aim of sharing it and enabling others to play around with the parameters that make it up.\n\nThanking each individual who has contributed to this project, whether intentionally or otherwise, would be a lengthy task, and I risk forgetting someone. Therefore, a huge thanks goes out to the community here and on OpenProcessing for their ongoing exchange of advice and knowledge.\n\nWhile the code remains riddled with errors, I won't be progressing further with this initial project. This will presumably allow me to avoid overworking on subsequent projects. :-)\n\nmade with p5js, p5.grain and chroma.js\non Openprocessing https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1962145\n",

Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\nAll That Could Be is about the inner life of pitch drops waiting for their inevitable fall.\n\nAfter first learning of the pitch drop experiment and understanding what this odd hyper-viscous liquid was… all I could think about was: How does the pitch feel about all of this? What does it dream of? How does it deal with this intense pressure to snap, drip and perform?\n\nAll That Could Be acts as a metaphysical microscope into the emotional state of the pitch. The anticipated explosion of energy and pain when it loses its battle with gravity… as well as daydreams imagined to brighten its dark, slow existence with vibrant, static-y layers… or fantasies of being anywhere else besides trapped in a funnel under a locked encasement for the entertainment/curiosity of others who just hope to see you snap into two.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://hereandnow.events/\n\nProcure a coin to participate in the event:\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/here-and-now:-edition-5\n\n————\n\nSome key commands in live mode:\n\nG : Toggle grain\nA : Toggle aura\nS : Save current resolution\n1 : 3000x3750\n2 : 4500x5625\n3 : 6000x7500\n4 : 7500x9375\n5 : 9000x11250\n6 : 10500x13125\n(1-6 work best on Chrome/Edge)\n(rendering takes longer as resolution increases)",

It's a search for creating harmonies and disharmonies by combining 3 colors with 3 unsynchronized mathematical equations. Udnē explores the beauty within triadic compositions while attempting to integrate two contrasting textures by forming instances of non-figurative scenes. The collection is a reflection of integrated and contrasting textures in micro and macro scale that we see in our everyday life environment.\n\nYou can press 's' in liveMode to save as 1000x1000px .png.\n\nIn liveMode, add '&density=7’ to the end of the URL to render at high resolution (7000x7000px). You can use 5, 7 or 10 for different resolutions. It will automatically download when the rendering is finished. \n\nSome compositions might take longer to render in low-performance computers. Please be patient and enjoy the process!\n\nAs a rare probability there is an intentionally kept glitch.\n\nMade with p5js.\n@distcollective, November 2022\n",

            "description": "This experimental project involves an on-chain cellular automaton. The features and cellular automaton rules are derived from the minter's address. Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",
