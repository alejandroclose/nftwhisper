            "description": "\"Versus in Motion\" is an animated version, a successor of original \"Versus\" collection\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/21865\n\nIncludes all features of \"Versus\" (resolution levels, switchable orientation, etc) plus it's animated (obviously) and interactive\n- You can stop & start animation at any time by pressing the spacebar\n- You may click (or click & drag) while in animation or not, to modify the current artwork\n\nAnimation cycle is actually a transition between a \"full\" and an \"empty\" state that symbolizes the transition between existence, non-existence,  prosperity & decline and the evolution and progress in general as a result of time passage..\n\nAll are pure code, shapes and curves that processed in a custom fragment glsl (webgl) shader using a relative \"advanced\" developed mixing technique.\n\nCONTROLS\n\nKEYS:\n\n- 1-4: Set resolution from 1x to 4x of the current dimension (possibly slower performance in higher values)\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait with aspect ratio 0.75 (useful eg. for printing)\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape with ratio 4/3  (1.333..)\n- O: Original orientation. That is the default Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ when switching \n  orientations\n\n  For animation:\n- Spacebar: toggle animation (on/off)\n- R: Reset the center of animation (if has been modified with click or drag)\n\nMOUSE:\n\n- Click (or Click & Drag) to set the center of animation\n\n----\nMade with p5js and custom shaders\n\n¬© Dec. 2022  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

            "description": "Cry Diversity is just that - a cry for greater diversity and equality in the genArt community. The UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity beautifully states, ‚ÄúAs a source of exchange, innovation and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature.‚Äù¬† Who better to usher in an age of true appreciation for, and active promotion of cultural diversity than a community of artists and collectors.\n\nExcerpts from the UNESCO declaration are embedded in the piece in the form of asemic writing, infusing the piece with the power of the message as it charms the eye.¬† The collector will also be able to select one of twenty affirmations to be embedded in the work.¬† Each minted edition will stand as a prayer flag waving permanently on the blockchain spreading its message of belief in a world where we are all valued and respected.¬† Cry Diversity will be free to collect, but it comes with a challenge.¬† The collector is expected to actively research the cryptoArt community to find an artist new to them that is a member of an underrepresented group (female, LBGTQIA2+, female identifying, non-binary, POC, global south, etc.).¬† They are then expected to actively promote that artist and their work for at least one week.¬† They are expected to personally raise their voice.¬† Cry Diversity is the second in a series of projects (see the companion piece fx(elevate)) designed to bring attention to individual artists as well as to the value of true commitment to diversity within our community.¬† It will not be the last.\n\nIt is time to make our cries heard and our actions felt!\n\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint a free edition.  Beginning in the 2nd week, the project will be open to the public for an additional week. Un-minted editions will be burned at the expiration of the 2nd week.\n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Choose your Cry.  Lock it.\n4) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \na) Seed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you have recorded the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the seed to retrieve it.\nb) Cry: What do you want our community to symbolize?  Respect, diversity, compassion?  Choose your favorite characteristic.  It will be baked into your output.\n\nProject Details:\nThis work uses the spectral.js library for the development of color palettes. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in June, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download. Press [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for printing.  \n",

            "description": "Cry Diversity is just that - a cry for greater diversity and equality in the genArt community. The UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity beautifully states, ‚ÄúAs a source of exchange, innovation and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature.‚Äù¬† Who better to usher in an age of true appreciation for, and active promotion of cultural diversity than a community of artists and collectors.\n\nExcerpts from the UNESCO declaration are embedded in the piece in the form of asemic writing, infusing the piece with the power of the message as it charms the eye.¬† The collector will also be able to select one of twenty affirmations to be embedded in the work.¬† Each minted edition will stand as a prayer flag waving permanently on the blockchain spreading its message of belief in a world where we are all valued and respected.¬† Cry Diversity will be free to collect, but it comes with a challenge.¬† The collector is expected to actively research the cryptoArt community to find an artist new to them that is a member of an underrepresented group (female, LBGTQIA2+, female identifying, non-binary, POC, global south, etc.).¬† They are then expected to actively promote that artist and their work for at least one week.¬† They are expected to personally raise their voice.¬† Cry Diversity is the second in a series of projects (see the companion piece fx(elevate)) designed to bring attention to individual artists as well as to the value of true commitment to diversity within our community.¬† It will not be the last.\n\nIt is time to make our cries heard and our actions felt!\n\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint a free edition.  Beginning in the 2nd week, the project will be open to the public for an additional week. Un-minted editions will be burned at the expiration of the 2nd week.\n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Choose your Cry.  Lock it.\n4) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \na) Seed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you have recorded the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the seed to retrieve it.\nb) Cry: What do you want our community to symbolize?  Respect, diversity, compassion?  Choose your favorite characteristic.  It will be baked into your output.\n\nProject Details:\nThis work uses the spectral.js library for the development of color palettes. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in June, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.

            "description": "This project uses cellular automata where the state of a cell in a new generation is determined based on its own and its neighbors' states in the previous generation. The guiding rules for these transitions, however, are not static; they undergo a random change every few generations, chosen from a possible 256 rules. By also slightly shifting the positions of cells and using an outline and texture that conveys a hand-drawn style, I have tried introducing an element of organic randomness.\n\nStepping away from the monochromatic color scheme used in my last three series, I have used a gradient effect to convey a transitioning hue across generations, combining a palette of two colors selected from an array of 14 different palettes. \n\nNote on the name: The alternating rules and fluctuating cell positions serve as the apparent justification for its name. However, a subtler inspiration lies in my deep admiration for Franz Kafka and his remarkable short story, \"The Metamorphosis\". Kafka‚Äôs narrative explores the constantly evolving state of human existence, where patterns appear momentarily only to dissipate quickly. Just when you think you've spotted a pattern, poof, it changes. Just like in life, right :)\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.
