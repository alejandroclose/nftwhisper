            "description": "'follow my lead' is a visualization of three communities of individuals, and the ways in which they interact with each other.\n\nUsing an implementation of a physarum slime mold model, I create three distinct groups of homogenous individuals, with each group having different sentiments towards the others. Individuals within a community make their best effort to follow each other around, and depending on group preferences try to either move towards or away from those in other groups.\n\nAll of these interactions take place on a simulated three dimensional landscape (that varies by token), with groups of individuals having a preference towards either moving uphill or downhill.\n\nEach group begins with a different spatial distribution, such that the extent of exposure to others can change over time.\n\nFor more details on the slime mold implementation and a link to the github repo containing the code, see the accompanying fx(text) article.\n\n\nAnimation\n---------\nThis is designed first as a static piece. The final image consists of running 300 steps of the algorithm and then stopping.\n\nHowever, I have also exposed a couple of ways to watch the image evolve over time. It should be noted that for some outputs, the image will eventually degenerate as we go well past the initial 300 frames.\n\nKeys:\n- space: Pauses/unpauses the animation\n- 'F': Fresh start - reloads the page and animates the first 300 frames, pausing when finished (or append &fresh=true to the URL)\n- 'A': Animate - reloads the page and animates in perpetuity (or append &animate=true to the URL)\n\nWebGL\n-----\nThis piece makes heavy use of shaders/WebGL. I've put quite a lot of time/effort into trying to ensure things behave identically across different browsers/hardware. I've managed to get things to the point where I was consistently seeing identical outputs on the set of hardware available to me. However, there is still a risk that on other hardware specs, things will not be identical. Furthermore, it is the nature of this project that even very small differences in calculations can become exaggerated after multiple steps of the algorithm, leading to larger differences in the final result.\n\n\nReferences:\nJeff Jones's Physarum paper: https://uwe-repository.worktribe.com/output/980579\nSage Jensen's post on Physarum, which was my first exposure to it: https://cargocollective.com/sagejenson/physarum\nColor names generated using coloraze: https://github.com/evansque/coloraze",

            "description": "Sol is a companion project that complements my recent series, Metamorphosis. Both projects share a common foundation - a cellular automata engine. The state of each cell in a new generation is influenced by its own state as well as those of its neighboring cells from the last generation. The rules guiding these state transitions, however, are dynamic.\n\nSol for me is an experimental plotter project. As a gesture of my gratitude to minters of Metamorphosis, all minters will be on the reserve list for a free piece of Sol. I’ll take a snapshot of Metamorphosis for the reserve list 30 minutes prior to Sol’s launch. For three days (unless all reserve-holders mint sooner), Sol will be only for those on the reserve list and I'll add anyone who purchases Metamorphosis on primary subsequently. After this period, any remaining pieces, along with an additional 50 mints, will be available for public sale.\n\nA Note on the Name: The inspiration behind the name 'Sol' springs from my visits to SF MoMA, where I always find myself in the space dedicated to Sol LeWitt. Through the repetition and variation of a singular concept, LeWitt constructed forms that were striking, often evolving from basic geometric forms into intricate structures. The same is also echoed in the principle of emergence in cellular automata, where complex systems arise from the interactions of simple components governed by rules. This series, Sol, is a homage to LeWitt's ingenuity in favoring dispassionate geometric forms over the emotionally-infused abstract art styles.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete svg file for plotting. To download three separate svg files with individual colors for plotting press 1,2 & 3. Running an optimization tool can help decrease the plotting time.\n\nPixel Love!\n",

I'll also be using my sampler and synths to create some chiptune tracks.\n\nSo sit back, relax, and enjoy the show!\n-------*--------*--------*-------\nThis is a p5.js computational animation inspired by the work of art-coders' in Processing and shaders. The sound is made up of bleeps and bloops, which are characteristic of chiptune music.
