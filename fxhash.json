            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac.

            "description": "Eye floaters are spots in your vision which often happen as people age. \n\nThis image consists of the interactions of two distinct sets of algorithms.\n\nThe background: Imagine a barbershop floor where one strand of hair has fallen after being cut from every human's head on the planet. If you sorted through those hairs and organized them into groups of color you would find that approximately 2% are red, approximately 5% are blond, approximately 11% are brown or auburn and the rest, approximately 82%, are black or dark brown. \n\nThe background image is made up of randomly placed algorithmically generated spirals or curls, or locks of hair. Random numbers are assigned to variables for number of turns, translation (location) and rotation of each curl. The total number of curls is arbitrary, but the color percentages of curls will stay the same no matter how may curls are drawn.\n\nThe foreground: A single \"tile\" consisting of concentric circles where a smaller inner circle knocks a hole out of the larger outer circle that contains it. A semi-transparent radial gradient of random colors, colors each shape. A regular grid of these tiles are drawn on top of the background. Occasionally one or more tile is allowed to drop out of the grid. The placement of each inner circle in each tile in the array is based on an overlying algorithm. Within the hole opened up by the smaller circle a nearly circular \"pupil\" is placed; it is a single random solid color and it provides a structure to the image. The background shows through the \"iris\" of each eyeball, around the tiles and the edges of the array and where a few tiles have dropped out. \n\nThe juxtaposition of the grid of semi-transparent tiles over the hairy background present a frenetic image. It is visually complex, rich with micro and macro interactions. Enjoy\n\nPlease visit www.drbillkolomyjec.com ",

            "description": "Homage to Johannes Itten a Swiss expressionist painter, designer, teacher, writer, and theorist associated with the Bauhaus. A pioneer of color theory and major influence of Op artists and other expressionist painters in his day.\n\nItten's idea of the color wheel is embodied in the HSL color model where a hue can be located on a circle (red at the 0-degree mark, green at the 120-degree mark, blue at the 240-degree mark and back around to red at 360 degrees or 0). So a hue is a number between 0 and 360), saturation (a number between 0 and 100), and lightness (a number between 0 and 100). In this work a color space is defined by four random HSL colors placed at the corners of the picture frame. Then, given any point in the picture plane, a unique color can be calculated using a bilinear interpolation scheme. This way a unique hue can be determined relative to the corners of the space frame, relative to a set of four random colors. For a little variety I vary saturation for each iteration of an image between 75 and 100. I set lightness at a constant value of 50.\n\nThe tiles are formed by using another idea from the Bauhaus that I call fractions of the whole. I divide the X and Y axes into several non-uniform increments based on a number of random integers and project their spacing into the picture frame to create a tessellation of uniquely shaped tiles. A color calculation is made for each tile is based on the center of the tile in the color space and filled with that color.\n\nExperience images of pure color based on a couple of Bauhaus ideas. Enjoy.\n\nPlease visit http://www.drbillkolomyjec.com",

Every scene opens with a blast. Literary. Elements are created from analog glitched photos and special effects videos finalized as dithered gifs. The background is hand-drawn pixel-art tiles moved and animated by coding. \n\nEach piece is generated within a wide range of predefined rarity features both visual and creative coding.\n\n-> Click on the image to hide and erect the trash.\n\nThe project includes a range of Common, Rare, and Legendary trash attributes like:\n\n- Background Colors \n– Tile Design and Tracery\n– Background Animations\n- Explosions\n- Trash Items\n- Totters\n- Framing\n\nEach feature has weighted rarities and might include variations of none.\n\nAny hints to known personas, events, and nonsense is not a coincidence.\n\n\nProject by INA VARE, 2022.\nCoding: Metimus",

            "description": "Chop Chop is a complementary collection to Caterpillars that I prepared to thank my collectors for the amazing love and interest you showed to my work. I did not want to force my way to your wallets with unsolicited thank-you nfts, so all holders of Caterpillars will have a reserve spot to mint at least 1 tokens per wallet for 0 tez ( I dont understand the reserve options fully, sorry - 128 editions reserved for holders of Caterpillars) . \n\nThe holders of this collection will have reserve spots for my next  collection. The reserve spots will be held for one week from minting, and I prefer the unreserved editions to be fair game for anyone, so first come, first served.\n\nI decided to re-work this older project of mine because it was going to take some time for me to prepare an independent and novel collection and also wanted to continue learning new things. The concept is Paul Klee meets Vector Math and Flow Fields, as you can see the visuals are heavily inspired by Paul Klee's work :)\n\nUnder the hood, the circles and triangles act as repulsive forces that break and distort the grid, and push the squares in their range out of their way, forming some holes in the fabric created by the same algo that made Caterpillars. \n\nI have only added one rarity feature which is the palette because this one uses almost all the palettes from Caterpillars (minus neon dreams). I am hoping that this project will not be about rarity, but more like a thank-you gift and an easy way to access my future work.\n\nWell, I hope you will like it...\n\n- Press \"s\" to save a png.\n\n- Also, 33% royalty split wth the Processing Foundation, % 33 with the minters (if there will be any secondary sales) \n\nDISCLAIMER :\nI am very very new to coding and not very good at this. I have tried to clean up the code as best as I could, and I hope that there is nothing terribly wrong left inside.\n\n\n\n",

It's a defined process of experimentation, and even though I'm the one that wrote the rules, each output breaks through somehow as a complete surprise to me. So when I see them, I get a Chord Unknown.\n\nCreated by Eric Davidson. 2022.",

Looking especially deep into dynamic grids and dynamic frame rates.\n\nAs for the piece itself, it's a reference to how busy this modern world is. How we're all constantly on the go, whether that is physically, or mentally. Almost feeling like a monsoon. A storm of information. A storm of life. A storm of work. A storm of thoughts. A storm of emotions. A storm of everything. And it's all so fast.\n\nAs are the particles. They're all moving around these cyclones of information. Glowing up like neon signs in a busy city. Moving so fast it's almost a blur. Forming into something greater than the sum of its parts.\n",

Inspired by the phenomenon of quantum entanglement, this project aims to connect two, often separate, parts of the generative art community by directly linking them together.\n \nEntangled features two distinct on-chain NFT collections residing on the Ethereum and Tezos blockchains. These collections are connected through shared interactions in real-time, using cross-chain and local storage technologies to enable a system whereby particles in separate browser instances respond to and mirror each other.\n\nThe series consist of a total of 512 unique editions (256 on each blockchain) that are randomly paired with a corresponding iteration on the other. When two or more instances are opened in separate browser windows they will start to interact in different ways depending on whether they are paired or not, or if an entangled pair is owned by the same collector.",

In this scenario, visual complexity is revealed at different times and intensities, offering countless possibilities of perception.\n\nAlong with this, the chromatic variation with unique gradations associated with the play of lights and shadows, gives the project different perspectives and depths, in continuous and complementary cycles of fragmentation and defragmentation.\n\nThus, as in everything that surrounds us, the resulting form does not end in itself, but presents itself as a result of the combination of several other distinct elements.\n\nNothing is just one thing.\n\n#Main Features\n- 13 color schemes “zones”:\n\n* Shadow Sky and Bronze – 12,5% chance\n* TIF, Soldier, Zreen and Ice – 10% chance each\n* Vascai – 7,5% chance\n* Burn Golden, Gray, Lemonade, REC and BR – 5% chance \n* 80’s – 2,5% chance\n\n- 3 canvas formats;\n- 3 frequency;\n- 2 gradient type;\n- 3 degrees of granulometry;\n\n- 1 ultrarare feature | negative effect \n\nThere is only a 1% chance of the negative effect appearing, if you are lucky you will see the following message. \"YOU WIN A FREE EDITION OF MY NEXT PROJECT\"\n\nObs.: \n- The first 5 iterations will entitle you to 1 free edition of my next project on FxHash.\n- The rendering process should take a few seconds, so enjoy the look of the triangles in action.\n\nJuly 30, 2022\n\nGenerative Token by Morbeck for fxhash.",
