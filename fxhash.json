            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

            "description": "Polar Grid is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, London 2022.\n\nThis is a study of color, motion, and composition, and an homage to cinema as an artform. Colorful shapes overlap and pulse in a ever repeating dance. An abstracted movie experience. Each color palette in the series (except one) is inspired by a different film director (if you want a real challenge, see how many you can guess without looking at the feature names).\n\nThe palettes were extracted from movie stills or movie posters and fine tuned by hand. As often, I have to thank independent tool makers for their indirect help. My gratitude goes to David Aerne for FarbVélo and Fabrizio Bianchi for Coolors.\n\nThe code for Polar Grid is based on early iterations of what ultimately became my carat series. Both projects come from the same fascination for color as a system, even though I used a different approach here. You could call this a carat prequel.\n\nThe animation is done using a technique called polar noise. This makes it so the motion of all elements ends up repeating in the same amount of time. This is useful for generating motion that loops perfectly while still appearing organic. In this particular case, the animation repeats every π × 100 seconds.\n\nA challenge in building any generative system is to find the right balance between coherence and variety. I designed the system with the large edition size in mind. During development I generated hundreds of iterations and tweaked my code to make sure that every iteration is truly unique and fits the overall aesthetic of the collection.\n\nI truly hope you will enjoy your own little abstract movie.\n\n— Raphaël de Courville\n\n\nReleased: July 6th 2022\n\nMedium: p5.js, html canvas, css\n\nReference: sk220621\n\n\n**About the artist**\n\nRaphaël de Courville is a generative artist, streamer, and educator.

By dropping the plotter drawing constraint, new perspectives for exploration appeared.\nThis is how these cells began to intertwine, live together, mutate and change color, like an evolving system.\n\nWhat surprises me the most in this new series, is the stories appearing behind each new composition. See how these abstracts shapes can come to life and narrate us things through our imagination.\n\nEach color palette takes us into a different world, drawing a very specific atmosphere.\n\nAs me, let yourself be carried away by these stories 💫 !\n\nArtwork by Julien_Espagnon, 2022.\n\nControl : Press « S » to save the image as a PNG.",

This interactive minting project seeks to transform the traditional minting experience into something truly unique and unexpected.\n\nEach 'Portal' gives you access and 1x reserve for all future 'The Passage' experiences both virtual and IRL.\n\nFor more information, visit hereandnow.events or join the discord, and join us in redefining what it means to mint.\n\nSee LICENCE.md for license details.\n\nTECHNOLOGY :::::::::\n\nThis token is designed using a custom-built raymarching engine, built in a way that allows me to pass in chunks of GLSL code as determined by the params and features.\n\nThe geometry is generated using what's called a KIFS (Kaleidoscopic Iterated Function System) fractal, which involves taking the space, folding it, offsetting it, drawing in it, and repeating. By doing this, we can create some *very* complex appearing geometry using some relatively simple rules.\n\nFinally, this is an intense simulation and requires a somewhat powerful GPU to properly be enjoyed.\n\nCONTROLS :::::::::::\n\nMouse - Click and drag to move the camera around in the space.\nQ/E - Roll the camera.\nR/F - Change the speed of the camera.\nSPACE - Stop the camera from moving.\nO - Output a still picture without DOF.\nP - Output a still picture with DOF.\n\nURL PARAMS :::::::::\n\n&still=true\nThis will just render a still image.\n\n&dpr=X\nWhere X is a number. Will allow you to render the token to a higher or lower resolution\n\n&fullscreen=true\nAllows you to render the token at the screen resolution of your browser.\n\n&width=X &height=Y\nAllows you to set the specific dimensions of the token.\n\n&dof=true\nTurns fake depth of field on.\n\n&doflenngth=X\nChanges the length at with the DOF is calculated.\n\n&steps=X\nAllows you to explicitly set the number of steps the raymarcher can use.",

This interactive minting project seeks to transform the traditional minting experience into something truly unique and unexpected.\n\nEach 'Portal' gives you access and 1x reserve for all future 'The Passage' experiences both virtual and IRL.\n\nFor more information, visit hereandnow.events or join the discord, and join us in redefining what it means to mint.\n\nSee LICENCE.md for license details.\n\nTECHNOLOGY :::::::::\n\nThis token is designed using a custom-built raymarching engine, built in a way that allows me to pass in chunks of GLSL code as determined by the params and features.\n\nThe geometry is generated using what's called a KIFS (Kaleidoscopic Iterated Function System) fractal, which involves taking the space, folding it, offsetting it, drawing in it, and repeating. By doing this, we can create some *very* complex appearing geometry using some relatively simple rules.\n\nFinally, this is an intense simulation and requires a somewhat powerful GPU to properly be enjoyed.\n\nCONTROLS :::::::::::\n\nMouse - Click and drag to move the camera around in the space.\nQ/E - Roll the camera.\nR/F - Change the speed of the camera.\nSPACE - Stop the camera from moving.\nO - Output a still picture without DOF.\nP - Output a still picture with DOF.\n\nURL PARAMS :::::::::\n\n&still=true\nThis will just render a still image.\n\n&dpr=X\nWhere X is a number. Will allow you to render the token to a higher or lower resolution\n\n&fullscreen=true\nAllows you to render the token at the screen resolution of your browser.\n\n&width=X &height=Y\nAllows you to set the specific dimensions of the token.\n\n&dof=true\nTurns fake depth of field on.\n\n&doflenngth=X\nChanges the length at with the DOF is calculated.\n\n&steps=X\nAllows you to explicitly set the number of steps the raymarcher can use.",

The artwork and experience draw inspiration from the 'The Pitch Drop Experiment': the world's longest-running laboratory experiment. Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\nPitch is a group of materials that appear solid but are actually highly viscous liquids.\nThey shatter when struck, but also flow at an extremely slow rate.\n\nThese seemingly opposite properties raise questions about our perception of reality, as we experience space and movement on a determined timescale.\n\nInfluunt is a visual exploration of what could happen if space were to behave as pitch, flowing, bending, and shattering as we manipulate timescales and apply external forces by bending the rays of light.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://hereandnow.events/\n\nProcure a coin to participate in the event:\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/here-and-now:-edition-5\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current resolution\nPress 'H' to save the image at high resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nwwatkns\nMarch 2023",

            "description": "Schwere See\n(...which is german for \"Heavy Seas\")\n\nthis work creates completely generative ocean worlds between the real and the surreal.\nwhat is real? when do we feel reality? i guess as with many other things, we feel reality best when we're deprived of it.\nThat might be the reason why it never ceases to fascinate us to both exaggerate and abstract nature and reality - maybe even at the same time.\nthat's where this work tries to go...\ngiving my best to create realistic looking waves out of hmm... thin electron-gas..., and then disrupt those from realism by unnaturally exaggerating waveforms and abstracting the display to a few colors and lines - ...well, not so few of the latter, actually ;-)\n\nbeware: this needs a good GPU (at least here in 2023) to properly run in realtime.\nstills can still be rendered on a low end machine with on-board graphics, but for realtime playing you'd need some proper dedicated graphics card.\nand of course it wont run fast (or maybe not all) on your mobile phone (except maybe on a very high end device).\n\nthe different mints vary in wave shape, color, camera view, animation speed, aspect ratio, frame style, hatching density, field of view, and more.\nsome color schemes are based on pre-chosen palettes (slightly varied though), but others are wildly random-generated. there's always some risk in randomness, but lets give the error some chance to surprise us - this is one of the many benefits of generative art.\n\nas generative art can do so much more than just generate/show an image i feel almost obliged to add the possibility to animate/inteact.\nhowever, this extra control shall not be chosen without some considerations. \nyou don't want a strobingly wild animation above your fireplace or in a doctors waiting room. nor is it motion-wise very inspiring to have subtle image stills hanging in a dancefloor.\nso, by default when in animation mode (<space>-key) the scene is very slowly and steadily changing - some pieces faster, some slower. however, by pressing <f> you can toggle to a sped up animation of waves, clouds, and scene rotation.\nbtw, going faster in nav-mode also speeds up the wave animation. (...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

The vitriol then -- \"wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape\" (referring to Impression: sunrise by Monet) -- reminds me of criticism that generative art, and the NFT world more generally, are subject to now. \"Impossible cathedrals\" is a tribute to rebels who dare to see the world differently. \n\nSince generative art is often criticized as cold and austere, I took this as a challenge to reproduce the spirit of impressionism. Impossible cathedrals -- interwoven arches that cannot exist in reality -- hint at some of the favorite subjects of the impressionists.\n\nThe title alludes to Italo Calvino's novel Invisible Cities, a rebel in another context. Other artists who I had in mind during creation: the Japanese woodblock printing artists Kawase Hasui and Hiroshi Yoshida; American painter JAM Whistler.\n\nImpossible cathedrals was written in p5.js using elements of code by eeedg (thanks)",

As a result, some of the outputs might be weird, messy, or even bordering on broken (if you get one of the latter please let me know and I'll reimburse you).\n\nDespite being a bit rough around the edges, I hope fx(mash) reflects some measure of my love for the fxhash community. If you're feeling kind, then perhaps it even harks back to the experimental early days :)\n\nThe last year has been an incredible journey, thank you for letting me be a part of our story so far.\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press [s] to save the current image\n- Press [g] to toggle grain\n- Press [h] for a high-res output\n\nBeta Controls (in live view, definitely not fully tested):\n\n- Press [p] to start/pause animation\n- Press [i] to slow down animation\n- Press [o] to speed up animation\n\nAll primary sales go to Savepakistan.\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nfx(mash) uses Gorilla Sun's grain implementation, a big thanks to him and meezwhite for a great article that is well worth supporting https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/all-about-that-grain\n\nThank you to the artists who created the following collections. Some were the source for palettes, others directly inspired traits, and some I thought would be fun to include as specific trait values.\n\nPalettes:\n\nArchetype / Kjetil Golid / @kgolid\nCHROMATLAS / Aleksandra Jovanić / @alexis_o_O\nContrapuntos / Marcelo Soria-Rodriguez / @msoriaro\nCuts / Todemashi / @todemashi\nEdifice / Ben Kovach / @bendotk\nEthereal Microcosm / ciphrd / @ciphrd\nFactura / Mathias Isaksen / @st4yhome_art\nFarbteiler / Erik Swahn / @erikswahn\nFidenza / Tyler Hobbs / @tylerxhobbs\nGarden Monoliths / Zancan / @zancan\ng l a s s / punevyr / @punevyr\nGRAPHEME / Sarah Ridgley / @sarah_ridgley\nLoom / Andreas Rau / @andreasrau_eu\nMemories of Qilin / Emily Xie / @emilyxxie\nMeridian / Matt DesLauriers / @mattdesl\nMillefoglie / Stefano Contiero / @stefan_contiero\nMountain View / Florian Berger / @flockaroo\nNetwork C / Casey REAS / @reas\nProxima / Jacek Markusiewicz & IsmaHelio / @jMarkusiewicz & @ismahelios\nReading a Book / Kim Asendorf / @kimasendorf\nResistance Effect / Itzel Yard / @ix_shells\nScreens / Thomas Lin Pedersen / @thomasp85\nSedimentary Dissolution / landlinesart / @landlinesart1\nSeptember / Tyler Boswell / @teaboswell\nSolace / lunarean / @lunarean\nSVRFACED / Lisa Orth / @lisaorthstudio\nTBOA / Shvembldr / @shvembldr\nTrossets / Anna Carreras / @carreras_anna\nThe Fire Within / Wen / @yiwen_lin\nZee / Lucas Reveil / @reveil_s\n\nTraits and Trait Names:\n\nAlley / Jinyao Lin / @jinyaolin\nArrangement / Eltono / @eltono\nArt For Walls In Public Spaces / Anna Lucia / @annaluciacodes\nBound / David Brice Allen & ajberni / @davidbriceallen & @ajberni\nA Bugged Forest / Zancan / @zancan\nCellular Automaton / ciphrd / @ciphrd\nCENTURY-XXX-METAMOLNAR(S) / Casey REAS / @reas\nCosmic Type / Mark Webster / @motiondesign_01\nDe/Frag / Karsten Schmidt / @toxi\nDisrupted / rudxane / @rudxane1\nDragons / William Mapan / @williamapan\nEchos / Jeff / @ippsketch\nEnfantines / (rat)chitect - Alejandro / @ratchitect\nGeode & Gossamer / Lars Wander / @larswander\nHashed Cities / Yazid / @Yazid\nHeavy Light / ECKER_O_ / @ecker_o\nHorizon(te)s / Iskra Velitchkova & Zach Lieberman / @pointline_ & @zachlieberman\nHypergiraffe / Piter Pasma / @piterpasma\nImpressions of Order / nbswwit / @nbswwit\nInconvergent / inconvergent / @inconvergent\nMonolith / Ganchitecture & Orr Kislev / @ganchitecture & @OrrKislev\nOde to Random / Yazid / @Yazid\nRepeater / Michael Connolly / @xiiixiii\nSmolskull / Mark Knol / @mknol\nSymmetriclew / abstractment / @abstractment\nTowers / ertdfgcvb / @andreasgysin\nTych / rudxane / @rudxane1",
