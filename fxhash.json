            "description": "This work is composed of a combination of grids with line patterns, like my previous work \"Infinite Animation\" (Project #15745).  However, whereas the previous work was characterized by simplicity and regularity, this one is much more chaotic.\n\nFirst, while in the previous work the grids were fixed at 3 x 3, in this work there are variations from 5 x 5 to 20 x 20. \nAnd in this work, it is YOU who rotates the grid. Clicking on a grid rotates it 90 degrees and changes the image. If you have difficulty locating the grid, press the \"g\" key on the keyboard to display a guide (for touch devices, long press to show/hide the guide).\nIf you get tired of clicking, you can ask your computer to help you. You can toggle the animation mode with the \"a\" key on the keyboard (for touch devices, swipe up to turn on the mode, swipe down to turn it off). In animation mode, the computer rotates a random grid at regular intervals. (The surrounding frame turns green in animation mode.)\n\nThe fun of generative art lies in finding value, or to stretch the point a bit, destiny, in the random coincidences created by computers. Therefore, it is not aesthetically pleasing to artificially modify the derived result later. However, dynamism is also a characteristic of digital art. The fluidity of the results is probably one of its interesting features. I experimented with it in my previous work, \"Abstract Calligraphy\"(Project #15384), and have done it more characteristically in this project.\n\nThis picture is like a puzzle game, but there is no correct answer. No, there may be a correct answer. It depends on your aesthetic sense. Let's enjoy collaborating with the computer!",

            "description": "Ries is 500 sheets of paper. \nRies is an cut-up text-artwork.\nRies is artwork generated by an algorithm based on seeded random numbers.\nRies is a digital artwork installed in 5 forms in exhibitions setting.\nRies is an NFT artwork. \n\nRies is an artwork where I try bring together my experience of doing gallery exhibitions, my love for generative and copy machine art, DIY-punk aesthetics, NFT’s and chaos. \n\nThe edition of Ries will be installed in different forms and collages in a gallery exhibition in Walden Kunstaustellungen in Berlin in July of 2022. Opening is at 8.7. 19.00, welcome if you are in Berlin.\n/www.galerie-walden.de/\n\nThe seed idea for the project was the method of cut-up where a text (or something else) is cut into pieces and then rearranged to form something new. A modified Markov’s Chain algorithm makes a small text or a group of words from a pool of texts that include Art texts about cut up technique and generative art talk from tweets. These words form a visual bottom layer and then another layer of words samples the first, cutting it up and thus following the theme of the artwork.\n\nSince the single iterations of the project are designed to be used in a collage, they come in various tone, density, detail and scale. One can test from the variations button and get a sense of what the generator produces. \n\nControls in live view:\n-Pressing  j exports the current image as jpeg\n-Pressing  p  exports the current image as png\n\nTo change the detail level one can access the pixel density of render by adding ?pixDens=4 to the end of the URL in live view. You can of course you any number other than 4 also. I it renders just a black image, you have to lower the number, since it is then too large for WEBGL to render.\n\nDesigned to be best rendered on desktop Chrome.\n\nPricing info\n22 tez - Includes a gallery shown, signed print sent to minter by mail or by telefax(!)\n11 tez - A fair price for an artwork, also the minter can personally pick up a signed gallery shown print from the gallery, after the exhibition.\n5 tez - 1/2 fair price\n2 tez - bottom dollar\n\nIf you minted on lower tiers and would want a print, please contact the artist per twitter dm to “upgrade”. If you bought secondary, and would want a print, please contact the artist per twitter dm.\n\nFeatures exist mostly to help with artwork pairing for the collectors.\n\n\nMarkov’s chain code core is based on Markov Me! By https://codepen.io/alexkramerbanjo , MIT License\n\nDisplacement shader based on the wonderful shader examples by Adam Ferris\n\n\nThe artist holds the right to use the whole edition of Ries for display purposes for future exhibitions without asking permission or notifying the owners of the NFT’s.\n\n1.7.2022 in Berlin\nAntti Pussinen\n\nwww.anttipussinen.net\nwww.twitter.com/antti_pussinen\nwww.instagram.com/anttipussinen\n",

For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

            "description": "This work is composed of a combination of grids with line patterns, like my previous work \"Infinite Animation\" (Project #15745).  However, whereas the previous work was characterized by simplicity and regularity, this one is much more chaotic.\n\nFirst, while in the previous work the grids were fixed at 3 x 3, in this work there are variations from 5 x 5 to 20 x 20. \nAnd in this work, it is YOU who rotates the grid. Clicking on a grid rotates it 90 degrees and changes the image. If you have difficulty locating the grid, press the \"g\" key on the keyboard to display a guide (for touch devices, long press to show/hide the guide).\nIf you get tired of clicking, you can ask your computer to help you. You can toggle the animation mode with the \"a\" key on the keyboard (for touch devices, swipe up to turn on the mode, swipe down to turn it off). In animation mode, the computer rotates a random grid at regular intervals. (The surrounding frame turns green in animation mode.)\n\nThe fun of generative art lies in finding value, or to stretch the point a bit, destiny, in the random coincidences created by computers. Therefore, it is not aesthetically pleasing to artificially modify the derived result later. However, dynamism is also a characteristic of digital art. The fluidity of the results is probably one of its interesting features. I experimented with it in my previous work, \"Abstract Calligraphy\"(Project #15384), and have done it more characteristically in this project.\n\nThis picture is like a puzzle game, but there is no correct answer. No, there may be a correct answer. It depends on your aesthetic sense. Let's enjoy collaborating with the computer!",
