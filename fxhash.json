It's a matter of perspective and scale, as rotation and simple geometry combine to produce a spiritual successor to my piece ‘A Clock at the Heart of the Universe’.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Variable palettes, centred around a main hue: Some diverge rapidly, others stick tightly to this central value. Monochrome palettes are available as a rare mint.\n- Render modes: The background and main layer are rendered simultaneously, so the order in which the rays are produced affects the final output. Some renders produce orderly, predictable output; others take randomness to heart and work busily across the canvas.\n- Ray styles: Density, related to the number of rays, affects the radial spokes of the piece. Some renders are sparse and minimalist, others crowd varying sizes onto each line.\n- Aspect ratios: Whilst the default 1:1 ratio is common, other aspect ratios, right up to an ultrawide option, are possible.\n- Sound: Modern browsers require you to click on the sketch and activate sound by pressing 'm' to hear the soundtrack to this piece.\n- Halo style: Circles, or less commonly squares, form this mid-ground detail, itself affected by the colour palette and with the possibility of variable or regular sizing.\n- Canvas styles: Halving or quartering is possible, though rare, and an offset may take place, shifting the focus of the piece off centre, but taking into account any vertical or horizontal splits.\n- Texturing: Drawn towards the centre of the piece, the main hue is applied as a grainy motif.\n- Hidden features: There is a clock at the heart of the universe.",

Each piece expresses a strong sense of social commitment that goes beyond words and manifests itself through art.\n\nEach work invites reflection on the current state of our society. Justice should be a universal right for every individual, but too often it becomes a matter of money and power.\nThese artworks speak to the viewer on a visceral level, inviting them to contemplate the injustices in our world and to take action.",

            "description": "Adjacent is the third in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art. This piece focuses on the study of Diagonal White, a series he developed between 1970 and 1975.\n\nIn 1976, Ruth Leavitt published a collection of papers titled \"Artist & Computer\", which highlighted the 35 prominent generative artists and asked them to discuss their work. They were posed questions like, \"Do you feel art work created with a computer has now or will have an impact on art as a whole in the future?\". Edward Zajec was a subject of one of those papers and in it detailed the approach to Diagonal White. \n\nThe original program was run on a CDC 6200 computer at The Univeresiry of Trieste. The programming was done in collaboration with Dr. Matjaz Hmeljak, his long-time technical partner. Inspired by his collaborative relationship, Adjacent the output of a partnership between Christine Hall and Chris Maddern.\n\nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to save a high-resolution version of the image\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nBy @christine_hall and @chrismaddern",

Your experience with the painting requires trust; trust that something will appear from the chaos of the empty space, trust that the composition you imagine halfway through will evolve along with your ideas, and trust that the etchings lend a helping hand to the message of the piece. You may find yourself pulled left and right when decisions are made, and your interpretation at 25%, 50%, and 90% will all differ. This is what makes creating so fulfilling to me, a work of art can change course wildly from start to finish, ever molding itself until it enters the kiln.\n\nPress ‘1’, ‘2’, or  ‘3’ to increase resolution (default is 1, higher than default may not work on certain browsers.

Are we a mere accident, created by the forces of nature, or are we hand-crafted by god himself? If we are a coincidence, the chances of humanity happening are absurdly minuscule. If we were hand-crafted by God, then how could it be possible that God is eternal, yet he was incarnated as the finite, human Jesus? That doesn’t make sense.\n\nWhy are we here? Well… We don’t know. And if you think about it, why should we? And why do we even need a purpose? Isn’t just existing enough to satisfy us? Humanity’s search for a meaning is plainly absurd, because it is simply undiscoverable. \nSisyphus can be considered the embodiment of the human struggle against the absurd. He is condemned to push a boulder up a hill every day, for eternity. He, and us, must struggle with the meaninglessness of our existance, without any real hope of succeeding.\n\nBut what if we don’t consider purposeness as something negative? What if we just enjoy our lives, with the full knowledge that they have no meaning whatsoever?\n\n“One must imagine Sisyphus happy” - Albert Camus.\n\n\n\nSketch written in pure JS.",

A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time.\n \nRichter works with data from 4 of 24 highres images, 30mb in total. This is the maximum size fxhash allows for a project and three times more than Gerhard. Richard Nadler created stunning new textures, enabling more variation in composition and detail to emerge at much higher resolution. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Richter elevates the approach from Gerhard with new methods for the realtime rendering process and new features like offline-first caching. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels as data.\n \nRichter is featured in the exhibition \"Generative Abstraction\" at Expanded.art in Berlin.\n \n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color.\n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen.\n- Press “s” to save the canvas.\n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nleanderherzog.ch/2023/richter/\nleanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/\nfxhash.xyz/generative/17030/",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",
