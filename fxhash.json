            "description": "This piece is a reflection of my passions, a blend of the visual and the auditory, and a testament to the power of interdisciplinary inspiration.\n\nAt the very core of 'Cable Management' lies the mesmerizing aura of 'Impressions of Order' by nbswwit. This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.\n\nMy deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.\n\nAn algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.\n\nNavigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. \n\nAnd lastly, a heartfelt dedication. Through every line of code, every algorithm tweak, she remained my rock. Alice, as you embrace another year, this piece is not just an ode to my creative journey but also a heartfelt tribute to you, my biggest supporter since the outset. This project, and every beat of my heart, is for you. <3\n\n3500x4953px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

            "description": "What is Chaos? It can be something different from person to person. One might think it’s random acts, and others might think it’s uncontrollable forces. I feel like Chaos is unruly, surprising, and destructive. \n\nThen what is Ordo (Order) then? Ordo is structured and controlling. Ordo tries to take Chaos and wrap it up in a box with a bow. It tries to control the uncontrollable.\n\nThat is the basis of thought when I started building Ordo versus Chaos. The chaotic structures are based on waveforms and gradients. Some waves are smooth, while others are jagged and saw-like. The chaotic systems unapologetically destroy elements written to the canvas before them. They will sway in a seemingly soft wave and suddenly change directions. Overlapping waves can leave moiré patterns behind as it travels along.\n\nThe Ordo comes from trying to contain the Chaos in repeating patterns. Chaos’s diagonal, vertical, and horizontal sections are mirrored to include the waveforms in a specific area. Chaos is still destructive, but it’s contained and orderly.\n\nOrdo versus Chaos is built with p5.js with the help of (fx)lens to test variations. \n\nFeatures:\n---------------------------------\nDimensions: Size of the canvas, 12x12, 12x18, 9x16\nPick Pallet: Pallet picked from the top 100 pallets from http://colourlovers.com/\nColor Dist: Amount of colors generated between each color in the chosen pallet\nDensity: helps determines the amount of waves that will be generated.\nOrientation: Canvas Orientation\nDust: the amount of dust particles on the canvas\nScratches: the number of scratches on the canvas, based on the Dust value\nOrdo Or Chaos: Whether to render the waves in Ordo or Chaos mode.\nOrdo Split: How the Ordo will display the waves.

            "description": "What is Chaos? It can be something different from person to person. One might think it’s random acts, and others might think it’s uncontrollable forces. I feel like Chaos is unruly, surprising, and destructive. \n\nThen what is Ordo (Order) then? Ordo is structured and controlling. Ordo tries to take Chaos and wrap it up in a box with a bow. It tries to control the uncontrollable.\n\nThat is the basis of thought when I started building Ordo versus Chaos. The chaotic structures are based on waveforms and gradients. Some waves are smooth, while others are jagged and saw-like. The chaotic systems unapologetically destroy elements written to the canvas before them. They will sway in a seemingly soft wave and suddenly change directions. Overlapping waves can leave moiré patterns behind as it travels along.\n\nThe Ordo comes from trying to contain the Chaos in repeating patterns. Chaos’s diagonal, vertical, and horizontal sections are mirrored to include the waveforms in a specific area. Chaos is still destructive, but it’s contained and orderly.\n\nOrdo versus Chaos is built with p5.js with the help of (fx)lens to test variations. \n\nFeatures:\n---------------------------------\nDimensions: Size of the canvas, 12x12, 12x18, 9x16\nPick Pallet: Pallet picked from the top 100 pallets from http://colourlovers.com/\nColor Dist: Amount of colors generated between each color in the chosen pallet\nDensity: helps determines the amount of waves that will be generated.\nOrientation: Canvas Orientation\nDust: the amount of dust particles on the canvas\nScratches: the number of scratches on the canvas, based on the Dust value\nOrdo Or Chaos: Whether to render the waves in Ordo or Chaos mode.\nOrdo Split: How the Ordo will display the waves. There are three, split diagonally, in halves, and fourths.\nOrdo Split Dir: Axis to split the Ordo mode on\n\nRoyalties Splits:\n---------------------------------\n50% Donation to minter\n\nKeys\n---------------------------------\nExport to a PNG format at several different sizes.\n- Press s: save the current render size\n- Press t: scale to screen size\n- Press f: full print size (see features for dimensions)",

Each plan is a unique variation on semantic relations between architectural elements: from a regular composition resembling existing churches to a dynamic aggregation of vaults, columns and chevets. But always following the same set of rules extracted from multiple examples of gothic cathedrals.\n\nEvery church has its place and time in which it could have been built in an alternative series of historical events.\n\nThis artistic tribute to the research of Stiny and Mitchell about Palladian architecture or Duarte's work about Siza takes the topic of formalizing architectural language onto a lighthearted level by moving it to a slightly imaginary world.\n\nTo zoom, press a mouse button when over the image or touch the screen.

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",
