            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

It was a dream to be able to make a collection of Dots on Fxhash, now it finally happened. Initially we only had 1 color palette, however, to create more variety, this project has 7 color palettes. To create the palettes we chose 5 famous artists to honor, including Peter Halley, Max Bill, Piet Mondrian, Sophie Taeuber and Lygia Clark, in addition to the palettes created by us. The project has several grids and some new possibilities in addition to the pieces already created on other platforms. It is with great pride and joy that we present this project made with great affection. Enjoy!\n\nPress [S] to save a image",

            "description": "\"Euphoria\" embodies my pleasurable exploration and playfulness in geometry to produce a whole unit of an image that reminds me of my old cubist painting exercises. \"Euphoria\" ends from diagonal lines to different levels of flat color, surfaces, and shapes. The scene of this work in forms creates small boxes with fragile perspectives; this performance challenges the root concept that art should copy nature. A theme that is evident in all my works. Therefore, the unusual geometrical divisions generate outstanding space in the flat forms.\nAngles are generated that may simultaneously form a two-way perspective. It is a sensory experience imposed by the \"external sense\" and time similarly by the \"internal sense.\" It is the experience of a visual world that combines the visual aura of space and time. According to Kant, such a combination is the foundation of self-awareness.\nAccording to him, intuitions should \"move through each other and be held together.\" That is, they should be placed in time and some of them in place (the spatial component appears as a position outside intuition). Second, the previous intuitions must be placed next to the current intuitions to form a single body.\nThis process constitutes the initial formalist. Such a method is undoubtedly an attempt to abandon all resemblance to natural form and to create a completely abstract language of form, including a visual symphony. \"Euphoria\" strives to achieve abstract minimalism by exploring new geometric structures, using algorithms, and building them into code structures.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

We all feel this way from time to time — in our lives, jobs, bodies, situations — yet in our search for something, we shouldn't forget that there can still be beauty along the path.\n\nThe project takes some inspiration from Henri Matisse, both in the aesthetics of his later works (i.e. the \"Cut Outs\") and metaphorically in the sense that he had underwent medical treatment which left him wheelchair- or bed-bound towards the later part of his life, forcing him to give up painting, yet in his exploration of this new creative medium which involved cutting paper and pinning them up, his unorthodox work went on to become the most transformative of his career.\n\nReleased as part of the 4th edition of the Cure³ Parkinson's cure fundraiser exhibition organized by Artwise Curators and Bonhams as part of a specially comissioned selection of generative artists minting NFTs, curated by Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick with the support of fx(hash) at Bonhams, London from 13-17th January 2023.\n\n---\n33% of primary sales and 3% of secondary sales will be donated on-chain to Cure Parkinson’s\n---\n\nControls:\n• 'R' regenerates the piece (e.g. in case the window size changes)\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Jan 2023\nArtist: Yazid",

            "description": "Hus is a temporal generative art data visualization about care work and gender. Each variation of the work provides a unique perspective of the gender gap in care work within Danish society. Utilizing time and movement as a visualizer technique, the underlying data set is meant to be  understood by the spectator through prolonged exposure to the work. \n\nHus changes its expression over a 24 hour cycle to visualize how care work can be understood to be split between men, women and queer people in Danish society. Each of the three main colors in Hus correspond to a different group of people. Each group has different movements, corresponding to how the data shows that they approach care work. \n\nThe data comes from the report “Hvordan bruger danskerne tiden?” from 2018 by Rockwool Fonden. The report does not include data for queer people, and they are therefore included as a separate group with a somewhat random pattern of movements to emphasize the lack of representation in research. \n\nHus is released in collaboration with OFFICE IMPART as part of Node — a platform to explore the Boundaries of Digital Art. \n\n· Interactions ·\n\nPressing the following keys will trigger functionality. Some of them also add related URL parameters.\n\nPressing I will save the piece as an image. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nPressing V will start recording a video. Pressing it again will stop recording and save the video. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nPressing C will cycle through the color schemes.\n\nPressing F will toggle between fast forwarding the animation.\n\nPressing A will toggle between autoplay mode.\n\nPressing U will toggle full screen mode.\n\nPressing T will toggle between freezing Hus in current time.\n\nPressing N will show a new random variation and clear the URL parameters.\n\n· URL parameters ·\n\nYou can add the following parameters to the URL to change the behavior of the piece.\n\nimage=true — Save the piece as an image on page load.\n\ncolor=<number> — See the piece in another color scheme. The numbers loop around, so 12 equals 0, 13 equals 1, etc.\n\nfastforward=true — Start Hus in fast forward mode.\n\nautoplay=true — Run autoplay mode which cycles through new variations every minute.\n\nfullscreen=true — Start Hus in fullscreen mode.\n\ntime=<HH:MM:SS> — See how Hus looks at a specific time of day. Use the format HH:MM:SS.\n\n· Accessibility ·\n\nHus is built to support screen readers. It has been tested using MacOS’ VoiceOver, and uses custom code to provide screen reader functionality.\n\nWhen saving an image, Hus produces an image description that can be used when sharing on social media to improve accessibility. \n\nIf you have any comments (good or bad) on the screen reader integration, don’t hesitate to reach out.\n\n· Credits and license ·\n\nHus is made with Three.js.\n\nHus is licensed under a modified version of the Climate Strike License (CSL).",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "This artwork is a fusion of technical mastery and emotional depth, a mesmerizing composition of countless tiny strokes that together depict a vibrant bouquet of flowers cradled in a vase. Each stroke, meticulously generated through code, is more than a pixel on a screen; it's a testament to the painstaking process of its creation and to my inner struggle.\n\nDuring a period of creative drought, I found myself grappling with the vast canvas of my imagination, striving to bring forth ideas that stubbornly lingered beneath the surface. The struggle to birth a new masterpiece mirrored the blank canvas before me, a formidable opponent that reflected my creative void.\n\nEmerging from this struggle is the painting itself, a testament to my evolution. Each flower, resplendent in its multi-hued glory, signifies an idea that eventually bloomed in the arid landscape of my imagination. They are not just flowers, but symbols of triumph over artistic adversity, each one born of relentless determination, countless hours, and a deep-seated resolve.\n\nThe bouquet is a symphony of colors, textures, and shapes, with each tiny stroke having its own purpose, its own identity. Together, these strokes bring forth a visual effect reminiscent of Impasto Oil Painting, offering a sense of depth and volume, a tactile quality that seems to lift the flowers off the canvas. Each one was placed carefully, deliberately, with precision guided by complex algorithms and a vision of the bigger picture they were part of.\n\nThe vase, a beacon of silver and gray amidst the riotous bloom, represents me. It is the vessel that contains and supports the bouquet, much like how I channel my creativity into a myriad of ideas, each one blooming into an individual stroke on the canvas.\n\nThis painting serves as a reminder that the creation of something beautiful and meaningful often starts small. The blooming flowers did not appear overnight. They are the result of thousands of tiny strokes, each one placed carefully, deliberately, and with a firm belief in the bigger picture they were part of.\n\nIn essence, the vase of flowers is not just a painting, but a story - my story - of struggle, perseverance, and the power of tiny, incremental steps towards a grand vision. It is a testament to the fact that great things often start small, and in the end, every stroke counts.\n\nArtist's Note:\n\nPlease be aware that due to the complexity and depth of the layers of shaders involved in creating the \"Flowers of Progress\", the artwork might take a bit of time to load or may not work on some devices. For a high-resolution image that captures the details and vibrancy of this work, simply click 'S' to export a reasonable high-quality image. Thank you for your understanding, and for joining me on this journey of artistic exploration and growth.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023 by Abdi Morris\nThis generative artwork is licensed under Apache License\nindex.js:476 http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0",

            "description": "This artwork is a fusion of technical mastery and emotional depth, a mesmerizing composition of countless tiny strokes that together depict a vibrant bouquet of flowers cradled in a vase. Each stroke, meticulously generated through code, is more than a pixel on a screen; it's a testament to the painstaking process of its creation and to my inner struggle.\n\nDuring a period of creative drought, I found myself grappling with the vast canvas of my imagination, striving to bring forth ideas that stubbornly lingered beneath the surface. The struggle to birth a new masterpiece mirrored the blank canvas before me, a formidable opponent that reflected my creative void.\n\nEmerging from this struggle is the painting itself, a testament to my evolution. Each flower, resplendent in its multi-hued glory, signifies an idea that eventually bloomed in the arid landscape of my imagination. They are not just flowers, but symbols of triumph over artistic adversity, each one born of relentless determination, countless hours, and a deep-seated resolve.\n\nThe bouquet is a symphony of colors, textures, and shapes, with each tiny stroke having its own purpose, its own identity. Together, these strokes bring forth a visual effect reminiscent of Impasto Oil Painting, offering a sense of depth and volume, a tactile quality that seems to lift the flowers off the canvas. Each one was placed carefully, deliberately, with precision guided by complex algorithms and a vision of the bigger picture they were part of.\n\nThe vase, a beacon of silver and gray amidst the riotous bloom, represents me. It is the vessel that contains and supports the bouquet, much like how I channel my creativity into a myriad of ideas, each one blooming into an individual stroke on the canvas.\n\nThis painting serves as a reminder that the creation of something beautiful and meaningful often starts small. The blooming flowers did not appear overnight. They are the result of thousands of tiny strokes, each one placed carefully, deliberately, and with a firm belief in the bigger picture they were part of.\n\nIn essence, the vase of flowers is not just a painting, but a story - my story - of struggle, perseverance, and the power of tiny, incremental steps towards a grand vision. It is a testament to the fact that great things often start small, and in the end, every stroke counts.\n\nArtist's Note:\n\nPlease be aware that due to the complexity and depth of the layers of shaders involved in creating the \"Flowers of Progress\", the artwork might take a bit of time to load or may not work on some devices. For a high-resolution image that captures the details and vibrancy of this work, simply click 'S' to export a reasonable high-quality image. Thank you for your understanding, and for joining me on this journey of artistic exploration and growth.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2023 by Abdi Morris\nThis generative artwork is licensed under Apache License\nindex.js:476 http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",
