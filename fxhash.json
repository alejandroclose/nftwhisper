            "description": "This is a work about growth, impermanence and decay. Ghostly plants and flowers grow around an invisible point, but they immediately begin to fade into the dark background and are soon replaced and covered by others. This process of accumulation and disappearance builds an ever-changing floral garland, or perhaps a funeral wreath.\n\nThe monochrome vegetation is part of a fictional flora, born out of random algorithmic combinations, and does not intend to reproduce any real species. It belongs to an “artificial nature” which, like so many worlds that the computers generate for us in movies, games, and virtual reality environments, is a convincing simulation of life, but it is not actually living. AI bots, virtual assistants and non-player characters are also representatives of the uncanny realm of the not-really-alive-but-looking-like-it, which are becoming an increasingly relevant presence in our everyday lives.\n\nThese plants and flowers speak about life as a process of incessant renovation, but also about death as the background that’s always there and makes life possible. This spectral vegetation seems to thrive precisely at the verge between both worlds.\n_______________\n\n\nThis work is animated and will adapt to any screen size. It generates a never-ending ring of algorithmic foliage, which never repeats itself, and is different for each token. The image preview is triggered after the first five plants or flowers.\nMade with p5.js\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture",

Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "This project is my first one in a series of algorithmic studies. Inspired by the work of Casey Reas and his \"Process Compendium\", it starts with a very simple text description of an algorithmic process. In this case, I came up this description:\n\n\"Place N circles randomly on the canvas. Select a point on each of the circles, and rotate it around its circle. At each step, draw a random line that connects all the points\"\n\nEach step is drawn with very low opacity, and is repeated a large number of times (these pieces draw around 6 million lines). Eventually, complex structures, shapes and patterns appear, that were impossible to predict from the text description alone: this is an emergent system.\n\nThe text description voluntarily leaves things open to interpretation: how many points ? which colors to use ? which rules for the drawing opacity and line weight ? Do all points move at the same speed ? Can they accelerate ? Are the circles allowed to extend past the canvas boundaries ?\n\nThis makes the process capable of interesting variations, as well as reusable: another artist implementation of the same description would most likely give very different artworks.\n\nDespite the apparent simplicity of the description, this collection ended up being a real challenge. Drawing millions of lines with low opacity turned out to be impossible without a GPU. WebGL is required.\n\nThis token uses the regl.js library. The outputs are rendered at 2400x2400 and should be viewed at that size. You can generate high resolution outputs, up to 8000px, by adding &size=XXXX to the URL.",

            "description": "\nThe \"Focal Point\" series showcases a unique combination of four square artworks arranged in the shape of a plus sign on a textured brown paper. The central motif present in each artwork is an anchor, which also serves as the basis for the color palette throughout the series. The artist began by digitally creating a precisionist central artwork which led to further creation of 28 total artworks, divided into four sets, each set representing a direction.\n\nThe symmetry of the resulting form is striking, with the four squares perfectly aligning to create a cohesive and balanced composition. The use of textured brown paper as the background adds depth and dimension to the series, creating an interesting contrast with the clean lines and geometric shapes of the artworks.\n\nThe series is an exploration of unity and balance, using the plus sign, a symbol of addition, congruence and equilibrium, to visually represent the idea that by bringing different elements together, a new and harmonious whole can be formed. \n\nThe artist's intent is to convey that despite our differences in physical and intellectual attributes, we are all the same at our core. \n\n20% of the proceeds from this project will be donated to Southern Exposure, an artist-centered non-profit organization committed to supporting visual artists, that has been in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1974.\n\nFor more information regarding my past and upcoming projects, please visit meditationsincolor.com.\n",

I'm putting it out as a limited release with some organization imposed on the placement of the beads. Hopefully someone will find a rare one with 8 spheres!\n\nRoyalties will be shared with THREE.js and Girls Who Code as I have chosen to support both causes in all of my work starting with Orbital Plowing v1.0.\n\nContinuing my experiment to create very realistic glass spheres that can be manipulated and moved within the THREE.js environment. The glass spheres move in unusual orbital paths plowing through a field of hundreds of plastic beads of various sizes.\n\nExtremely rare to get 8 glass spheres... By the randomness imposed, 30% will have one sphere, 30% two, 20% three, 10% four, 5% five, 3.5% six, 1% seven and 0.5% eight. Happy hunting!\n\nInteractive with several user controls:\n\nWith the mouse:\n\nLeft click and drag to change the viewing angle\nRight click and drag to change the view center\nMouse wheel to change the distance to the view center\n\nWith the keyboard:\n\nKeys \",\" and \".\" (i.e. \"<\" and \">\") change the rotation speed left or right. You can stop it entirely, or speed it up to what I consider a reasonable maximum, rotating to the left or to the right. Each time you press, it adjusts the rotation speed.\n\nPress \"a\" to change the lighting angle.",

            "description": "\nThe \"Focal Point\" series showcases a unique combination of four square artworks arranged in the shape of a plus sign on a textured brown paper. The central motif present in each artwork is an anchor, which also serves as the basis for the color palette throughout the series. The artist began by digitally creating a precisionist central artwork which led to further creation of 28 total artworks, divided into four sets, each set representing a direction.\n\nThe symmetry of the resulting form is striking, with the four squares perfectly aligning to create a cohesive and balanced composition. The use of textured brown paper as the background adds depth and dimension to the series, creating an interesting contrast with the clean lines and geometric shapes of the artworks.\n\nThe series is an exploration of unity and balance, using the plus sign, a symbol of addition, congruence and equilibrium, to visually represent the idea that by bringing different elements together, a new and harmonious whole can be formed. \n\nThe artist's intent is to convey that despite our differences in physical and intellectual attributes, we are all the same at our core. \n\n20% of the proceeds from this project will be donated to Southern Exposure, an artist-centered non-profit organization committed to supporting visual artists, that has been in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1974.\n\nFor more information regarding my past and upcoming projects, please visit meditationsincolor.com.\n",

And while we devise systems for solving unfathomably complex problems, generating algorithmic creativity, and unlocking regenerative biological possibilities, we simultaneously cling to the power and originality of emotional feeling – believing it to be the irreplaceable source of what makes us human.\n\nIf the body is our shell for emotion and soul, can an artificial humanoid be another vessel for these thoughts and feelings – for human essence itself? If our ‘soul’ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable? That we may see answers to these questions looks more real every year, and is perhaps a little frightening. \n\nEmotional Shell uses introspective portraits of future selves to question what it means to be human, when the people around us are no longer human.\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 1-3 to select from low, medium, and high quality settings\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2400px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nTENDER x wwatkns\nAugust 2022",
