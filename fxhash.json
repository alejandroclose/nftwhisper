            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms.

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

Perspective and perception can be so different.\n\nBased on some of my photos from the last 365 days that trigger emotional memories, even if they are not directly connected. By the way, Fischbach is the name of the small village where I grew up. It was a great time!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach piece uses pairs of photos and colors (top/bottom).\n\nThe animated collage itself is based on two layers. The first layer uses a double buffer to cut, colorize and animate the photos. The second layer is mainly just for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nCutting and pasting photos is based on a variable moving color grid, the fixed horizon, the variable position of the photos top/bottom, the previous buffer and some magic distance calculations between them.\n\nThe grid itself is a combination of vertical color stripes with variable position and distance factors that determine the color gradient between the two colors, and folds that alternate between the two colors depending on the horizontal and vertical values.\n\nEspecially the entropy of the photos and the colored grid influence the pixel movement.\n\nAnimation changes are triggered after a random number of frames and effect folds, stripes and photo position. These replace parts of the current collage (fade to black) or add some (discard fragment updates).\n\nFeatures:\n\n- top color [12] - hue, colorful & bright\n- bottom color [6] - hue, less colorful & bright\n- top photo [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ♠4, driften, brand-pyramide, zäpfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- bottom photo: [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ♠4, driften, brand-pyramide, zäpfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- horizon [0.618, 0.5, 0.382] (down, center, up)\n- hectic [3, 5, 11] (calm, slightly, very)\n- horizontal folds [113, 365, 997, 2153, 3987] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- vertical folds [7, 37, 127, 571, 1501, 3147] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- min stripes [1, 3, 5] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 300 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar, mouse click or tap touch to trigger animation changes\n- `c` to take a picture\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `p` to pause\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- autopause - enable automatic pausing\n- pixelratio=2 - sets the pixel ratio (default: device)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=10 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

            "description": "A Cellular Dice Piece\n\nComputational modeling is the use of computers to simulate and study complex systems using mathematics, physics and computer science. A computational model contains numerous variables that characterize the system being studied. Simulation is done by adjusting the variables alone or in combination and observing the outcomes. Computer modeling allows scientists to conduct thousands of simulated experiments by computer. The thousands of computer experiments identify the handful of laboratory experiments that are most likely to solve the problem being studied.\n\nToday's sociocultural discourse might obscure the fact that humanity has been using artificial modeling techniques since ancient times. Permutations, calculus, algorithms are not exclusive to our time, but these are ubiquituous methods that can be found in many cultural entities where members of the community progress and develop their environment through cooperative decisions and consensus. Since computers were not available in the past, calculation methods, application of chance, randomness and probability were performed using other methods, like dices, sticks, cards, weather, rituals or other manifestations.\n\nDice are small, throwable objects with marked sides that can rest in multiple positions. They are used for generating random numbers, commonly as part of tabletop games, including dice games, board games, role-playing games, and games of chance. A traditional die is a cube with each of its six faces marked with a different number of dots (pips) from one to six. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing a random integer from one to six on its upper surface, with each value being equally likely. These tools were often used when a decision required to outsource human subjective elements into an objective environment.\n\nDivination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appears to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. If a distinction is to be made between divination and fortune-telling, divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a religious context, as seen in traditional African medicine. Divination has long been criticized. In the modern era, it has been dismissed by the scientific community and skeptics as being superstitious; experiments do not support the idea that divination techniques can actually predict the future more reliably or precisely than would be possible without it.\n\nThis idea is especially adaptable to the data driven belief systems of our time, where human decision making involves trust in omnipresent although obscure and biased artificial intelligence, esoteric pattern analysis, DIY heuristics, magic numbers among others. \n\nPress 'h' to switch between high/low resolution pixel density (set to low for mobiles)\n\nTouch to listen",

A syntactic sequence can provide meaning from the interaction between its elements. This sequence is symbolized by a series of shapes piled along a single axis. These shapes can either overlap by themselves, of through their respective spheres of infuence. As such, they collectively project a simple representation of what is at stake with syntactic relationships among lexical agents.\n\nThe \"meta\" aspect is intuitive: this work is an abstract representation of unidimensionality that yields a two-dimensional image computed from a three-dimensional paradigm.\n\nThe twist of Metasyntax is hence to be an abstract projection that is quite literally what it is.",

            "description": "## PROJECT DESCRIPTION\n\nWhat is it like to be a sea turtle in the age of plastic?\n\nOur global addiction to single-use plastic is destroying our marine environment. Over 11 million metric tons of waste plastic enter our oceans every year. Thankfully, there is a growing force of ocean defenders rising to combat this crisis. Activists and non-profit organizations around the world are working diligently to solve the ocean plastic problem — but they don’t have nearly enough resources to succeed. This project aims to help.\n\nTurtle Vision uses code, chaos, and regl.js to offer us a glimpse into the experience of a sea turtle in 2023, struggling to survive in an ailing ocean. Turtles prey heavily on jellyfish, but have trouble distinguishing them from the countless plastic bags clogging our oceans given their similar shapes and movement patterns. Because of this, we are finding more and more sea turtles dead on beaches, having starved to death with bellies full of plastic bags.\n\nWe believe that generative art can help to reverse this trend and restore sea turtle populations to pre-plastic levels. Turtle Vision aims to raise money for 5 Gyres, one of the foremost nonprofit groups in the war on single-use plastic. 5 Gyres has a storied pedigree in this space, and has also emerged as a leader amongst conservation organizations in its embrace of blockchain technology.\n\nThis project is a collaboration between renowned generative artist @s_r_r_z, the creator of the iconic Generative Octopuses, and @Casson.tez, a professional ocean conservation activist who works at the intersection of environmentalism and web3.\n\nWe are grateful for the support of Tender.art, fx(hash), TZAPAC, the Tezos Foundation, and the entire Tezos community.\n\n\n## EDITION\n\n- Series size: 534 (it's SEA)\n- Price: 111-99-77-55-33\n- Charity share: 40% of primaries, 5% of secondaries\n\n\n## TECHNICALS\n\nVisuals:\nThis artwork portrays jellyfish intermixed with litter in the ocean, such as plastic bags and masks.

            "description": "Monad 1960 is a collection of generative artworks created using JavaScript code, inspired by the generative art movement that emerged in the 1960s. Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of basic modules, or 'monads', that are combined and transformed through an algorithmic process to generate a unique generative artwork.\n\nIn philosophy, the term 'monad' was used by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz to describe the basic and indivisible unit of reality. In generative art, the term 'monad' refers to the simple elements that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create artworks.\n\nPioneers of generative art, such as Vera Molnar, Michael Noll, and John Whitney, experimented with the use of algorithms to generate artworks. These artists developed computer programs and mechanical systems that used simple patterns and shapes to create complex and dynamic artworks. In this context, 'monads' became the fundamental building blocks of these generative artworks.\n\nIn the Monad 1960 collection, programming and algorithmic design are used to generate unique artworks that reflect the principles of the generative art movement. Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of 'monads' that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create a unique generative artwork, exploring the relationship between the simplicity of the 'monads' and the complexity of the resulting generative artworks.\n\nFeatures:\n8 background colors.\n8 canvas sizes.\n45 types of number groups that create different paths for the algorithm.\n\nThe animation lasts 30 seconds, so I recommend waiting until it finishes before downloading the artwork.\nPress \"S\" to download the image.\n\nCreated by Fernando Cabral.",
