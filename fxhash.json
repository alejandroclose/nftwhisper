            "description": "Diamond Fractal Fire interposes recursively generated poetry with similarly recursive fractal imagery. Each text (unique for each mint, but always 20 sentences in length) is generated by a custom context-free grammar algorithm, fed with lists of words selected by the creator. The fractal pattern in each edition is a variation on a Koch snowflake fractal, one of the earliest fractals described by mathematicians. These fractals grow over time at varying rates, and pulse with varying color ranges using Perlin noise, eventually filling the screen.\n\n\nPush `h` to save high resolution PNG and JPG images of the complete fractal pattern (takes a moment to process)\nPush `s` to save PNG and JPG images of the current browser view (with current browser window dimensions and resolution)\nPush `v` to begin recording canvas as a video (with current browser window dimensions), then push `v` again to save the video\nPush `f` to toggle fullscreen mode\nPush `p` to toggle zoom pause\nPush `r` to toggle zoom reverse\nPush `c` to toggle color shift pause\nPush `l` to toggle low resolution mode (improves framerate)\n\n\nThe animation is somewhat computationally expensive, and so it runs best on contemporary laptop and desktop computers. Mobile devices and older computers may experience low frame rates. Captured video quality may vary depending on compute and browser limitations. The animation is responsive (it will adapt to any screen or window size), and resizing your browser window also will restart the animation.\n\nColor floors and variances represent ranges for Hue using a Hue/Saturation/Brightness (HSB) color model. Velocities represent (subtle) zoom speed differences. Noise increment and start values affect the rate and variation of color shifts.\n\nIn addition to the author's code, Diamond Fractal Fire relies on the p5.js library.",

And so, the context across this lo-fi place overlooks the diamond of that tear. Your neurotic sea accepts the fire that takes your realm that beckons furthermore. That place above their moment shrieks against that relentless love. But this road pulses. Any short rule reasons furthermore. This craft at that blistering siphon shrieks still. And so, that cracked void beckons. And that love that shrieks across any feel of any crash whispers. The context through this abandoned horizon advances. Meanwhile, any plateau over the touch that ceases already endures on my moment. And any plateau of that moment anyway sees that moment of this whir. Likewise, my person far overlooks their diamond to that arc that backward measures that day that goes forever.

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

            "description": "Recently, while scrolling through my Twitter feed, I came across something about the bicubic interpolation method, which reminded me of a funny joke my professor once shared during a lecture on numerical methods:\n\n\"Bicubic interpolation is like ordering pizza from four different kitchens at once and then making them agree on the recipe. Each slice ends up exactly how you want it, but it takes way more effort than just eating plain bread 😄\".\n\nThis algorithm truly tries to account for all surrounding points to achieve the smoothest, most natural result — a real perfectionist in the world of interpolation! This mention inspired me to revisit bicubic interpolation, but this time from an artist's perspective.\n\nBicubic interpolation is a method for interpolating data points on a two-dimensional grid. It creates smoother surfaces compared to bilinear or nearest-neighbor interpolation. While bilinear interpolation considers only 4 pixels (2×2), bicubic interpolation takes into account 16 pixels (4×4), which is why it’s computationally more demanding. Here I fill the canvas pixel by pixel, using only the bicubic interpolation method to achieve smooth color gradients. A bit of chaos is introduced to the overall composition through my custom metric for pixel placement.\n\nPress S or double-click to save as PNG.\n\nKyiv, 11.2024.",

            "description": "My 88-year old mother moved into a nursing home in Sept.  She had reached the point of needing 24-hour care both physically and mentally.  As her eldest child and only daughter, I was left to make the decision and it was a tortuous one.  I felt that I should care for her at home even though I knew that trying to do so would break me quite quickly.\n\nRecently, cleaning out her home in preparation for selling it, I found a cache of old documents - birth certificates, death certificates, marriage licenses, military records, etc.  I had needed to put my struggles into some cathartic exercise, and suddenly it dawned on me what I wanted to do.  I have scanned these old documents and cut glyphs from them to form a family of fonts.  I’ve then used these fonts to create Measure of a Life.\n\nIt seems only yesterday that I ran wild on the farm, my parents and grandparents a forcefield of security, and death something too abstract and distant to have any meaning.  Now I stand at the apex of my family, the bridge between the generations ranging behind me and those before me, my great-granddaughter now the feral child.  How do I feel about this position?  Everything and nothing, a chaos that can only be expressed somewhere beyond words. How does one measure a life - a few documents, a few photos, a plot in the cemetery, a great pang in the heart?\n\nThis work continues a pricing innovation I introduced with my first work of 2023, What If.  For the first week, collectors of my previous projects may collect the token for free.  At the beginning of the 2nd week, the remaining editions will be offered for sale to new collectors. At the beginning of the third week, the remaining editions will be burned. I intend to use this sales approach through June, 2023 while releasing at least one project per month. My goals are to 1)reduce my fretting about the sales and marketing aspects of my art, 2)reward my supporters, and 3)encourage livelier secondary trading of my work. \n\nThis piece uses custom fonts created by the artist as visual and symbolic components.  Being fonts, these are pre-rendered. All other components are algorithmic.\n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in Feb., 2023.\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution file suitable for printing.

            "description": "The <iframe> HTML element is an element that allows a web document to embed the contents of another web document within itself. iframes are at the core of fxhash. They are portals opening our view to rich content.\n\nThis work is a portal to itself. It loads itself within itself 20 times. It's not pretty, it reminds us of WordArt, it's a little bit hacky, it might break when our tools to display HTML will change. But it's a proof that the limits of our tools are only limits until creativity breaks them.\n\nThis work is not purely deterministic, because it simply cannot be. Slight timing differences due to loading times being different each time an <iframe> is loaded will make each visualization slightly unique.\n\nIf you view this token on mobile, the nesting limit was reduced to 4 to prevent performance issues.\n\nThis work is highly experimental. It leverages a \"hack\" to allow iframes to be nested.\nFirefox max <iframe> nesting depth as of 28/12/2021 is capped at 9.\nWorks with chrome desktop 96.0.4664.110",

J. T. Mitchell discusses the concept of \"digital imagery\" and references a mythological figure, Urizen, who appears in the works of William Blake. Mitchell states:\n\n\"Urizen represents measurement and division, drawing the circumference of the world and delineating the boundaries between light and darkness, serving as the sacred rational architect fundamental to the visible universe.\"\n— \" Image Science: Iconology, Visual Culture, and Media Aesthetics \" Chapter 11, by W. J. T. Mitchell.\n\nFrom William Blake's portrayal of Urizen, I sense a central figure in the creation of the world's myriad forms, one immersed in calculating the incalculable, measuring elusive patterns, and tracing the vortex of ever-flowing boundaries.\n\nIn my view, this represents the ongoing collaboration between humanity and computer today.\n\n▒\n\nIn mathematics, θ (theta) typically represents an angle on a plane. Through calculations involving points, lines, and angles (with the assistance of computers), we can create an almost infinite array of shapes. For me, at this level, θ has become a fundamental metaphor underlying the creation of digital imagery.\n\nIn this artwork 'θ', I attempt to connect the metaphorical aspects of mythology with mathematical calculations, imagining myself as a cartographer of creation, striving to capture the fissures in image generation.\n\nHowever, this also signifies that I cannot create anything outright; I am always an individual trying to master the elusive calculations. Only be continually captivated by the corporeal perception and temporal characteristics of digital imagery.\n\n▒\n\n[Key] commands\n\n〘P〙 - pause / continue drawing\n\n〘S〙 - save image // (keep Drawing)\n\n〘1〙〘2〙〘3〙〘4〙 - get higher res image // (Stop Drawing)\n〘2642x3852〙〘3303x4815〙〘3963x5778〙〘4624*6714〙\n\n▒\n\n[Note]\n\n-The display on mobile devices may vary slightly, and it is recommended to open live view on a computer for the best experience.",
