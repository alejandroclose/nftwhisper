            "description": "In creating this piece, I found myself drawn to the intersection where technology meets literature, a space where code and creativity become inseparable. It's a unique blend of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" and the unpredictable nature of AI-generated visuals.\n\nHuxley's dystopian vision always struck a chord with me, especially in today's rapidly advancing technological landscape. I saw parallels between his world and the way generative art evolves - both shaped by their environments, reflecting fears, hopes, and the inherent chaos of their times.\n\nBut what really fascinated me was how human touch still played a role. Much like the characters in \"Brave New World\" wrestling with destiny, the AI visuals in my work, though algorithmically birthed, were guided by my hand. They're not just a reflection of the text but a response to it, engaging in a dialogue that goes beyond mere replication.\n\nThis isn't just a generative token; it's a question, a conversation. It's my way of exploring where we stand at this crossroads of art, literature, and technology. In crafting this piece, I found myself wondering, what does our Brave New World look like? How do we balance the precision of code with the fluidity of human emotion? And in a world increasingly dictated by algorithms, where do we fit in?\n\nI invite you to join me in this exploration. Let's unravel the tapestry, decode the symbols, and discover what it means to be human in a world where art and AI coalesce.\n\n- Press \"T\" to save the text contained within the composition, derived from it´s specific chapter \n- Press \"S\" to save a .png of the composition",

            "description": "\"Layers of Noise\" is a generative art project, a collaboration between the digitally native artist Rafael Spiff and myself, Bruta currently in my creative-coding, digital abstract-expressionism form. The project focuses on the duality of our existence, typical of Rafael's explorations, while my beloved theme of perseverance and stoicism is emitted in the visual dichotomy of humanoid forms between static/stoic and chaotic elements.\n\nAs a collaborative empath you can see I have drawn from Rafael's visual style, but also I have to admit that another important influence is the pioneer of animated noise algorithms Kim Asendorf.\n\nThe \"Layers of Noise\" system goes beyond the mere complexity of algorithms and focuses on the expressive use of experimentation. It uses the usual suspects - elements of Random and Perlin noise, Clifford based flow fields and some basic Math. These mathematical underpinnings are then creatively shattered using the Canvas API in unprecedented and unconventional ways, resulting in analog-like glitches and captivating deformations.\n\nRafael's exploration of the tension between order and disorder in the human mind finds its perfect counterpart in the generative system's underlying theme of persistence and perseverance. The static humanoid shapes, meticulously crafted by Rafael, symbolize strength and determination, serving as anchors against the infinite layers of noise that pervade the artwork. This juxtaposition evokes a sense of wonder and contemplation, inviting viewers to delve into the intricate depths of the human experience.\n\n\"Layers of Noise\" pushes artistic expression forward, creating a collection of animated artworks that transcend traditional notions of plotting centered generative art into the more digitally native direction of glitch and gif mediums. Each piece is a vibrant manifestation of the human spirit, capturing the beauty, complexity, and resilience inherent in our existence.\n\n\n*In the creation of every output are used three static prerendered assets in the form of .png digital artworks crafted by Rafael Spiff. Every other color, shape, pattern, background animated or not is generated live by the generative system.\n\n*P5.js and Canvas API are mixed in the code.\n\nThe project is implementing fxhash features connected tightly with the visual output, having the craziest outputs being the most rare.\n\nProject is tested and on most popular desktop browsers for Windows.\n\nKeys:\n\n- Click over the screen for a little zoom in into the textures.\n- Press \"s\" for static image download.\n- Press \"g\" to download 3 sec animated .gif.\n- Press \"n\" to Stop/Start animation.\n\n\nThank you!",

            "description": "\"Layers of Noise\" is a generative art project, a collaboration between the digitally native artist Rafael Spiff and myself, Bruta currently in my creative-coding, digital abstract-expressionism form. The project focuses on the duality of our existence, typical of Rafael's explorations, while my beloved theme of perseverance and stoicism is emitted in the visual dichotomy of humanoid forms between static/stoic and chaotic elements.\n\nAs a collaborative empath you can see I have drawn from Rafael's visual style, but also I have to admit that another important influence is the pioneer of animated noise algorithms Kim Asendorf.\n\nThe \"Layers of Noise\" system goes beyond the mere complexity of algorithms and focuses on the expressive use of experimentation. It uses the usual suspects - elements of Random and Perlin noise, Clifford based flow fields and some basic Math. These mathematical underpinnings are then creatively shattered using the Canvas API in unprecedented and unconventional ways, resulting in analog-like glitches and captivating deformations.\n\nRafael's exploration of the tension between order and disorder in the human mind finds its perfect counterpart in the generative system's underlying theme of persistence and perseverance. The static humanoid shapes, meticulously crafted by Rafael, symbolize strength and determination, serving as anchors against the infinite layers of noise that pervade the artwork. This juxtaposition evokes a sense of wonder and contemplation, inviting viewers to delve into the intricate depths of the human experience.\n\n\"Layers of Noise\" pushes artistic expression forward, creating a collection of animated artworks that transcend traditional notions of plotting centered generative art into the more digitally native direction of glitch and gif mediums. Each piece is a vibrant manifestation of the human spirit, capturing the beauty, complexity, and resilience inherent in our existence.\n\n\n*In the creation of every output are used three static prerendered assets in the form of .png digital artworks crafted by Rafael Spiff. Every other color, shape, pattern, background animated or not is generated live by the generative system.\n\n*P5.js and Canvas API are mixed in the code.\n\nThe project is implementing fxhash features connected tightly with the visual output, having the craziest outputs being the most rare.\n\nProject is tested and on most popular desktop browsers for Windows.\n\nKeys:\n\n- Click over the screen for a little zoom in into the textures.\n- Press \"s\" for static image download.\n- Press \"g\" to download 3 sec animated .gif.\n- Press \"n\" to Stop/Start animation.\n\n\nThank you!",

            "description": "In creating this piece, I found myself drawn to the intersection where technology meets literature, a space where code and creativity become inseparable. It's a unique blend of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" and the unpredictable nature of AI-generated visuals.\n\nHuxley's dystopian vision always struck a chord with me, especially in today's rapidly advancing technological landscape. I saw parallels between his world and the way generative art evolves - both shaped by their environments, reflecting fears, hopes, and the inherent chaos of their times.\n\nBut what really fascinated me was how human touch still played a role. Much like the characters in \"Brave New World\" wrestling with destiny, the AI visuals in my work, though algorithmically birthed, were guided by my hand. They're not just a reflection of the text but a response to it, engaging in a dialogue that goes beyond mere replication.\n\nThis isn't just a generative token; it's a question, a conversation. It's my way of exploring where we stand at this crossroads of art, literature, and technology. In crafting this piece, I found myself wondering, what does our Brave New World look like? How do we balance the precision of code with the fluidity of human emotion? And in a world increasingly dictated by algorithms, where do we fit in?\n\nI invite you to join me in this exploration. Let's unravel the tapestry, decode the symbols, and discover what it means to be human in a world where art and AI coalesce.\n\n- Press \"T\" to save the text contained within the composition, derived from it´s specific chapter \n- Press \"S\" to save a .png of the composition",

            "description": "We look at things that are seemingly random and can't help but form relationships between them. For centuries people of many different nations and cultures have looked up to the skies and perceived patterns, objects, mythical creatures from scattered stars.\n\nThis work, initially titled 'Chaos', began as a study for my project 'Gestalt' to explore the idea of working with a foundation of hidden random points and connecting points with curves in interesting ways. Almost by accident I discovered a technique which ended up creating outputs resembling scenes from some otherworldly cosmos. While it produced some visually interesting outputs, they didn't quite fit the direction for 'Gestalt' and only a portion of the algorithm was used. \n\nThe study was recently revisited and further refined to explore something different to 'Gestalt' (yet would nod to it), blur the lines between abstraction and figuration, and lean into the atmospheric moodiness of that once accidental output. 'Constellations' plays with the concept of interconnectivity, the meeting and interacting of hidden elements, and the emergence of patterns and interpretations from chance encounters (or kismet).\n\n---\n\nReleased for VerticalCrypto Art invites | LONDON 2022.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• 'R' reassembles the piece\n• 'B' toggles the frame\n\nNote: Some mints may take time to fully render in live mode.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid",

            "description": "The algorithm to determine the shortest path between a set of points is a famous computer science problem, notoriously difficult, and known as the \"Traveling Salesman Problem\".\n\nThis piece is another entry in my study journal of algorithmic emergent systems, and is based on this famous problem. \n\nThis time, I used the following description:\n- Place N points randomly on the canvas, and assign a random direction to each point. \n- At each step, draw the shortest line that connects all the points, and move each point along its defined direction\n\nAs usual, each step is typically drawn with very low opacity, and is repeated hundreds of thousands of times. Eventually, the interaction between overlapping lines creates unexpected patterns and textures.\n\nThe recent introduction of the new fxparams system was a great opportunity to expose the inner workings of the algorithm and let collectors actively contribute to the final outputs. In my previous long form projects, parameters ranges were carefully limited to make sure all outputs were consistent. Here, exploration of extreme ranges is voluntarily left open, allowing collectors to come up with their own variations.\n\nWith this system, the collector becomes a critical part of the art creation process. In order to acknowledge that, 75% of the royalties will go to the minter.\n\nTo go with the spirit of this token, the total number of editions will also be an emergent property of the market: starting with a large supply of 10.000 editions, half the supply will be burned every Tuesday at noon EST, and the mint price will be increased by 1 tz.\n\nThis token uses the regl.js library. Higher resolution outputs can be generated by adding ?s=2 or ?s=3 to the live view URL. The 's' key will save the output as png.",

            "description": "In creating this piece, I found myself drawn to the intersection where technology meets literature, a space where code and creativity become inseparable. It's a unique blend of Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" and the unpredictable nature of AI-generated visuals.\n\nHuxley's dystopian vision always struck a chord with me, especially in today's rapidly advancing technological landscape. I saw parallels between his world and the way generative art evolves - both shaped by their environments, reflecting fears, hopes, and the inherent chaos of their times.\n\nBut what really fascinated me was how human touch still played a role. Much like the characters in \"Brave New World\" wrestling with destiny, the AI visuals in my work, though algorithmically birthed, were guided by my hand. They're not just a reflection of the text but a response to it, engaging in a dialogue that goes beyond mere replication.\n\nThis isn't just a generative token; it's a question, a conversation. It's my way of exploring where we stand at this crossroads of art, literature, and technology. In crafting this piece, I found myself wondering, what does our Brave New World look like? How do we balance the precision of code with the fluidity of human emotion? And in a world increasingly dictated by algorithms, where do we fit in?\n\nI invite you to join me in this exploration. Let's unravel the tapestry, decode the symbols, and discover what it means to be human in a world where art and AI coalesce.\n\n- Press \"T\" to save the text contained within the composition, derived from it´s specific chapter \n- Press \"S\" to save a .png of the composition",
