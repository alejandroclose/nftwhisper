It embodies a form of purity, an absence of experience that could have altered its original essence. In young adults or adults, especially in our productivity-focused societies, naivety is often seen as a weakness, a dysfunction, or even an exploitable incompetence, subject to mockery. As if the hardening process, deemed necessary to make an individual apt and conforming, had not operated satisfactorily.\n\nHowever, it is paradoxical to note that literature, as well as our personal experiences, are filled with examples where an adult's naivety is a strength, a means to overcome and transcend numerous obstacles. It's also a choice, conscious or unconscious, to apply a filter to the reality we observe and engage in.\n\nWith advanced age, there is often a return to this naivety, a rediscovery of that lost innocence. In the elderly, this quality becomes, in a way, normal and even desirable, especially when it doesn't stem from illnesses. It reflects a form of wisdom and resilience in the face of life's complexity, a way to lighten oneself before departure.\n\nStarted with doors attached to an unfinished perspective, this project became quite obsessive until revealing a meaning that I perceived as this introspection on naivety. Between art therapy and personal reflection, this work is a journey in which I visually experimented with some of my convictions that I, along the way, deconstructed.\n\nTo materialize this reflection, I designed a simple drawing, naively representing a set of celestial bodies and birds through cognitive doors. These doors, fixed on a stable structure without alteration, rest on a uniform background with a slight grain.\n\nFrom this original view, I then revisited each element, altering them individually before recombining them. Constructing a background of simple objects, books, and childish patterns. I added a ground and clouds to anchor this confrontation to the terrestrial. The doors combine, opening to a broader vision while reducing the number of viewpoints. The structure is distorted, dissonant, resonant, colorful, sometimes overly so, even amplified, mirroring our personal structures constantly changing and confronted by life. The doors merge, increasing the surfaces and reducing the viewpoints. The birds have changed, the celestial bodies have moved, becoming denser, taking up more space, colliding, and tearing apart. Transparency emerged, allowing a glimpse of the entirety through our own doors. The reflections of different plans connect.\n\nFrom anarchic coloring, the lines are immature, the encounters are random. This choice reflects again the desire to preserve the dissonance induced by certain encounters and the space they occupy in our internal mechanics.\n\nThis approach produced an image oscillating between disharmony and interest; sometimes pleasant, sometimes less so, even hostile or incomprehensible.\n\nThis project, in its execution, is entirely random. It was created using the p5.js, p5.noise, and chroma.js libraries.\n\nThe \"S\" key saves the three created images.",

It starts with triangles and lines and results in a diverse array of formations.\n\nIn 'Apertum', you will find a series of transformations and reshuffles, as well as a vibrant mix of textures and patterns. These interactions give rise to intricate compositions that I hope you'll enjoy discovering.\n\n'Apertum' is both a thank you to those who have supported my work so far and an invitation to those new to my creations.

Made on graph paper highlighting the technical nature of the basic design. The grid creates mathematical order and clear structure, providing a stable foundation for artistic exploration.\n\nWithin some of the squares, the shapes intertwine and overlap, giving life to the geometric vision. Triangles stand out in different directions, some dotted with circles of various diameters, while rectangles of different sizes make up intriguing compositions. The colors used are black/white and a random colour, which catch the eye and create a lively contrast.\n\nthe work challenges the viewer to perceive art even in fields usually related to mathematics and engineering. The work invites reflection on the nature of order and creativity, showing how structure and artistic freedom can coexist in harmony. the work celebrates the beauty of geometric shapes and their versatility, demonstrating that even a technical foundation can be the starting point for a unique aesthetic experience.\n\n100% code - p5.js\n\nPress left mouse button to choose density from 1 to 15 (9000x12000) (wrong results set to 1)\n\nKenzo da barra",

            "description": "The idea of designing an urban facade came to my mind in 2019, but it was postponed for various reasons. A few months ago I refocused on this project and after reviewing the available examples I decided to use a specific style to implement it.\nThis algorithm depicts an isometric view of a city. Therefore, the basis of this algorithm is isometric design.\nIsometric drawing comes from the Greek \"iso metro,\" meaning equal measure. This is because the angle between the x, y, and z axes is 120°. It's a form of axonometric perspective (there is no foreshortening). In other words, face lines are all drawn from the same angle.\nThe advantage of drawing this way is that an object can be freely rotated, re-positioned, and reoriented without redrawing it. There is also no change in scale when an object is moved forward or backward.\nOne of the features of using this style is that with a suitable combination of colors at different angles, you can quickly achieve 3D output with a 2D design.\nEach building is individually designed after determining its height with a random algorithm, then one of dozens of random roof design algorithms is called for finalization.\nTwo types of scale combinations have been used for building scale, one is buildings with the same scale. In this combination, large-scale structures are formed when buildings are placed next to each other. And in other compositions, the integration of different scales creates more depth and variety.\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "Mei(梅):\n\n\"Mei\" is an oriental art piece featuring the imagery of plum blossom, a symbol of courage and perseverance in traditional Chinese culture.\n\nThe generative system at the backend of \"Mei\" is an exploration of this cultural symbol by modern art language. The basic elements of the paintings are merely circles and enclosed flow field shapes. A great variety of short and light strokes of such elements are used across the paintings. Xuan paper is occasionally used as background, which is a painting material since the Tang dynasty.\n\nMei's outputs span different stages of plum blossom from winter to spring. The scene also changes from a calm day to snowy or even stormy weather. The consistent yet complex senses and feelings reflected are surprisingly versatile.",

We're here for our families, our friends, and our community. Like everything in life, there are joyful times and challenging times. We must accept happiness as something that is not constant but that we feel at times (a \"tratti\" in Italian).\n\nWith \"tratti\", we want to send a message to every disheartened human being: \"Stay strong and never let anyone or anything crush the hope in you.

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",
