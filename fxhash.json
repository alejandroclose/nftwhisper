            "description": "Mountains throughout human history have taken on deep meanings. Coated with immense sacredness by all peoples in the most different places. Being them as a representation of God himself or being the object of worship. For many the mountains were the very abode of the Gods. They are in the collective unconscious as the ability to connect men and gods, through the flow of energy between earth and heaven.\n\nThe symbology is very strong. It unconsciously reminds us of the process of encounter between the loneliness of the earth and the hope of the sky, between the fog that blinds and the cloud that supports, between the abyss of the ground and the proximity of the stars. All this is very charming and fascinating.\n\nAll human beings have their own mountain, which demands from each one their limits to reach the top, the desire for the breathtaking view, the fear of falling, but also the hope of the last step at the highest point.\n\nIn generative art it couldn't be different, going through all the learning, from its fundamentals, to all the countless hours of tests, to countless moments of problem solving and research and more research. This whole process is without a doubt like climbing a mountain. Thinking about the project is exactly like looking at a mountain and imagining how exhausting it will be all the way to conquer it. Finishing your work is like breathing a sigh of relief, looking down and seeing how hard it was to get there, but at the same time looking ahead and realizing how rewarding it was to be able to have that vision and breathe the refreshing breeze of the moment.\n\nAfter going through a transformation in my first work, where I transmuted my artistic essence from illustration to generative art. Now I come to this second work that I delved into, and after months of climbing this mountain of mine, I give it to you.\n\n\n- Press \"S\" in live view mode after loading to save at 1600x1600px.\n\nlicense: \nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nproject website:\nhttps://playman.me/projectmountain\n",

            "description": "\"Garden, Monoliths\" is the result of an algorithm that started in April 2021. It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",
