            "description": "and other astounding TRUE stories\n\nA piece about sensationalism, which can be fun when satirical, absurd or surreal, but also has become a real problem in the news and the web, with rampant click baits, fake news and the constant need for clicks, orchestrated by unfeeling sorting algorithms and AIs.\n\nSaturated colors, high contrasts and energy for a generator that produces multi-scale Truchet-like tiles in various patterns meant to evoke some kind of alien or ancient typography, based code I originally wrote for Genuary 2024 day 20 : Generative Typography ( https://ulucode.com/genuary24/20/ )\n\nThe generator can take up to a minute to produce the artwork depending or your CPU, so please be patient.\n\n!!! Be sure the check the menu that you can find by click/tap the BUTTON in the TOP LEFT !!!\n\nIn this menu you'll find some options to customize your experience (frame toggle, anti-aliasing, aspect ratio), and some option to explore the composition yourself by unlocking the camera. While the artwork is primarily static 2D, it's also fully real time 3D. This mode is recommended for people with a decent GPU or a recent mobile phone.\n\n!!! TO EXPORT CLEAN HIGH RESOLUTION CAPTURES, click the \"EXPORTS\" button in the menu, select your desired resolution then click the \"START CAPTURE\" button. This only works when the generator is running in its own window, so be sure to click the \"OPEN\" button.\n\nBest performances/experience on desktop in Chrome.\nUI uses the font Red Hat Display (OFL)\nEverything else is code.\n\n--------------\n2024 - Christophe Ulu Choffel\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0\nSee LICENSE.txt for full details",

            "description": "Our realities appear as a layering of moments, emotions, and choices that accumulate through space and time. These experiences pile up to form the foundation for everything to come, shaping our perspectives and influencing our sense of self, character, and worldview.\n\n'Pile' embraces the infinite possibilities of generative art to represent the rich, complex, and cumulative nature of life's experiences through the passage of time. Each moment builds on top of previous memories, where the present is always the sharpest, yet is soon obscured by what follows. Just as the imprint of past experiences can linger in our lives, the influences of older layers can still be seen in each piece, imbuing each composition with a depth and variety that is indicative of life's many histories. Composed of these textured and stacked layers, ‘Pile’ forms a dense and organic heap that embodies the controlled chaos of life's multitudes.\n\nResponses to our experiences tend to oscillate between thoughtfully pragmatic and mechanical means – and more sensitive, organic, and even passionate approaches. They’re a blur of exactitude and wildness, entropy and growth, a range of experiences and outcomes that vary so greatly that only by changing our perspectives and taking a step back can we see the commonality between each of our piles of life’s moments. The result is a visual representation of the cumulative nature of life's experiences, where forgotten moments and cherished memories are piled high with abandon, yet worthy of celebration.\n\nInspired by the works of artists such as Jackson Pollock and Joan Mitchell, 'Pile' invites us to contemplate the rich and multifaceted nature of life, and to celebrate the distinctive stories that each of us carries within. Through its vivid abstraction of life's controlled chaos, and the tension between organic lines and overtly digital marks, 'pile' beckons us to consider the intricacies of our own layered identities and to revel in the diversity of life.\n\ncreated in p5.js.\n\n_________________________\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press ‘p’ to save png\n- Press ‘1’ - ‘9’ to run a high resolution file (higher resolution files will take longer to load)\n",

            "description": "At the heart of our interconnected lives, \"Mahsus\" emerges as a reflection on the subtle yet profound ways in which intimacy and touch manifest within the digital sphere. This project captures the essence of those fleeting moments where the physical and emotional intertwine, reminiscent of a whispered affection or the gentlest of contacts that leave behind a trace of warmth and closeness.\n\nDrawing from a rich palette of shared experiences that shape our identities and our relationships with the world, \"Mahsus\" invites its audience to delve into the sensations of touch—those that are premeditated and bear an intimate, personal signature. Through this exploration, the work contemplates how such interactions, though often absent in digital exchanges, remain pivotal in our understanding and experience of connection.\n\nBy reimagining the tactile within a digital context, the project offers a meditative space for viewers to engage with the notion of digital intimacy encouraging a contemplation on the ways digital and physical realms can converge, evoking the genuine feeling of being touched, both physically and emotionally.\n\nIn this endeavor, \"Mahsus\" seeks to underscore the emotional and intimate facets of human interaction. It stands as an invitation to experience, to feel, and to reflect on the intricate dance of human connection in our increasingly digital world.\n\n\"Mahsus\" while phonetically reminiscent of the Arabic \"محسوس\" -meaning \"felt\" or \"sensed\"- derives its meaning in Turkish from the Arabic \"مخصوص,\" denoting something specifically intended. This nuanced lineage enriches the project's thematic exploration of deliberate, sensory connection across cultural boundaries.\n\n------\nIn live mode:\n- Press \"S\" to save in PNG format.\n- Press \"P\" to generate higher resolution image (2880x5120 px).\n------\nMade with p5.js\n------\n© 2024 Bassil Taleb.

            "description": "'Tesseract' is a generative collection drawing on the concept of the cube from oneirology, the interpretation of dreams. In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

            "description": "FSM is a visual grid-system based on autopoiesis, the principle of self-organization through self-reproduction central to cybernetics. At the heart of FSM is a computational mechanism, a finite-state machine (FSM), which generates sequences of visual outputs by activating particular agents and cycling them through varying sets of configurations.\n\nThe grid-system in FSM is segmented along three axes: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. This segmentation constitutes the machine’s parametric space.\n\nCertain agents and configurations are programmed to appear exclusively in specific grid segments, illustrating a principle of spatial distribution.\n\nSimilarly, spatial distribution is mirrored by temporal distribution. Specific agents and configurations are set to emerge at predetermined time intervals. This interplay turns FSM in a self-organizing system living on the blockchain.\n\nThe underlying grid of the animation is responsive. Try to change your window size to get different aspect ratios and grid configurations. On the project page you'll find a tool to adjust some parameters via queries components.\nPlease visit: http://fsm.julian-h.de for more information\n\nCONTROLS\n[f] To enter fullscreen mode\n[spacebar] Play or pause the animation\n[s] Export current frame as a PNG\n[g] Capture a small GIF\n[G] Press once to start capturing a GIF and press [G] again to stop the capture process.\n\nCreated using p5.js and GLSL.\n\nJulian Hespenheide, 2023",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

It's free because it has some errors I couldn't fix in how the tiles line up with each other, plus it's not all that artistic in my opinion.

This garden has been grown by collecting, curating and nurturing algorithmic specimens that inhabit a space both cellular and planetary. A symphony of particle forces orchestrates the form and interaction of the simulation, tuned to cosmological constants by the artist.\n\n49 kB of compiled JavaScript. Code written 100% from scratch with no dependencies. Mouse interactive.\n",
