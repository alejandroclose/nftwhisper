This is not intended as a fleeting show of generic support.  It’s a personal challenge.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to elevate the artist named in your edition. Here is how it works.  Collect an edition and watch your new piece of art build.  Open it in live mode and press R.  The name of an artist will appear.  This the artist you are asked to elevate.  The artist names are from the two lists found on fxfeed.xyz: “women in genart” & “lgbtqia2s+ in genart” (see full list below).  The names themselves are fx(hash) user names, facilitating easy location of their work.\n\nHow do you elevate? Here are some ideas:\n. Explore the artist’s work, commit their name to memory, and watch for opportunities to support them\n. Follow the artist on fxfeed and social media\n. Post about and engage in discussions about the artist’s work on social media\n. Take every opportunity to ask that the artist be included in events, panel discussions, podcasts, curated exhibits, newsletters, etc.\n. Collect the artist’s work if you have the means\n. List the work you’ve collected and help build the secondary market for the artist\n. Explore fx(elevate) editions collected by others, commit the names of those artists to memory, elevate them, repeat.\n\nIf we draw attention to, and train our influence on, these important members of the fx(family), we will be the change!\n\nThe other major feature of the work is the palette.

            "description": "fx(elevate) is a cry for parity within our community for underrepresented groups. It is released in conjunction with fx(fam) 003, our third community town hall.  Like all my 2023 releases, previous collectors of my work may collect it for free. In fact, anyone may collect it for free.  But, there is a catch.  This is not intended as a fleeting show of generic support.  It’s a personal challenge.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to elevate the artist named in your edition. Here is how it works.  Collect an edition and watch your new piece of art build.  Open it in live mode and press R.  The name of an artist will appear.  This the artist you are asked to elevate.  The artist names are from the two lists found on fxfeed.xyz: “women in genart” & “lgbtqia2s+ in genart” (see full list below).  The names themselves are fx(hash) user names, facilitating easy location of their work.\n\nHow do you elevate? Here are some ideas:\n. Explore the artist’s work, commit their name to memory, and watch for opportunities to support them\n. Follow the artist on fxfeed and social media\n. Post about and engage in discussions about the artist’s work on social media\n. Take every opportunity to ask that the artist be included in events, panel discussions, podcasts, curated exhibits, newsletters, etc.\n. Collect the artist’s work if you have the means\n. List the work you’ve collected and help build the secondary market for the artist\n. Explore fx(elevate) editions collected by others, commit the names of those artists to memory, elevate them, repeat.\n\nIf we draw attention to, and train our influence on, these important members of the fx(family), we will be the change!\n\nThe other major feature of the work is the palette.  There are twelve choices, exposed as a feature, and each one is associated with an aspirational characteristic of our community.  You can take up the challenge of emphasizing this characteristic in yet another way of elevating our shared goal.\n\nThis work could not have been completed without the support of the fx team and two wonderful members of our fx(hash) community, cari ann shim sham* and louis. My undying love and respect always. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in April, 2023.\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [R] in live mode to reveal the name of an artist to elevate.\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution file suitable for printing. It can take a bit - please be patient.\n\nArtists:\n0rfula, Ada Ada Ada, Aeon Bloom, Aleksandra, AliaK, Ally, Alyssa Joines, Amanda Homem, Amber Vittoria, Amelia, Amy Goodchild, Ana Maria Caballero, Anna Lucia, Anna Carreras, aster1ai, Atelie 407.genart, aether, auniseiva, AutoEclectus, AydaEtb, Babara Ramos, Bandana, candevicmo, cari ann shim sham*, Casekimba, Cathy Burghi, catnips, Ce Vignolo, ChistAi, Ciput_GENART, crystalspaceshp, danielleking.tez, daratan, DehiscenceArt, DesignwithSarah, Devi Parikh, Dora Vlady, drawsbymv, Eliza SJ, ella, Elout de Kok, elsif, Emily Xie, Empress Trash, Estelle Flores, ExperiMentalnoise, Fabi Yamada, Faze, flight404, goldcat, Gyo, Henames.art, INA VARE, innadakota, IskraVelitchkova, Iteration__, Ivona Tau, jeres, jesshewitt, Jimena Buena Vida, Jojo Sunshine, Jolie Michel, jsliang, Julia V, krolcm, Kunio Okuizumi, Kusamehewa, la.agust, LadyTezos, levoontin.tez, Liam Egan, liasomething, linxirwengi, Lisa Orth, Lisa Sekaida, m5alien, mandybrigwell, mare-mon, Mariana JU, Medusa Iro, Melissa Wiederrecht, Minever, MinooK, nx0, Nadieh, Natalie.J, Negarnaderifard, NftEconomist, Nicole Vella, orbitanaut, Pixantle, QianqianYe, RalenArc, reona396, Reva, Rezva, sapirco, Sarah Ridgley, Sasha Stiles, se.nao.maja, Selisse, senbaku, sharla, Sollevera, sonylemon.tez, speginel, Stefj, SuLuLab, TAN-TAN, thesarahshow, trp_chai, Tyche, UBERMORGEN, V5MT, Victoria Crux, VidaV, violetforest, vocesferales, Wanda Oliver, Willow Pines, WizArtOfTez, Yasmin Senzi, Ziggo511.",

            "description": "After 4 months of coding the Generative Glasses is ready! I gained a lot of experience along the way and I really liked the creation process.\n\nI wrote an article in which I report on the creation process in more detail. It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\n👓 thousands of different outputs are possible\n👨‍💻 only code\n🎨 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \n🎥 animated\n🖱️ interactive (+controls for mobile)\n😎 augmented reality view\n🟥 different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\n🖼️ save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\n📼 save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress “5” to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress “6” to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress “7” to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress “8” to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress “ArrowDown” for restores the original camera view\nPress “D” to switch to next composition\nPress “A” to switch  to previous composition\nPress “S” to start animation\nPress “Spacebar” to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress “1” to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress “2” to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress “3” to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention! Thanks for the support! Thanks for the opportunity fxhash and genart community! I hope I was able to contribute to generative art with my work!\n\n@C4RC0\ncarco.hu",
