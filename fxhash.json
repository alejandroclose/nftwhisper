            "description": "Absurd is the first piece of the “Propositum” series.\n\nOur existence by itself is absurd. Are we a mere accident, created by the forces of nature, or are we hand-crafted by god himself? If we are a coincidence, the chances of humanity happening are absurdly minuscule. If we were hand-crafted by God, then how could it be possible that God is eternal, yet he was incarnated as the finite, human Jesus? That doesn’t make sense.\n\nWhy are we here? Well… We don’t know. And if you think about it, why should we? And why do we even need a purpose? Isn’t just existing enough to satisfy us? Humanity’s search for a meaning is plainly absurd, because it is simply undiscoverable. \nSisyphus can be considered the embodiment of the human struggle against the absurd. He is condemned to push a boulder up a hill every day, for eternity. He, and us, must struggle with the meaninglessness of our existance, without any real hope of succeeding.\n\nBut what if we don’t consider purposeness as something negative? What if we just enjoy our lives, with the full knowledge that they have no meaning whatsoever?\n\n“One must imagine Sisyphus happy” - Albert Camus.\n\n\n\nSketch written in pure JS.",

            "description": "In the dreamlike landscape of our minds, the specter of fears is like a wraith, ever-present and ethereal. It whispers in our ear, reminding us of all the things we dare not face. It is a shadow that falls across our hearts, casting a pall of doubt and uncertainty. But even as it haunts us, we must remember that it is a part of us. We must learn to accept its presence, and to use it to our advantage. For fear is not always a curse, it is a guide that shows us where we must grow stronger. It is a companion that walks with us through the dark night, illuminating the path ahead. By embracing our fears, we find the courage to face them, and to overcome them. We find the strength to live fully, to love fiercely, and to pursue our dreams with abandon.\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nSpecter of Fears by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2023\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

Perfect example for emergence, how simple even byte-size rules result in complex structures, forming patterns and unpredictable behaviors...\n\nThis one is simple, 1d elementary cellular automata and the 256 rules as the foundation, where each iteration consists of the following elements: base rules - 3 are selected and allocated into the start row compositions, a set of shapes is assigned to a grid of various sizes. Occasionally, dynamic rule set is added - where a rule is randomly transformed into another random rule on a random row of the grid. A vertical or horizontal alignment of the grid is chosen an a color set assigned. Sometimes, a simple 2d noise is applied to lighten (or well, darken) things a bit. The grid is finite and confined by the amount of cells in a row and amount of rows fitting the canvas given cell size.\n\nThe properties are recorded as features, more as a reference to the building blocks, rather then rarity indication. Probably be best viewed in live mode :)\n\nPressing 's' in live mode will save the png of the output.",

            "description": "Borders Revisited is an all-code rework of the image-comp project ‘borders’, a randomly arranged drawing project that used hand-drawn layers and a popular PNG template. \n\nBorders Revisited is created entirely with code in p5js.\n\nThis project attempts to recreate some of the previous projects artwork, while adding more randomness and generative elements throughout. \n\nThe results are a playful interplay between borders. Random elements line up and clash to create energetic compositions.",

The project begins by studying the use of grids and how they can be used to create structure and balance in a composition. Next, the use of cubes will be examined, and how they can be used to add depth and dimension to a composition. Finally, the project will delve into the use of patterns and how they can be used to create movement and interest within a composition.",

            "description": "In the dreamlike landscape of our minds, the specter of fears is like a wraith, ever-present and ethereal. It whispers in our ear, reminding us of all the things we dare not face. It is a shadow that falls across our hearts, casting a pall of doubt and uncertainty. But even as it haunts us, we must remember that it is a part of us. We must learn to accept its presence, and to use it to our advantage. For fear is not always a curse, it is a guide that shows us where we must grow stronger. It is a companion that walks with us through the dark night, illuminating the path ahead. By embracing our fears, we find the courage to face them, and to overcome them. We find the strength to live fully, to love fiercely, and to pursue our dreams with abandon.\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nSpecter of Fears by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2023\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "SCHNEEWALD is the second release in a row of about 12 tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years.\n\nThis project explores an approach to trees with snow using a recursive algorithm and includes Three traits: a density layer for the amount of trees and another layer for the amount snow and a third for how strong the branches bend.\n\nRendering progress indicated on the top left border\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png\n\nArtist notes:\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nI experienced it in all sorts of seasonal change, packed with snow is definitely among the most amazing! \n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: https://e-art.co/project/schneewald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND",

            "description": "'Here When You Need Me' is a generative system that creates...\n\nGood question, and I think the answer is up to you. Jewels? Reflections? The Sand in a Life's Hourglass?\n\nWho knows. The truth is that I didn't have anything in mind for the project, and where it has ended up was purely through exploration, and a refinement of simple methods.\n\nBy the end, it has become exactly what I needed it to be, and the results of this project give me an encouragement that is difficult to explain.\n\nNow, one of the primary features of the project is your ability to make it what you need. Several URL arguments are explained below that will allow you to tweak your edition's distortion and resolution.\n\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Girls Who Code'\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n\n10% of royalties will go to 'Girls Who Code'\n10% of royalties will go to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n10% of royalties will go to the original minter\n\nThank you everyone.\n\n\nOptions\n-------\nParameters can be appended to the live URL to adjust the output's distortion, resolution, border size, and border color. These are all fun to play with, and can be used in combination to showcase the variability and potential of each piece.\n\n'&distortion=#': Adjust distortion, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 to see a 'flat' version of the image)\n'&resolution=#': Multiplier for width/height, any value from 0.1 to 6.0 (Soft max of 3.9)\n'&borderSize=#': Multiplier for border size, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 for no border)\n'&borderColor=ffffff': Custom border color, any 6 character hex code (Do not include '#')\n\nAn example of using multiple options would be '&resolution=2&distortion=.5'\n\nPlease check the linked fx(text) article for detailed examples on using these options.\n\n\nDistortion\n----------\nI wanted to provide some amount of control to take advantage of the possibilities of generative art. 'Here When You Need Me' starts off at a certain point, but allows you to adjust the distortion to your favorite level.\n\nUsing '&distortion=0' will show the underlying shapes.\n\n\nResolution / Printing\n---------------------\n'Here When You Need Me' looks best with at least '&resolution=2' and is designed to support printing. Remember that parameters can be provided to adjust the border attributes as well.\n\nIdeally, you should aim for 300 'pixels per inch' for a decent quality print. Default resolution is 1800x2400.\n\n'&resolution=1' -> 6\"x8\"\n'&resolution=2' -> 12\"x16\"\n\nSome quick math will give you the correct modifier if you start with the width in inches of your desired print. \n\n(inches) * (ppi) / (default width)\n\nAn important note, the maximum resolution modifier I've had success with is 3.9 because of the browser's image size limitations, but the capability is still in the code to go higher in case it is helpful to someone.\n\nIf you have your edition printed, please share with me because it would make me incredibly happy to see it!\n\n\n---------\nThank you to everyone for your support and contributions. \n\nI put way more detail in this description than I intended, but if you want even more, you can read about the development and potential of this project in the accompanying fx(text) article, once it is written.\n\nCreated by Walter Anderson (@noxiarb)",
