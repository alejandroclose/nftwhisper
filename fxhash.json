It means that the world around us is a reflection of our inner world, and vice versa. Also implies that the universe is a harmonious whole that everything is interconnected.\n\nI use circle, dashed line and transparent filling as a base form to construct a framework that generates images which attempt to represent the mind and thoughts of this verse.\n\nThe \"BaseCircle\" Feature means that how many circle was used as a starting point to expand to the whole canvas. Those rules construct different forms in visuals of harmony . Hope you like the abstract and the concrete of this work.\n\nDone by P5js.

            "description": "How and How Not To Maintain Friendships charts the ways that relationships between people can develop or dissipate over time. Starting from different places, and different degrees of distance or closeness, friendships evolve over time. Sometimes we grow closer to others, sometimes we grow apart. Sometimes this happens quickly, and other times it is slow. Sometimes we become so enmeshed in our friends’s lives that our paths twist together, interlocking and criss-crossing in a shared journey. Other times we may follow mostly parallel paths with a handful of others, some of whom may head off on their own paths at different points down the line. Each of us influences the many people around us in different ways. Like masses suspended in space, friendship works like gravity on the people close to us, sometimes bringing us closer together and sometimes sending us whirling off in new directions.\n\n2022 by LIA (www.liaworks.com)\n\nToken-holder's usage rights:\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

The tip of the triangle is the uterus which makes the space grow.\n-- LIA DREI (Diaries, 2004)\n\nMy paintings have no past, they are empty of meaning in the present, but await the discussions of the future, as remotely as possible.\nAnd this is why they don't have their feet firmly planted in the ground, although there are invisible roots that take life from the earth, like so many blades of grass.\nWhile I work I look for the truth in what I do. The time is not yesterday because it would be false, it is not today because the emotion takes my breath away and I die every moment and am reborn after every new brushstroke.\nSoon after, time becomes old, useless, meaningless. I never know what will come out with the next brushstroke or spatula stroke.\nMy thoughts go at supersonic speed and only stop to choose another color. The one just painted is never the right one. So I live the life of the new painting with the sense of mystery that the moonless night has. (…)\n-- LIA DREI (Notes, 1962)\n\n----\n\nI never talk about myself.\n\nI'm not creative.\nI blatantly steal other people's art.\nI'm a bad coder, I copy, paste, mix ideas.\nI often ruin it, degrade it.\nBut I always make it mine what I like.\n\nI absorb.\n\n-- ALESSANDRO FIORE (fxhash, 2024)\n\n\n—————\n\nThe work is created responsive by default and it will adapt to the browser window.

            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives.
