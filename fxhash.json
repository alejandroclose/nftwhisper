It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane.

Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging.

It represents the generative processes driving fxhash tokens. Generative Tokens are fed with a unique hash to produce unique outputs based on the hash — they are functions with a hash as single input.\n\nThe growth that comes out of the text is driven by a \"Dividing-Aggregating Walkers\" (DAW) algorithm. The hash drives all the DAW settings, as well as a mutation factor which is responsible for changes in each Walker parameters as they divide.\n\nSome iterations will produce very simple outputs whereas others might be more chaotic.\n\nPiece by @ciphrd for fxhash",

Each token features a generative system\nwhich tries to achieve such a cognitive stimulus to elicit Pareidolia or\nclustering illusions.\n\nThe underlying algorithm uses an autonomous agent to create initial paint\nstrokes.

            "description": "The Last Days of Fire and Steel uses a stippling, pointillist technique to build up an image over three hundred and sixty frames of animation, pushing approximately half-a-million dots to the canvas in that time. Each point's position, size, opacity and hue is controlled by the algorithm, shaped by the manipulation and constraint of random numbers.\n\nFive noise fields are selected, their density and influence on the final piece chosen from carefully-curated ranges. Structures, lighting, sky events and foreground structures are also generated using random values.\n\nSky\n\nThe main render—the overwhelming majority of the pointillist dots—can be weighted in numerous directions, lighting the sky to the left, right or perhaps centrally. Clouds are formed from the other four noise fields, which are rendered in smaller, tighter groups.\n\nWater\n\nThe bottom half of the picture is dedicated to a body of water, usually in the same main colour as the sky. Dot-size and density are altered towards the bottom of the piece, providing a slight feel of perspective. Additionally, dimming effects are overlaid near to the centre of the piece to subtly enhance the feeling of depth.\n\nStructures\n\nThe buildings—which include cuboids, spires, girders and domes—are shifted slightly over time to allow their edges to blur. Sometimes they are rotated slightly, sometimes the girders will feature small, pinpoint lights that activate towards the end of the render. Very rarely the landscape will be flat and featureless: all buildings gone. There's also a rare chance of a blurred foreground overlay of twisted girders, crooked fence posts or metal posts.\n\nSky Events\n\nComets, missiles, or falling satellites: whatever they are, they descend over the render, shifting slightly under the influence of gravity. Dark streaks may also traverse the sky: a seeking craft, perhaps, or something more sinister. They advance towards a central point. There is a rare chance of a meteor burst or what must be some kind of scramble: up to eight aircraft speeding to a common destination.\nStars, explosions, supernovae or distant moons illuminate the sky, sometimes as an inverted, dense point of light, other times as a halo of frosty moonglow. A rare chance of a full-spectrum rainbow star is there.\n\nSound\n\nIn a first for a Mandy Brigwell artwork, I've included a soundtrack for this piece. A moody, ambient layering of analogue synth and percussion can be activated by the viewer, enhancing the experience of the artwork. Sound must be activated by the user: press [I] for details.\n\nPost-Render Effects\n\nThe render is complete after three hundred and sixty frames, but some render effects continue for a further two thousand or so frames, gently fading away to nothing. This prevents a sudden completion of the work, and is included with display in mind.\n\nInteractivity\n\nPress [I] for details. Double-click to go fullscreen.",

            "description": "Adjacent is the third in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art. This piece focuses on the study of Diagonal White, a series he developed between 1970 and 1975.\n\nIn 1976, Ruth Leavitt published a collection of papers titled \"Artist & Computer\", which highlighted the 35 prominent generative artists and asked them to discuss their work. They were posed questions like, \"Do you feel art work created with a computer has now or will have an impact on art as a whole in the future?\". Edward Zajec was a subject of one of those papers and in it detailed the approach to Diagonal White. \n\nThe original program was run on a CDC 6200 computer at The Univeresiry of Trieste. The programming was done in collaboration with Dr. Matjaz Hmeljak, his long-time technical partner. Inspired by his collaborative relationship, Adjacent the output of a partnership between Christine Hall and Chris Maddern.\n\nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to save a high-resolution version of the image\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nBy @christine_hall and @chrismaddern",

            "description": "Subtraction\n\nRun the NFT and then click anywhere on it to play the chord (sound). Please note that on iOS the sound playback might not work if the device is in mute mode.\n\n\"Subtraction\" is a text-score from the book \"ImageAudio: A Post-Digital Event Score Anthology\" by Zach Dawson (22.02.24). This NFT my realisation and interpretation of \"Subtraction”. Each iteration triggers an editor, allowing users to set parameters like the number of notes in a chord, the duration of the longest note, and the frequency range between notes. Each iteration creates one chord.\n\nYou are invited to mint as many chords as you want, with each new chord building on the previous ones to form a continuous piece of music. Consider the parameters of previous chords when creating your iteration. In the future, I plan to release a webpage that collects metadata on this NFT’s minted parameters and plays back the entire composition, making the minters of this NFT co-composers of the musical work.\n\nSubtraction (text-score by Zach Dawson):\n\n“Programme a dense chord.\nEach pitch within the chord should end\nat different times over a short duration.\nGradually crush the sound to 8-bit over\nthe decided duration.”\n\nImageAudio book: https://archive.org/details/imageaudio-book/mode/2up\n\nIn the code, the chance for a chord to crush the sound to 8-bit is 1 in 5.\n\n—\n\nCredits:\nMusic, visuals, and composition coded by Adam Łukawski (sunsetsobserver).\nCommissioned by Zach Dawson, author of the ImageAudio project.\n\nLibraries used:\nTone.js (MIT License)\nJZZ.js (MIT License)\nJZZ-MIDI-SMF.js (MIT License)\nHtml-midi-player (BSD 2-Clause License)\nFxHash (MIT License)\n\n—\n\nFind more of my projects at:\nwww.adamlukawski.com",

It starts by making a simple drawing, then the shader uses noise to warp the image.  I'm making it free because 1) You really have to work at it to make art (but I think it's a lot of fun to tinker with!), and 2) the capture sometimes has minor variances from the final image - couldn't figure it out.  Made with p5js and uses some Perlin noise code by Inigo Quilez.  \n\nAfter opening, press \"s\" to save a large jpg.",

            "description": "Each monogrid artwork gets initialized with a start up algorithm that builds up a set of rectangles and fills them with pixels. There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",
