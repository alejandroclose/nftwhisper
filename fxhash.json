            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "\"Garden, Monoliths\" is the result of an algorithm that started in April 2021. It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

Perfect example for emergence, how simple even byte-size rules result in complex structures, forming patterns and unpredictable behaviors...\n\nThis one is simple, 1d elementary cellular automata and the 256 rules as the foundation, where each iteration consists of the following elements: base rules - 3 are selected and allocated into the start row compositions, a set of shapes is assigned to a grid of various sizes. Occasionally, dynamic rule set is added - where a rule is randomly transformed into another random rule on a random row of the grid. A vertical or horizontal alignment of the grid is chosen an a color set assigned. Sometimes, a simple 2d noise is applied to lighten (or well, darken) things a bit. The grid is finite and confined by the amount of cells in a row and amount of rows fitting the canvas given cell size.\n\nThe properties are recorded as features, more as a reference to the building blocks, rather then rarity indication. Probably be best viewed in live mode :)\n\nPressing 's' in live mode will save the png of the output.",

Ghostly plants and flowers grow around an invisible point, but they immediately begin to fade into the dark background and are soon replaced and covered by others. This process of accumulation and disappearance builds an ever-changing floral garland, or perhaps a funeral wreath.\n\nThe monochrome vegetation is part of a fictional flora, born out of random algorithmic combinations, and does not intend to reproduce any real species. It belongs to an “artificial nature” which, like so many worlds that the computers generate for us in movies, games, and virtual reality environments, is a convincing simulation of life, but it is not actually living. AI bots, virtual assistants and non-player characters are also representatives of the uncanny realm of the not-really-alive-but-looking-like-it, which are becoming an increasingly relevant presence in our everyday lives.\n\nThese plants and flowers speak about life as a process of incessant renovation, but also about death as the background that’s always there and makes life possible. This spectral vegetation seems to thrive precisely at the verge between both worlds.\n_______________\n\n\nThis work is animated and will adapt to any screen size. It generates a never-ending ring of algorithmic foliage, which never repeats itself, and is different for each token. The image preview is triggered after the first five plants or flowers.\nMade with p5.js\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture",

            "description": "Thousands of particles are spread around a group of curves, the general shape of these curves is decided by the hash, but you can influence other things.\n\nThis is an interactive and animated piece. You can use the mouse and scroll-wheel on desktop, or touch controls on mobile, to shift the camera around. Because the wrap effect is happening in the screen space not in the world space, you might notice the wrapping makes rotating the scene a little unusual.\n\nSome notes on the parameters:\n\n- The location of a particle can be \"wrapped around\" in space. The wrapping can be either horizontal or vertical (random), or both (Double wrap checkbox), and you can change the ranges of the wrapping behavior. The Wrap factor param mixes between the original position and the wrapped one.\n- The curves can either be a straight line from A to B, or a Bezier curve, the param Line factor decides how much of each.\n- Particle spread factor decides how far from the curve the particles can be spread.\n- The curves rotate, each at a different speed. You can influence the overall speed multiplier and the axis of rotation.\n- If you choose a palette, be aware of the shuffle checkbox. With shuffle turned on any one of the palette colors can be the background, and the rest is for the particles.\n- Be careful with the number of particles per curve and the total number of curves. More particles overall means some devices might have a harder time rendering this smoothly.\n- Different browser and hardware combinations seem to behave slightly different when it comes to the particle size. If Safari is your main browser, be careful with particle sizes below 20, they seem (almost) invisible!\n\n\nMade using Three.js and Liam Egan's fxhash-helpers.

            "description": "===== A Simple Test =====\n\nThis project started as a harmless way to test mint outputs with varying aspect ratios in preparation for an upcoming project that I've spend several months on which will be called A Simple Fail and will be released on my main fxhash account: https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/bfos.art\n\n<Read more about A Simple Fail @ https://www.bfos.art/projects/a-simple-fail>\n\nI quickly realized how much I would love to collect these mints. So why not set this up as a derivative project at a friendly discount on my alt account?  While I have made tweaks from the base code for this project, I have not spent the extremely detailed amount of time as I have on A Simple Fail.  There will be outputs that will have muted color compositions.  Many will love these minimal outputs.  But, if you hate one of these special mints, just let me know and I'll be happy to purchase the token back from you within reason and for a limited time.\n\nI'm not publishing this project with an intention of burning down from the initial mint number.  This isn't a project to get rich on.  I only hope that it is one that you and the community will find great delight in collecting!  \n\nPlease have fun with A Simple Test!\n\nI will publish this project as disabled so I can test a few outputs.  If all goes well, I'll schedule the project for opening on a later date.\n\n\n===== Interactions =====\n\n{A}dapt to screen size\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{G}rain switch\n{H}ighlight switch\n{Z}oom switch\n{1-6} Save at x multiple of screen size",

            "description": "[ CLICK TO START THE SOUND ]\n\nOften, I find myself feeling like I'm running behind, or that time is slipping away too quickly. I struggle to be present in the moment because of anxieties related to the past or the future.\n\n\"On Time\" explores the elusive nature of time and my relationship with it. Through this project, I aimed to create an experience that captures the way that we each experience time in our own way. Seeing that time is not linear but instead, it ebbs and flows in different ways.\n\nAt the heart of the experience is a visual reminder to stay in the moment and embrace it. The project consists of 256 unique visuals, each one representing a fleeting moment that has been captured in digital form. These moments are presented in a way that allows you to observe them, appreciate them, and stay present in them. \"On Time\" is an invitation to pause, take a deep breath, and remind ourselves that we are always where we need to be.\n\nControls\n[ f ] - fullscreen\n[ s ] - save the current frame as an image\n\nCreated with Three.js\nCopyright (c) Dec. 2022 - Feb. 2023 Shaderism",
