And while we devise systems for solving unfathomably complex problems, generating algorithmic creativity, and unlocking regenerative biological possibilities, we simultaneously cling to the power and originality of emotional feeling – believing it to be the irreplaceable source of what makes us human.\n\nIf the body is our shell for emotion and soul, can an artificial humanoid be another vessel for these thoughts and feelings – for human essence itself? If our ‘soul’ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable? That we may see answers to these questions looks more real every year, and is perhaps a little frightening. \n\nEmotional Shell uses introspective portraits of future selves to question what it means to be human, when the people around us are no longer human.\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 1-3 to select from low, medium, and high quality settings\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2400px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nTENDER x wwatkns\nAugust 2022",

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

However, I've developed a new small bit of code I am testing here; I am trying to create a \"clumping\" noise function that looks natural but doesn't have the obvious \"look\" of Perlin noise, and is more controllable. This piece contains my first public use of this. So it is, in a way, a test. \n\nI was inspired by the IRL paintings of Francesco D'Adamo, specifically his \"Manifesti\" series, although (as is the way of things) the end result looks nothing like what I started with, and is a more general 1950s abstract expressionism look. \n\nThis piece is a gift to the collectors of all my recent \"a\" mints.

However, I've developed a new small bit of code I am testing here; I am trying to create a \"clumping\" noise function that looks natural but doesn't have the obvious \"look\" of Perlin noise, and is more controllable. This piece contains my first public use of this. So it is, in a way, a test. \n\nI was inspired by the IRL paintings of Francesco D'Adamo, specifically his \"Manifesti\" series, although (as is the way of things) the end result looks nothing like what I started with, and is a more general 1950s abstract expressionism look. \n\nThis piece is a gift to the collectors of all my recent \"a\" mints.

            "description": "A study of building and destroying. I built this. You may knock it over.\n\nHumans are both creators and destroyers. One of the earliest games children learn to play is building with blocks, then knocking them down. This simple activity is teaching kids about gravity, cause and effect, and imposing their will on the world around them. As children grow older, the gap between these opposing actions widens. The intention behind knocking things down becomes less innocent, and creators aren't as excited to see their work destroyed.\n\nIn 1915, the Russian avant-garde founded the abstract art movement known as Constructivism, rejecting everything except for the absolute purest aspects of form and material. This art was used in service of the Russian revolution and utilized heavily in its propaganda, intended to highlight the utilitarian nature of industrial progress. Mainly, building the new Russia. Its influence is lasting, and can be seen throughout art and design trends even today.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, footage of missiles and airstrikes decimating Ukrainian buildings permeated the media. Ukrainian lives, kitchens, windowsill gardens, and family photos tumbled to the ground. Like children's blocks. Things that took a lifetime to build were destroyed in seconds. \n\nKONSTRUKTS represents this duality in creation and destruction. Stacked children's blocks are rendered in the style of Constructivist designs like El Lissitzky's Proun series, and Alexander Rodchenko's posters. With a simple tap, blocks (or buildings) can be knocked to the ground.\n\n- Tap anywhere to reveal the KONSTRUKTS menu in the top left. Tap the menu for several options.\n- KONSTRUKTS can be exported as USDZ or GLTF models to be used in augmented reality or the metaverse.\n- Export a full resolution PNG image from the menu.\n- If you knocked over the blocks, you can reset them from the menu.\n\nKONSTRUKTS is built entirely with code, using Three.js, JavaScript, and GLSL.",

            "description": "A study of building and destroying. I built this. You may knock it over.\n\nHumans are both creators and destroyers. One of the earliest games children learn to play is building with blocks, then knocking them down. This simple activity is teaching kids about gravity, cause and effect, and imposing their will on the world around them. As children grow older, the gap between these opposing actions widens. The intention behind knocking things down becomes less innocent, and creators aren't as excited to see their work destroyed.\n\nIn 1915, the Russian avant-garde founded the abstract art movement known as Constructivism, rejecting everything except for the absolute purest aspects of form and material. This art was used in service of the Russian revolution and utilized heavily in its propaganda, intended to highlight the utilitarian nature of industrial progress. Mainly, building the new Russia. Its influence is lasting, and can be seen throughout art and design trends even today.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, footage of missiles and airstrikes decimating Ukrainian buildings permeated the media. Ukrainian lives, kitchens, windowsill gardens, and family photos tumbled to the ground. Like children's blocks. Things that took a lifetime to build were destroyed in seconds. \n\nKONSTRUKTS represents this duality in creation and destruction. Stacked children's blocks are rendered in the style of Constructivist designs like El Lissitzky's Proun series, and Alexander Rodchenko's posters. With a simple tap, blocks (or buildings) can be knocked to the ground.\n\n- Tap anywhere to reveal the KONSTRUKTS menu in the top left. Tap the menu for several options.\n- KONSTRUKTS can be exported as USDZ or GLTF models to be used in augmented reality or the metaverse.\n- Export a full resolution PNG image from the menu.\n- If you knocked over the blocks, you can reset them from the menu.\n\nKONSTRUKTS is built entirely with code, using Three.js, JavaScript, and GLSL.",
