            "description": "With 'Curtains,' I wanted to explore the concept of dying civilizations on distant worlds. Using p5js, I create collage-like images that resemble abandoned cityscapes on alien planets. The project is named 'Curtains' as it represents the final curtain call for these once-thriving societies. Through the use of painterly effects, I aimed to depict a sense of decay and loss in these apocalyptic landscapes while also leaving room for interpretation and imagination. \n\nThe project serves as a reminder of our own fragility as a civilization and raises questions about the fate of our planet and our future. Some may see it as a cautionary tale about the dangers of complacency and environmental neglect, while others may see it as a reflection on the cyclical nature of life and the inevitability of change.\n\nOptions:\n\n- press 's' to save the PNG image of the current view\n- press 'd' to save a high-resolution PNG image (can be slow üê¢)\n\nCreated using p5.js\nsteppe_walker, January 2023",

At the same time, as humanity as a collective is making some progress towards the exploration of outer space. However, the question \"Are we all alone?\" is still unanswered!\n\nFermi Paradox came from the speculative idea of the UFO phenomenon being some sort of galactic watchers sent by aliens to keep tabs on other intelligent life forms. This is a generative art project representing the watchers and the spaces being watched.\n\nThis project takes forward the idea of a digital diorama inspired by holographic dreams of our collective past, putting the viewers in place of the aliens, gazing upon different planets as the watchers go out exploring the universe.\n\n- 16 Terrains/Landscapes\n- 6 UFO Variations\n- 1000 color variations\n- Alien Day and Night Cycles\n\nAll generated with code via the webgl platform cables.gl.\n\n!!Might be a bit heavy on your system!!\n- Hold 'P' to check performance\n- Click 'S' to save a screenshot",

Within these ancient relics, primitive geometric shapes abound, alongside inscriptions in an enigmatic script. Yet, it is the presence of recursive substructures that confounds researchers, their origins steeped in the  mystery of time. The identity of these ancient architects remains elusive.",

            "description": "Timeless... a word that makes time indescribable. I want to talk about that point in space and time that seems endless, where past, present, and future are intertwined. In a space where endless time and rivers flow, without beginning and without end, always flowing and at the same moment, not recorded and not forgotten. In the period when the earth speaks of itself with a call of love and passion in every moment of life. When the heart sinks into the past, each emotion has its people. Here, feelings, thoughts, and ideas shine in an endless beam of time, each drop of which has a deep immersion in the vast sea of the past and experiences. A place where borders are erased and people connect with the earth. That bright spot in time and place reminds us that we are all part of a bigger story. Events that are connected from beginning to end are always ongoing and have eternity and beauty. From thousands of years ago until today, nature has shown endless displays of its special beauty. I want to talk about its sedimentary textures and its various colors, signs of an infinite path of time, and natural changes that have affected it, and each piece of it tells a mysterious story of its journey through time; From its formation in the depths of the seas and rivers to the emergence on the surface of the earth. A natural miracle, which, with its beauty, draws us to a world of greatness and wonder. Grooves that scream from the depths of time remind us that everything in this world is an infinite and beautiful journey, and we are part of this great world.\nPerhaps it is a symbol of beauty and stability in the stone world. Wonders that tell us about the distant past. It begins when the universe began to form and continues to this day. This geological formation, which was formed millions of years ago, is a masterpiece of earth maps that takes us to distant, complicated, and adventurous times. Textures of sedimentary rocks that preserve their beauty and special patterns tell a story of the journey of nature's superpower. Thin layers of blue, green, and red stones, make a valuable past for us; From water currents, solar eclipses, and deep underground fun.\nAnd finally, I conclude that the earth is an infinite museum of beauty and history. Each layer of this formation tells us a new chapter of the greatness of the world. A story that continues to this day and always fascinates us by watching his works.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

Some iterations eventually stop, some continue indefinitely.\n\nThe fun is that the project is implemented on a fragment shader. There is no array of grains of sand. Each pixel decides whether a grain of sand from a neighboring pixel will end up in it or not. This logic required a lot of banging my head against the wall, because the slightest mistake caused sand to disappear into nowhere or appear out of nothing and clutter up the entire space.\n\n0‚Ä¶9 ‚Äî set speed\nspace ‚Äî pause\ns ‚Äî save picture\ndrag over ‚Äî add more sand\nshift+drag ‚Äî erase",

I also added some texturing to give it a bit of Oompf.\n\nHope you like it!",
