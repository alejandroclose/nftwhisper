            "description": "\"In the year of 3023 the planet Earth from which all humans descend, today is called 'EARTH01', it is so called because it was the first planet to be completely destroyed by humanity. During the last few years of this planet's existence, the human race used all its resources to find new habitable planets and ways to reach them.\n\nAfter long years of tireless research, they began to discover new places where they could survive and explore, and thus they migrated from planet to planet and formed human colonies for thousands of years. Then one day some of them arrived on a new planet to begin their colonization, in this place they found trees very similar to the ones they knew, through ancient records of their ancestors, to have existed on EARTH01.\n\nBut unlike the trees on EARTH01, these were gigantic and instead of just fruit, some species also produced many types of important resources for human survival, such as water (extracted from some types of fruit), and even precious ores similar to of your home planet. To grow and survive, trees needed nothing more than a specific light from that solar system, which was very plentiful on that planet. These trees were then named 'Bellatrix', which in Latin (an almost lost language of EARTH01) meant 'warrior'.\n\nWith this discovery they thought had in their hands an infinite power, and so they began the same cycle done on all other planets, sucking all possible resources without thinking about the possibility of them having an end.\nAfter a few hundred years the planet began to crumble due to exploitation, and all the chaos caused by humans due to their greed and selfishness turned against them. Few Bellatrixes were left alive, the few existing rivers on the planet dried up, the woods and forests before full of life and those wonderful trees, no longer existed...\n\nSociety was in decline, laws no longer had effect on this civilization, there were groups of marauders, living there was no longer something safe. That planet full of life was now a desert planet, surrounded by sand dunes that swallowed the ruins of ancient buildings.\nIt was then that people realized that the same mistake had been made for all these thousands of years, generation after generation, no matter how fertile the new planet was, humanity always managed to deplete it and its resources. But it was too late, this civilization no longer had enough resources for them to leave this planet.\n\nWith that, a movement began for the preservation of these trees and the creation of complexes where people and Bellatrixes could live in safety, away from looters and other dangers now common in this place. The complexes were formed by units, which were raised many meters high to hinder the action of invaders, they were like small and large cities, but now far from the ground. These units were supported by small central columns, the more units and Bellatrixes in the complex, the more powerful and populous it was.\n\nAnd that's how they lived for many years, in these complexes there were rules and each one had their own specific ones, and they worked autonomously. Utilizing the resources obtained through the Bellatrixes and finally understanding their importance, they were able to keep the population alive and continue their civilization.\"\n\nThis is a record found in the diary of an unidentified space traveler and the only existing record of civilization on this planet.\n\n------------------------------------\nAbout the work:\nThis work was built entirely with code using only math, logic and 2D shapes to create light, shadow and perspective.\n\n------------------------------------\nFeatures:\n\"Palette\": 23 Palettes\n\"Units\": 1 > 45\n\"Bellatrixes\": 0 > 135\n\"Resource level\": Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High\n\"Population\": Very Small, Small, Medium, High, Very High\n\"Clouds\": True, False\n\"Sun/Moon\": Sun, Moon, False\n\n------------------------------------\nConstrols in live mode:\nOn desktop: Press 's' or 'S' to save as PNG (2534x3596)\nOn mobile: Touch the screen to save as PNG (2534x3596)\n\nArtwork created with p5.js and love.\nFebruary-March 2023",

Then one day some of them arrived on a new planet to begin their colonization, in this place they found trees very similar to the ones they knew, through ancient records of their ancestors, to have existed on EARTH01.\n\nBut unlike the trees on EARTH01, these were gigantic and instead of just fruit, some species also produced many types of important resources for human survival, such as water (extracted from some types of fruit), and even precious ores similar to of your home planet. To grow and survive, trees needed nothing more than a specific light from that solar system, which was very plentiful on that planet. These trees were then named 'Bellatrix', which in Latin (an almost lost language of EARTH01) meant 'warrior'.\n\nWith this discovery they thought had in their hands an infinite power, and so they began the same cycle done on all other planets, sucking all possible resources without thinking about the possibility of them having an end.\nAfter a few hundred years the planet began to crumble due to exploitation, and all the chaos caused by humans due to their greed and selfishness turned against them.

            "description": "There is something almost subversive about generative art that mimics nature. Rather than excelling at abstract mathematical beauty, it tries to hold the complexity and elegance of the natural world, all while attempting to be interesting art. This makes it a different kind of challenge than the mathematical attractors and flow fields that are common across generative art.\n\nIt may be ironic then that the solution to natural forms is very often mathematical. The trees in this work are built recursively as a graph, much like how one could build a fractal. But chaos is mixed in at each step to allow the shapes to vary, and reduce their self-similarity. This is a different approach to L-systems but the results are very similar.\n\nIn this token, there are:\n - Three styles of tree.\n - Twelve colour schemes (six day, six night)\n - Four shapes for leaves.\n - Five leaf patterns\n - And other entropy that cannot be enumerated.",

            "description": "The second piece in this series is dedicated to another fundamental algorithm in computer graphics: Voronoi. It's origin precedes its use with computers by several decades, or centuries, depending on who to credit, since science always is a continuum. In the generative art & design field, the algorithm has been an instrumental tool for generation(s) of practioners, sadly often to the point of turning clich√©.\n\nIn this piece I've attempted to \"break\" the classic resulting aesthetics of this algorithm and focus more on revealing its inner workings. There are many ways of computing a Voronoi diagram. The so called Jump Flood Algorithm (JFA) proved to be the visually most interesting approach to me. Again, as with the previous De/Frag piece, here the algorithm has been slowed down, timesliced and customized in dozens of ways to result in a more painterly character overall and produce a variety of new shapes & textures.\n\nFullscreen compatible (Press 'S' to toggle square frame).
