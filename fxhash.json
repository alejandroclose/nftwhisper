            "description": "…[O]ne of the earliest [applications] of dither came in World War II. Airplane bombers used mechanical computers to perform navigation and bomb trajectory calculations. Curiously, these computers (boxes filled with hundreds of gears and cogs) performed more accurately when flying on board the aircraft, and less well on ground. Engineers realized that the vibration from the aircraft reduced the error from sticky moving parts. Instead of moving in short jerks, they moved more continuously. Small vibrating motors were built into the computers, and their vibration was called dither from the Middle English verb \"didderen,\" meaning \"to tremble.\" Today, when you tap a mechanical meter to increase its accuracy, you are applying dither, and modern dictionaries define dither as a highly nervous, confused, or agitated state. In minute quantities, dither successfully makes a digitization system a little more analog in the good sense of the word.\n\n— Ken Pohlmann, Principles of Digital Audio\n\nIn this collection of mine, I focused on textures created repeatedly by dither, ASCII, and glitch effects in a random flow. The random pauses in the flow and the subsequent motion wiping each texture and recreating it result in a unique animation.\n\n*Dither Texture: Mouse Move\n*Horizontal Stretch: Left Click\n*Vertical Stretch: Right Click\n*Start and stop animation: press ‘P’\n*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as a PNG.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\ndiT͟Hər(ism) © 2023 by NUBPLUS is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n",

            "description": "### OVERVIEW ###\nThis project revisits some of the foundational ideas in my previous work \"Above (The Infinite)\" and makes them available in a parameterized form for your exploration.\n\nThis project both rewards and requires exploration. I intentionally left the parameter space very broad so that edge case configurations would be possible. In practice this means that additional curation beyond the initial random parameters will very likely be required, in a way that mimics my day to day experience as a generative artist.\n\nThanks to Karsten Schmidt for his excellent thi.ng libraries (https://thi.ng/), which form the technical foundation upon which this work was built.\n\n### CONTROLS ###\ne - Save the current frame as a PNG\nspace - Pause/Resume animation\n\n### PARAMETERS ###\nNOTE: Some combinations of parameters will cause flashing/strobing, which is why I have attached the \"Epileptic Seizure\" label to the project.\n\n* Color Palette: The color palette to apply to the output.\n* Merge Technique: The method used to combine the different patterns.\n* Patterns: The various patterns that can be combined to form the overall resulting tiled pattern.\n* Pattern Scales: The scales used to combine patterns. Higher scale values provide more visible pattern repetition.\n* Deformers: An optional additional spatial deformation of a pattern.\n* Deformer Scales: The scale of the deformation itself. Lower values use less of the deformation space, while higher values include more.\n* Detail: Acts as a filter on the visual complexity of the overall tiled pattern. Lower values will reduce visual complexity, while higher values will increase it.\n* Rotation Rate/Scroll Rates: How fast should the image rotate or scroll. Note: adjusting these parameters may result in visuals that trigger motion sickness.\n* Zoom: Lower values zoom in, higher values zoom out.\n* Round Scales Up?: When checked the pattern scales are rounded up to the nearest integer.\n* Animate?: Should some parameters be adjusted with the passing of time?\n* Low Res?: When checked, force device pixel density to 1, which reduces strain on the GPU, but may result in graphical artifacts. I usually keep this unchecked unless I want to lighten the load on the GPU.\n* Anti-alias?: When checked each pixel will be sampled multiple times to attempt to smooth out possible aliasing. This will put more load on the GPU, and will typically be slower. Can be useful when \"Low Res?\" is enabled.\n\n### HOWTO ###\nHere's how I find interesting things.\n\nFirst, I lock all of the parameters below \"Pattern 3\" at their default values. I will also usually lock both Deformers to \"Empty\", as they can sometimes hide interesting patterns while exploring, and then I experiment with enabling one or both once I have found something interesting.\n\nYou can also explore the options individually (to a certain degree) by setting other patterns to \"Empty\". This can make how patterns affect one another more obvious when you set them.\n\nAt this point I'll randomize the parameters, and then do one of the following:\n\n- If I see something that's extremely noisy/detailed, I'll turn down the \"Detail\" level, which can sometimes smooth things out.\n\n- If a tiling is very tight, I'll lower the \"Zoom\" to see more of the pattern, or the reverse if I want to see more overview.\n\n- If there's still a lot of aliasing/noise in the image, sometimes enabling anti-aliasing will help, but that will affect performance. I usually try to adjust the Scale/Detail/Zoom before resorting to anti-aliasing.\n\n- Interesting patterns are formed by the scale factors controlling how pattern overlap happens. Sometimes enabling \"Round Scales Up?\" will introduce some appealing visual symmetry.\n\n- Enable one or both of the deformers to see what impact they have on the pattern.\n\nFinally, once I've found a pattern that's interesting, I may enable scrolling or rotation. Note that enabling additional movement can increase graphical aliasing, so anti-aliasing may be required depending on the pattern.\n\nI hope you enjoy the exploration process!\n\n- Jeff Palmer\n",

Butchers selling pork sausages, praise the product, the cavalry officer hand to hoop the woman selling kipper fish. In front of the barber house, the money changers, all the Athenian jaws around their table are talking, and Socrates passes from the agora. Everyone knows him\".\n Andre Boonard\n\nMy starting point in this collection is to make the audience feel a connection with an architectural composition I aimed. That's why firstly I created a composition, has a 360-degree view in the square of an ancient city. There are rules of the physical world; I designed it with elements such as atmosphere and movement, far-near relationship, texture. I aimed to strengthen the depth by using obelisks, stone walls, arches and icons from ancient objects in space composition.\n\nIt was published in my detailed article about this collection.\n\n* Each composition has its own unique 360-degree view.\nYou can activate the 360 ​​view by pressing the “Q” key.\n\n* 2d and 3d images of each composition have rain feature.\nYou can activate the rain mode by pressing the \"E\" key.\n\n* Save image: press 'W' to save the current image as png.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n* 15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.\n\n* According to my period, the owners of “Stratification of the Orthogonal”, “Agora of Timeless” and incoming project will have free mint rights of the next project.\n",

            "description": "This token was created for THE PASSAGE: Pitch Drop experience, an interactive minting experience where your choices determine the design of your token. \n\nTo take part, please purchase an Edition 5 Coin on fx(hash) by HERE & NOW. The artwork and experience draw inspiration from the 'The Pitch Drop Experiment': the world's longest-running laboratory experiment. Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\n____\n\n\nWhile we wait for the 10th drop of pitch to fall in the famous Pitch Drop experiment, I couldn’t avoid thinking about time and change, capturing and preserving a moment of time, the history of art and science, and how we participate in the manipulation of the time itself.  \n\nThe history of new media art is deeply linked to technical developments in photography and its creative applications. With still and moving images, artists were introduced to a new way of visualizing time. Through the use of time lapses, long exposures, slowing down, and fast forwarding, time was manipulated, captured, rearranged, and modified in numerous ways.\n  \nThe French philosopher Henri Bergson believed that reality was in flux and that \"the essence of time is that it goes by.\" His thoughts about time and metaphysics had a significant impact on artists working in all media at the turn of the 20th century. Although he believed in pure perception unaided by machines, and looked down on the introduction of technology into the arts, for artists, who had always been fascinated with the body in space and time, he became their muse. Even before the widespread adoption of technological advances in artistic practices, painters were incorporating aspects of \"movement of time\" into their works (e.g., futurists, Giacomo Balla, but also Marcel Duchamp ). \n\nAnother influential figure for artists was Eadweard Muybridge. In 1878 he photographed a racehorse at full speed, becoming the first to capture what looked like the actual, discrete sequence of motion. After devising the system of several cameras (12 for the first sequence he made), set in a row and arranged to go off in a sequence (with shutters released by pulled strings), he became fascinated with “secrets of time, secrets locked inside basic human movements – a leap, a splash, a walk […]”*. \n\nAll of this inspired me to create and capture algorithmically generated shapes, and record their subtle changes through time and space in the style of vintage scientific illustrations, film strips, long-exposure photos, and comic book panels. Each frame inside this view is one fraction of a second later than the previous one, and the whole frame view is slightly shifted. Your actions inside of the Passage will influence everything, from the number of rows and columns inside of the grid to the color palettes, shapes, and sizes of the objects.\n\n_____\n* Jad Abumrad (host) & Rebecca Solnet (author) say this when they talk about Muybridge in the episode Time, on the Radiolab podcast, aired Aug 24, 2010 (https://radiolab.org/episodes/91584-time)\n",

            "description": "“Raoul Pictor cherche son style…” (Raoul Pictor is looking for his style…) was launched in Saint-Gall, Switzerland, in 1993. It consists of a Mac LC computer, a 12-inch color screen, and an HP 500C printer.\nThe program presents an animation in which we can observe an artist, Raoul Pictor, working in his studio. He paints, paces while deep in thought, consults books from his library, plays the piano, and enjoys red wine. The sequence of these activities is non-linear. The canvas is seen from behind, resting on the easel in the center of the room. We are unable to see what is being painted. Once his painting is complete, he picks it up and exits through a side door. It is at this moment that the printer springs into action, delivering his unique, dated, and signed work.\nThis project has been exhibited in numerous exhibitions around the world. Subsequently, a Flash version, \"Raoul Pictor Web Studio,\" was developed to make it available on the internet (2001). In 2013, for its 20th anniversary, an iOS version, \"Raoul Pictor Mega Painter,\" was developed in collaboration with the great Matthieu Cherubini (mchrbn.net). \nIn 2023, for its 30th anniversary, an update seemed necessary to continue the adventure on the fx(hash) platform – thank you for making all of this possible! The development of this first fx version (“Country Spirit I”) was greatly enhanced by the wonderful support and expertise of the sha22.art team as well as our friends. Additional collections are now planned for the near future or special events...\n\n[up_arrow], [space bar] : Painter jumps in first part of animation.\n\n[p], [mouse click], [touch screen] : Save the painting when it is displayed.",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",
