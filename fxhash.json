Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey! \n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you‚Äôve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n‚Äî\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n‚Äî\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n‚Ä¢ https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n‚Äî\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others‚Äô skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci √† tous!

            "description": "GuilCity is the beginning of an exciting journey bringing Guillaume Cornet‚Äôs densely-packed cities into the generative realm with the help of Matthew‚Äôs (@frostbitten‚Äôs) magic touch.\n\nMatthew‚Äîwith his background in coding and animation‚Äîenables a new opportunity to experience these cities like never before. Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey! \n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you‚Äôve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n‚Äî\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n‚Äî\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n‚Ä¢ https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n‚Äî\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others‚Äô skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci √† tous! Cheers!\n  - Guillaume Cornet, Matthew Seremet",

What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n‚Äî\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n‚Äî\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n‚Ä¢ https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n‚Äî\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others‚Äô skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci √† tous! Cheers!\n  - Guillaume Cornet, Matthew Seremet",

            "description": "Everyone remembers what they were doing when they first heard about it. I was trying to scrape peanut butter from the bottom of the jar with a knife. School bell rings at 4, I‚Äôm usually home by 4:12, it must have been 4:17 when I heard the news. The kitchen radio is always on. They interrupted the song and told everyone to stop what they were doing and to look up.\n\nI looked up and saw the kitchen‚Äôs ceiling. Then I heard people shouting outside and I saw it through the window. The grid. White lines in the sky. Impossibly tall. Impossibly light. Impossibly bright. I ran upstairs to my room. I opened the door wide and climbed on the roof through the window. It made the sun look so small. I climbed down. I changed into my evening clothes and closed the door of the cupboard. It‚Äôs important to close the cupboard otherwise it blocks my room‚Äôs door and you can‚Äôt open it from the outside anymore.\n\nIt's been three weeks now. It‚Äôs been both a very short time and an eternity. Everyone keeps talking about it. Everyone has a theory about it. Self-proclaimed specialists yield more and more explanations. Everyone thinks they‚Äôre right, thinks that they know what the grid means, that they broke the cypher. I have a theory too. I didn‚Äôt tell anyone. I wrote it on a notebook that I keep in my desk, opposite the cupboard. I have to close the cupboard otherwise it blocks my room‚Äôs door and you can‚Äôt open it from the outside anymore.\n\nMy theory is that there is no meaning to the grid. It‚Äôs there as a distraction. While we‚Äôre thinking about it, we forget about the rest. They made the grid to fascinate us while they were spreading. They‚Äôre making progress and we still haven‚Äôt realized it. To be honest, I‚Äôm surprised their plan works so well. A grid, whatever kind of grid it is, is a very low effort form of visual representation. And still, people are fascinated. This is the only thing they talk about. It shines brighter than the moon during the night. It‚Äôs everywhere. The only place where I can‚Äôt see it‚Äôs light is in my cupboard. I should not forget to close the cupboard otherwise it blocks my room‚Äôs door and you can‚Äôt open it from the outside anymore.\n\nI‚Äôm getting ready. I don‚Äôt have a hunting license yet. I was supposed to start taking shooting lessons in September, but that‚Äôs still months away. They won‚Äôt wait for me. I took a long knife in the kitchen. My parents haven‚Äôt noticed. They don‚Äôt notice much in normal times either. I hid it in my bed, between the frame and the mattress. I have a baseball bat in the cupboard. I always close it otherwise it blocks my room‚Äôs door and you can‚Äôt open it from the outside anymore. \n\nMany people don‚Äôt come to school anymore. I have two good friends in my class, they still come. In the larger group of people I talk to everyday, maybe half don‚Äôt come anymore. Parents don‚Äôt say anything. Maybe they don‚Äôt know? Teachers don‚Äôt really teach anyway. They‚Äôre fascinated like the rest of them. We don‚Äôt really understand why. It‚Äôs like they all suddenly found how the world works. Or maybe they all found that the world doesn‚Äôt work in a particular way, that none of it matters. Either way, every time I get back home and write in my notebook, I realize it‚Äôs getting worse. Yesterday I thought I should hide it somewhere else, like in the cupboard. I hope I closed the cupboard otherwise it blocks my room‚Äôs door and you can‚Äôt open it from the outside anymore.\n \nI came home an hour ago. My parents are not there yet. I don‚Äôt know if they ever will come back. I just climbed into my room to check on my notebook. I had left it at the usual spot in my desk in the end. I opened it, took a pen, and then it slowly dawned on me. I took a pen and put in in my mouth as if I was pondering on what to write. The knife is too far, I‚Äôll never get to it. The chair is sturdy but it‚Äôs too heavy. The door of my cupboard is always closed otherwise it blocks my room‚Äôs door and you can‚Äôt open it from the outside anymore. Then why is it slightly open?\n",

            "description": "GuilCity is the beginning of an exciting journey bringing Guillaume Cornet‚Äôs densely-packed cities into the generative realm with the help of Matthew‚Äôs (@frostbitten‚Äôs) magic touch.\n\nMatthew‚Äîwith his background in coding and animation‚Äîenables a new opportunity to experience these cities like never before. Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey! \n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you‚Äôve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n‚Äî\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n‚Äî\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n‚Ä¢ https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n‚Äî\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others‚Äô skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci √† tous! Cheers!\n  - Guillaume Cornet, Matthew Seremet",
