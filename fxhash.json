            "description": "This project began as an exploration of how human beings across all sorts of cultures respond in remarkably similar ways in terms of associating sounds with shapes.  That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",

For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

            "description": "Ries is 500 sheets of paper. \nRies is an cut-up text-artwork.\nRies is artwork generated by an algorithm based on seeded random numbers.\nRies is a digital artwork installed in 5 forms in exhibitions setting.\nRies is an NFT artwork. \n\nRies is an artwork where I try bring together my experience of doing gallery exhibitions, my love for generative and copy machine art, DIY-punk aesthetics, NFT’s and chaos. \n\nThe edition of Ries will be installed in different forms and collages in a gallery exhibition in Walden Kunstaustellungen in Berlin in July of 2022. Opening is at 8.7. 19.00, welcome if you are in Berlin.\n/www.galerie-walden.de/\n\nThe seed idea for the project was the method of cut-up where a text (or something else) is cut into pieces and then rearranged to form something new. A modified Markov’s Chain algorithm makes a small text or a group of words from a pool of texts that include Art texts about cut up technique and generative art talk from tweets. These words form a visual bottom layer and then another layer of words samples the first, cutting it up and thus following the theme of the artwork.\n\nSince the single iterations of the project are designed to be used in a collage, they come in various tone, density, detail and scale. One can test from the variations button and get a sense of what the generator produces. \n\nControls in live view:\n-Pressing  j exports the current image as jpeg\n-Pressing  p  exports the current image as png\n\nTo change the detail level one can access the pixel density of render by adding ?pixDens=4 to the end of the URL in live view. You can of course you any number other than 4 also. I it renders just a black image, you have to lower the number, since it is then too large for WEBGL to render.\n\nDesigned to be best rendered on desktop Chrome.\n\nPricing info\n22 tez - Includes a gallery shown, signed print sent to minter by mail or by telefax(!)\n11 tez - A fair price for an artwork, also the minter can personally pick up a signed gallery shown print from the gallery, after the exhibition.\n5 tez - 1/2 fair price\n2 tez - bottom dollar\n\nIf you minted on lower tiers and would want a print, please contact the artist per twitter dm to “upgrade”. If you bought secondary, and would want a print, please contact the artist per twitter dm.\n\nFeatures exist mostly to help with artwork pairing for the collectors.\n\n\nMarkov’s chain code core is based on Markov Me! By https://codepen.io/alexkramerbanjo , MIT License\n\nDisplacement shader based on the wonderful shader examples by Adam Ferris\n\n\nThe artist holds the right to use the whole edition of Ries for display purposes for future exhibitions without asking permission or notifying the owners of the NFT’s.\n\n1.7.2022 in Berlin\nAntti Pussinen\n\nwww.anttipussinen.net\nwww.twitter.com/antti_pussinen\nwww.instagram.com/anttipussinen\n",

            "description": "Ries is 500 sheets of paper. \nRies is an cut-up text-artwork.\nRies is artwork generated by an algorithm based on seeded random numbers.\nRies is a digital artwork installed in 5 forms in exhibitions setting.\nRies is an NFT artwork. \n\nRies is an artwork where I try bring together my experience of doing gallery exhibitions, my love for generative and copy machine art, DIY-punk aesthetics, NFT’s and chaos. \n\nThe edition of Ries will be installed in different forms and collages in a gallery exhibition in Walden Kunstaustellungen in Berlin in July of 2022. Opening is at 8.7. 19.00, welcome if you are in Berlin.\n/www.galerie-walden.de/\n\nThe seed idea for the project was the method of cut-up where a text (or something else) is cut into pieces and then rearranged to form something new. A modified Markov’s Chain algorithm makes a small text or a group of words from a pool of texts that include Art texts about cut up technique and generative art talk from tweets. These words form a visual bottom layer and then another layer of words samples the first, cutting it up and thus following the theme of the artwork.\n\nSince the single iterations of the project are designed to be used in a collage, they come in various tone, density, detail and scale. One can test from the variations button and get a sense of what the generator produces. \n\nControls in live view:\n-Pressing  j exports the current image as jpeg\n-Pressing  p  exports the current image as png\n\nTo change the detail level one can access the pixel density of render by adding ?pixDens=4 to the end of the URL in live view. You can of course you any number other than 4 also. I it renders just a black image, you have to lower the number, since it is then too large for WEBGL to render.\n\nDesigned to be best rendered on desktop Chrome.\n\nPricing info\n22 tez - Includes a gallery shown, signed print sent to minter by mail or by telefax(!)\n11 tez - A fair price for an artwork, also the minter can personally pick up a signed gallery shown print from the gallery, after the exhibition.\n5 tez - 1/2 fair price\n2 tez - bottom dollar\n\nIf you minted on lower tiers and would want a print, please contact the artist per twitter dm to “upgrade”. If you bought secondary, and would want a print, please contact the artist per twitter dm.\n\nFeatures exist mostly to help with artwork pairing for the collectors.\n\n\nMarkov’s chain code core is based on Markov Me! By https://codepen.io/alexkramerbanjo , MIT License\n\nDisplacement shader based on the wonderful shader examples by Adam Ferris\n\n\nThe artist holds the right to use the whole edition of Ries for display purposes for future exhibitions without asking permission or notifying the owners of the NFT’s.\n\n1.7.2022 in Berlin\nAntti Pussinen\n\nwww.anttipussinen.net\nwww.twitter.com/antti_pussinen\nwww.instagram.com/anttipussinen\n",

            "description": "It has always been a goal of mine to incorporate the worlds of physical and digital art together in a piece. And with circumscript I am the closest I've ever been. Circumscript uses a custom shader written to mix and \"dilute\" the colors on the canvas, thus creating a very physical feeling piece.\n\nThis dilution can be more or less depending on the edition, but always plays a huge role in the feel of the piece.\n\n\nHappy new year.\n\n\n----\n\n\n[m] or [double tap] : opens the export/settings menu, use this menu to change the resolution, and make sure to press the reload button if you do.\n[holding down] : zooms in on a certain area of the piece, depending on where your mouse/finger is. Use this feature to expore the complex textures of the piece in more detail, it's highly recommended to do this on a higher resolution setting.\n\nThe outputs can vary slighty per device, as there's a slight difference in how certain math gets interpreted on different devices with shaders.\n\n\n----\n\n\nMade with p5.js and webgl by Wouter Missler in 2022/3.",
