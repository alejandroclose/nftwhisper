            "description": "De/Frag is an homage to a classic algorithm in early computer art: Flood Fill. As a teenager in the late '80s, and without any literature, I spent weeks implementing a version for my very own drawing program for the Atari XL. It was the first non-trivial (to me) algorithm which made me want to learn more about data structures, the concept of recursion, divide-and-conquer...\n\nEven though Flood Fill was available in most commercial drawing & office apps of the time, I gained a deep appreciation of the algorithm by building it from scratch myself. 30+ years later I know its aesthetic possibilities are still far from exhausted. This is an invitation for re-exploration by others too!\n\nAs with many design algorithms, my primary interest isn't even the final result, but observing the inner workings. I massively slowed down and time-sliced the process for this piece. I do recommend giving each of these unique versions some time to allow them to evolve their ever-changing patterns (Note: each piece never loops!).",

It's origin precedes its use with computers by several decades, or centuries, depending on who to credit, since science always is a continuum. In the generative art & design field, the algorithm has been an instrumental tool for generation(s) of practioners, sadly often to the point of turning cliché.\n\nIn this piece I've attempted to \"break\" the classic resulting aesthetics of this algorithm and focus more on revealing its inner workings. There are many ways of computing a Voronoi diagram. The so called Jump Flood Algorithm (JFA) proved to be the visually most interesting approach to me. Again, as with the previous De/Frag piece, here the algorithm has been slowed down, timesliced and customized in dozens of ways to result in a more painterly character overall and produce a variety of new shapes & textures.\n\nFullscreen compatible (Press 'S' to toggle square frame).

            "description": "De/Frag is an homage to a classic algorithm in early computer art: Flood Fill. As a teenager in the late '80s, and without any literature, I spent weeks implementing a version for my very own drawing program for the Atari XL. It was the first non-trivial (to me) algorithm which made me want to learn more about data structures, the concept of recursion, divide-and-conquer...\n\nEven though Flood Fill was available in most commercial drawing & office apps of the time, I gained a deep appreciation of the algorithm by building it from scratch myself. 30+ years later I know its aesthetic possibilities are still far from exhausted. This is an invitation for re-exploration by others too!\n\nAs with many design algorithms, my primary interest isn't even the final result, but observing the inner workings. I massively slowed down and time-sliced the process for this piece. I do recommend giving each of these unique versions some time to allow them to evolve their ever-changing patterns (Note: each piece never loops!).",

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

            "description": "Step by Step explores the feeling of being stuck, confined - walking the path ahead of you often only seeing the immediate next step until exhaustion. We all feel this way from time to time — in our lives, jobs, bodies, situations — yet in our search for something, we shouldn't forget that there can still be beauty along the path.\n\nThe project takes some inspiration from Henri Matisse, both in the aesthetics of his later works (i.e. the \"Cut Outs\") and metaphorically in the sense that he had underwent medical treatment which left him wheelchair- or bed-bound towards the later part of his life, forcing him to give up painting, yet in his exploration of this new creative medium which involved cutting paper and pinning them up, his unorthodox work went on to become the most transformative of his career.\n\nReleased as part of the 4th edition of the Cure³ Parkinson's cure fundraiser exhibition organized by Artwise Curators and Bonhams as part of a specially comissioned selection of generative artists minting NFTs, curated by Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick with the support of fx(hash) at Bonhams, London from 13-17th January 2023.\n\n---\n33% of primary sales and 3% of secondary sales will be donated on-chain to Cure Parkinson’s\n---\n\nControls:\n• 'R' regenerates the piece (e.g. in case the window size changes)\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Jan 2023\nArtist: Yazid",

            "description": "Mudaashiku (「無駄足区」- “Fool’s Errand District”) invokes the place where you first really experienced what it means to be a person in a city. Were you awestruck? Did you feel lost or disoriented by a realization of the size of the spaces around you? Perhaps you sought some detail, some small thing to focus on to reorient yourself and feel like a person again in the face of such immensity and confusion.\n\nThis work is inspired by an attempt to capture some of the feeling I had when I first moved to Tokyo and was utterly overwhelmed. It was both exciting and frightening to suddenly be lost in a place so immense and unfamiliar. If Stendhal Syndrome refers to the fearful ecstasy of experiencing the beauties of Florence, then there must be something similar for the first experience of a great city. This work attempts only to point in the direction of such a feeling.\n\nTake a moment to experience the district as a whole, but then, with a change of perception, your focus may shift to the individual building or group of buildings. And then, back again. This duality of scales has been integral to the development of the work.\n\nThe work expresses eight features:\nAspect ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.41, 1.41:1, 1.2:1\nEnvironment: Central (most common), north river, east river, south causeway, west causeway (most rare).\nPalette: Thirty seven selected palettes. Chosen either for their aesthetic qualities, or as an attempted expression of some element of urban life.\nDivisions: 15, 18, or 21.\nColor variance: 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36, 0.54.\nSun direction: East or west.\nLocale: Either central or commuter town. Determines the height profile of the district.\nRoads: Represented, or not.\n\nThe work begins by gradually revealing the layout of the district. This process can take from about 6 seconds to as much as 2 minutes, but 50 to 60 seconds is typical. When this process is complete, the colors and facades will be added and the work revealed.\n\nOnce the work is complete, it can be adjusted using the following controls:\n\n[0] Fit size to window (default)\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels\n[4] Set shortest edge to 8000 pixels (please be patient!)\n\nAfter changing the dimensions, the work may appear the same size in your browser. The new dimensions will be apparent when you save an image.\n\n[s] Save work at current dimensions\n[b] Add or remove border\n[g] Add or remove background grain\n\nMade in 100% vanilla javascript.\nOpenSimplexNoise.js used for noise.\n",

            "description": "Mudaashiku (「無駄足区」- “Fool’s Errand District”) invokes the place where you first really experienced what it means to be a person in a city. Were you awestruck? Did you feel lost or disoriented by a realization of the size of the spaces around you? Perhaps you sought some detail, some small thing to focus on to reorient yourself and feel like a person again in the face of such immensity and confusion.\n\nThis work is inspired by an attempt to capture some of the feeling I had when I first moved to Tokyo and was utterly overwhelmed. It was both exciting and frightening to suddenly be lost in a place so immense and unfamiliar. If Stendhal Syndrome refers to the fearful ecstasy of experiencing the beauties of Florence, then there must be something similar for the first experience of a great city. This work attempts only to point in the direction of such a feeling.\n\nTake a moment to experience the district as a whole, but then, with a change of perception, your focus may shift to the individual building or group of buildings. And then, back again. This duality of scales has been integral to the development of the work.\n\nThe work expresses eight features:\nAspect ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.41, 1.41:1, 1.2:1\nEnvironment: Central (most common), north river, east river, south causeway, west causeway (most rare).\nPalette: Thirty seven selected palettes. Chosen either for their aesthetic qualities, or as an attempted expression of some element of urban life.\nDivisions: 15, 18, or 21.\nColor variance: 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36, 0.54.\nSun direction: East or west.\nLocale: Either central or commuter town. Determines the height profile of the district.\nRoads: Represented, or not.\n\nThe work begins by gradually revealing the layout of the district. This process can take from about 6 seconds to as much as 2 minutes, but 50 to 60 seconds is typical. When this process is complete, the colors and facades will be added and the work revealed.\n\nOnce the work is complete, it can be adjusted using the following controls:\n\n[0] Fit size to window (default)\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels\n[4] Set shortest edge to 8000 pixels (please be patient!)\n\nAfter changing the dimensions, the work may appear the same size in your browser. The new dimensions will be apparent when you save an image.\n\n[s] Save work at current dimensions\n[b] Add or remove border\n[g] Add or remove background grain\n\nMade in 100% vanilla javascript.\nOpenSimplexNoise.js used for noise.\n",
