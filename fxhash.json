            "description": "‚ÄúFelix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas‚Äù\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state ‚Äì heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil‚Äôs quote from the beginning translates to: ‚ÄúFortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things‚Äù. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP üññ\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 ‚Äì 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz‚Äôs ‚Äúadrift‚Äù, lunarean's ‚ÄúHeat Death‚Äù, and Monotau‚Äôs ‚ÄúCradle‚Äù collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

            "description": "It may appear as an indecipherable map to some. To others, it may present itself as a cross section of an underground cave. Or maybe an uncanny landscape of volcanic activity, a diagram of geological strata, or even something else entirely. Some vague structure may also appear; is it the remains of an ancient civilization? Or perhaps a glimpse into our own tomorrow?\n\nIn \"Agharta\", I sought to create a generative work that could invite the viewer to explore the depths of their imagination and uncover hidden structures within the seemingly chaotic composition. The idea came to me when I was exploring Simplex noise and pixel displacement in Cables. I was surprised by the emergent structures that appeared when some set of parameters paired with the right texture. \n\nThe title of the piece references the mythical underground world said to be located at the earth's core. This idea of hidden depths and secret worlds within the earth resonates with the abstract and enigmatic nature of the result generated by the noise. Imagery of landscape, vague structures, or geological features may appear but never stand out on its own; it exists in a state of constant flow and intersection as if viewed from another dimension. And just like the myth itself that bring up numerous theories that doesn‚Äôt necessarily connected to each other, it hints at that idea of an elusive imagined realm while never actually represent it completely.\n\n\n\n=========\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024px (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048px\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840px\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[Scroll/pinch] to zoom and drag to pan\n\n[r] or [zoom out to max] Reset position\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot of the current state at rendered resolution\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* This project use shaders that relies on GPU. Hi-res output may slow down your device. Since it also utilize GPU instance for thumbnail rendering, expect longer time for every iterations to be signed by fx(hash).\n\n* If 'glitching' occurs or the composition behaves differently at different resolution, just refresh the page to reset it (except for the thin lines, which are always drawn at approximately 1 pixel, so expect it to vary at different resolution).\n\nMade with cables.gl, a node-based webgl environment\n\nXALTED 2022",

            "description": "It may appear as an indecipherable map to some. To others, it may present itself as a cross section of an underground cave. Or maybe an uncanny landscape of volcanic activity, a diagram of geological strata, or even something else entirely. Some vague structure may also appear; is it the remains of an ancient civilization? Or perhaps a glimpse into our own tomorrow?\n\nIn \"Agharta\", I sought to create a generative work that could invite the viewer to explore the depths of their imagination and uncover hidden structures within the seemingly chaotic composition. The idea came to me when I was exploring Simplex noise and pixel displacement in Cables. I was surprised by the emergent structures that appeared when some set of parameters paired with the right texture. \n\nThe title of the piece references the mythical underground world said to be located at the earth's core. This idea of hidden depths and secret worlds within the earth resonates with the abstract and enigmatic nature of the result generated by the noise. Imagery of landscape, vague structures, or geological features may appear but never stand out on its own; it exists in a state of constant flow and intersection as if viewed from another dimension. And just like the myth itself that bring up numerous theories that doesn‚Äôt necessarily connected to each other, it hints at that idea of an elusive imagined realm while never actually represent it completely.\n\n\n\n=========\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024px (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048px\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840px\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[Scroll/pinch] to zoom and drag to pan\n\n[r] or [zoom out to max] Reset position\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot of the current state at rendered resolution\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* This project use shaders that relies on GPU. Hi-res output may slow down your device. Since it also utilize GPU instance for thumbnail rendering, expect longer time for every iterations to be signed by fx(hash).\n\n* If 'glitching' occurs or the composition behaves differently at different resolution, just refresh the page to reset it (except for the thin lines, which are always drawn at approximately 1 pixel, so expect it to vary at different resolution).\n\nMade with cables.gl, a node-based webgl environment\n\nXALTED 2022",

Some vague structure may also appear; is it the remains of an ancient civilization? Or perhaps a glimpse into our own tomorrow?\n\nIn \"Agharta\", I sought to create a generative work that could invite the viewer to explore the depths of their imagination and uncover hidden structures within the seemingly chaotic composition. The idea came to me when I was exploring Simplex noise and pixel displacement in Cables. I was surprised by the emergent structures that appeared when some set of parameters paired with the right texture. \n\nThe title of the piece references the mythical underground world said to be located at the earth's core. This idea of hidden depths and secret worlds within the earth resonates with the abstract and enigmatic nature of the result generated by the noise. Imagery of landscape, vague structures, or geological features may appear but never stand out on its own; it exists in a state of constant flow and intersection as if viewed from another dimension. And just like the myth itself that bring up numerous theories that doesn‚Äôt necessarily connected to each other, it hints at that idea of an elusive imagined realm while never actually represent it completely.\n\n\n\n=========\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024px (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048px\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840px\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[Scroll/pinch] to zoom and drag to pan\n\n[r] or [zoom out to max] Reset position\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot of the current state at rendered resolution\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* This project use shaders that relies on GPU. Hi-res output may slow down your device. Since it also utilize GPU instance for thumbnail rendering, expect longer time for every iterations to be signed by fx(hash).\n\n* If 'glitching' occurs or the composition behaves differently at different resolution, just refresh the page to reset it (except for the thin lines, which are always drawn at approximately 1 pixel, so expect it to vary at different resolution).\n\nMade with cables.gl, a node-based webgl environment\n\nXALTED 2022",

            "description": "It may appear as an indecipherable map to some. To others, it may present itself as a cross section of an underground cave. Or maybe an uncanny landscape of volcanic activity, a diagram of geological strata, or even something else entirely. Some vague structure may also appear; is it the remains of an ancient civilization? Or perhaps a glimpse into our own tomorrow?\n\nIn \"Agharta\", I sought to create a generative work that could invite the viewer to explore the depths of their imagination and uncover hidden structures within the seemingly chaotic composition. The idea came to me when I was exploring Simplex noise and pixel displacement in Cables. I was surprised by the emergent structures that appeared when some set of parameters paired with the right texture. \n\nThe title of the piece references the mythical underground world said to be located at the earth's core. This idea of hidden depths and secret worlds within the earth resonates with the abstract and enigmatic nature of the result generated by the noise. Imagery of landscape, vague structures, or geological features may appear but never stand out on its own; it exists in a state of constant flow and intersection as if viewed from another dimension. And just like the myth itself that bring up numerous theories that doesn‚Äôt necessarily connected to each other, it hints at that idea of an elusive imagined realm while never actually represent it completely.\n\n\n\n=========\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024px (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048px\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840px\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[Scroll/pinch] to zoom and drag to pan\n\n[r] or [zoom out to max] Reset position\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot of the current state at rendered resolution\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* This project use shaders that relies on GPU. Hi-res output may slow down your device. Since it also utilize GPU instance for thumbnail rendering, expect longer time for every iterations to be signed by fx(hash).\n\n* If 'glitching' occurs or the composition behaves differently at different resolution, just refresh the page to reset it (except for the thin lines, which are always drawn at approximately 1 pixel, so expect it to vary at different resolution).\n\nMade with cables.gl, a node-based webgl environment\n\nXALTED 2022",
