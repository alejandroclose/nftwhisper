It involves arranging, manipulating and combining circles to form different shapes, patterns and designs.\nHere, concepts such as symmetry, balance, rhythm and repetition are often examined. I used circles of different sizes, colors, textures, and opacity to create depth and visual interest, and added compositions like squiggly lines for complexity and variety.\nThe possibilities are endless when it comes to circles, as they have the freedom to experiment with different techniques and styles. It can take many forms including minimal, abstract designs, mandalas (spiritual symbols), optical illusions or even representational images made entirely of circles.\nBy focusing on the simplicity and versatility of circles, I have created a visual approach that evokes harmony, unity, and balance while also allowing for creative expression.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",
