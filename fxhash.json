            "description": "Inspired and fascinated by Brutalism, Modernism and Bauhaus, I've started to explore the deeper connections of architecture using pixel art in a clean, minimalistic and unique way.\n\nThe BRUTALIST MOVEMENT project represents the next step in this process. It's an animated generative experiment that focuses on finding the simplest and fewest components that - when generated randomly - always create structures resembling buildings: from small modern houses through industrial facilities to gigantic brutalist monuments.\n\nThis resulted in 4 main components: Base, Extension, Gap and Window. These entities are used randomly to create Blocks that form the final structure. \nThe whole process is also strictly accompanied by 4 distinct components to hold colors and to be set by randomly chosen palettes: Sky, Sun, Shadow, Window.\n\nFeatures consist of a mixture of the above components.\n\nThe project is animated to show how the buildings come to life. It's also a nice way to show what's going on in the background, because from time to time a bigger block would surely hide interesting smaller ones :) \n\nPress these keys:\n's' - to download a larger resolution PNG\n'n' - to shuffle through the 'depth' of Blocks, aka placing them from front to back and vice versa. This is a nice feature to show structures hidden by others and also a cool way to create iterations inside the iteration - sub-iterations - we can say :)\n'r' - to reset the Blocks' depths to default\n\nPlease note:\nEverything you see is generated, animated and drawn real-time. No layered transparent PNGs, PFP or similar!\n\nHave fun and inspiration!\n\n\n@cloudnoise © 2022\n\n☁︎\n\nCreated with P5.js library.",

It is recommended that you view the work in 4K or 6K to appreciate the finer details. \n\nThe keyboard buttons: “2”, “4”, and “6” can be pressed to change the resolution to 2K, 4K and 6K resolution accordingly. \n\nTo download an image at its current resolution, press the keyboard button “S”.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtwork created with p5.js\n\n@nbswwit\nSept 2022\n",

Inspired by Wiederrecht’s mastery of line and Vittoria’s notable palette, this 1/1/250 series captures the present moment.

            "description": "Take your entire life, full as it is with the vastness of your lived experiences – and shape it into your cupped hands. Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",
