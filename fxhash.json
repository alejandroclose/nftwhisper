This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

Ant colonies, mushrooms, and trees all follow basic principles, yet their resulting actions and growth patterns are fascinatingly intricate. For example, ants can exhibit intelligent collective behavior, fungi are highly successful organisms that make up a larger biomass than all animals combined, and each tree is unique.\n\nThese emergent properties arise from the environment in which these simple rules operate. A tree's growth is influenced by many factors such as soil, water, seasons, wind, humidity, light, and interactions with other plants and animals.\n\nThis series is a reflection on the beauty and uniqueness of each living thing, and how complexity emerges from simplicity.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, we’ve used a custom variant of the \"reaction-diffusion\" algorithm, which approximates some biological systems. This algorithm was introduced by Alan Turing in 1952 in his paper titled \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis.\" The rules are very simple but by changing the initial conditions and adding perturbations, we can reach very different visual outcomes.\n\nIn this way we create a dialog between the strict mathematical rules interpreted by the machine and the organic visuals that emerge from it.\n\n--------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2560px resolution\nPress 'P' to save the image at 3840px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\n\n--------\n\nWilliam Watkins\nApril 2023",

            "description": "A relatively simple idea: columns filled with many thin horizontal lines, layered with complexity from colour features, stroke styles, and column perturbations. The compositions that emerge may be harmonious or asynchronous, comforting or jarring, wistful, mysterious, subtle, or bold.\n\nThe piece is generated as follows:\n\nFirst, borders and columns are defined. The canvas may have one or two borders, ranging from small to large, and the inner border may or may not have a coloured edge and fill. If they are not coloured, the feature \"Hidden Background\" will be true. Each column is assigned three colours at random from one of several possible colour palettes. The top and bottom boundaries of each column are set, and in some iterations, there is a chance that columns will break outside the border boundaries.\n\nAs columns are drawn from top to bottom, there are several events that may occur with probabilities pre-defined for each iteration: 1) The stroke colour may switch abruptly or over a gradient between two of the three column colours. 2) A 'repeater' pattern may be triggered, where two of the column colours alternate with a given frequency and rate of decay. 3) Single 'accent' bands may occur with the third column colour. 4) 'Bulges' may form with either rectangle, diamond, sin wave, or 'skirt' shapes.\n\nThere may also be horizontal bands that span the entire image, with a certain variability of height across columns.\n\nStrokes may be straight lines or Bezier curves. Bezier curves may be uniform for an iteration, where the control points of the curves are generated from a single formula for the whole image, or they may be random. Strokes may also have horizontal and/or vertical 'line fuzz', where the start and end points of the line are randomly offset in either direction.\n\nStraight strokes may or may not have a solid base-layer drawn underneath, which gives the image a more filled vs. sketched appearance. Top strokes may also be partially transparent, allowing for a layered effect.\n\nColumns are drawn in one of several possible orders, and once the initial drawing is complete, columns will be redrawn slowly and the image will evolve over time.\n\nPress '2', '4', '6', '8', or '0' to re-draw at 2K, 4K, 6K, 8K, or 10K resolution (shortest edge), which will also save an image when the initial draw is complete and before animation begins.\n\nPress 's' at any time to save an image at the current resolution.",

Ant colonies, mushrooms, and trees all follow basic principles, yet their resulting actions and growth patterns are fascinatingly intricate. For example, ants can exhibit intelligent collective behavior, fungi are highly successful organisms that make up a larger biomass than all animals combined, and each tree is unique.\n\nThese emergent properties arise from the environment in which these simple rules operate. A tree's growth is influenced by many factors such as soil, water, seasons, wind, humidity, light, and interactions with other plants and animals.\n\nThis series is a reflection on the beauty and uniqueness of each living thing, and how complexity emerges from simplicity.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, we’ve used a custom variant of the \"reaction-diffusion\" algorithm, which approximates some biological systems. This algorithm was introduced by Alan Turing in 1952 in his paper titled \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis.\" The rules are very simple but by changing the initial conditions and adding perturbations, we can reach very different visual outcomes.\n\nIn this way we create a dialog between the strict mathematical rules interpreted by the machine and the organic visuals that emerge from it.\n\n--------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2560px resolution\nPress 'P' to save the image at 3840px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\n\n--------\n\nWilliam Watkins\nApril 2023",

            "description": "A relatively simple idea: columns filled with many thin horizontal lines, layered with complexity from colour features, stroke styles, and column perturbations. The compositions that emerge may be harmonious or asynchronous, comforting or jarring, wistful, mysterious, subtle, or bold.\n\nThe piece is generated as follows:\n\nFirst, borders and columns are defined. The canvas may have one or two borders, ranging from small to large, and the inner border may or may not have a coloured edge and fill. If they are not coloured, the feature \"Hidden Background\" will be true. Each column is assigned three colours at random from one of several possible colour palettes. The top and bottom boundaries of each column are set, and in some iterations, there is a chance that columns will break outside the border boundaries.\n\nAs columns are drawn from top to bottom, there are several events that may occur with probabilities pre-defined for each iteration: 1) The stroke colour may switch abruptly or over a gradient between two of the three column colours. 2) A 'repeater' pattern may be triggered, where two of the column colours alternate with a given frequency and rate of decay. 3) Single 'accent' bands may occur with the third column colour. 4) 'Bulges' may form with either rectangle, diamond, sin wave, or 'skirt' shapes.\n\nThere may also be horizontal bands that span the entire image, with a certain variability of height across columns.\n\nStrokes may be straight lines or Bezier curves. Bezier curves may be uniform for an iteration, where the control points of the curves are generated from a single formula for the whole image, or they may be random. Strokes may also have horizontal and/or vertical 'line fuzz', where the start and end points of the line are randomly offset in either direction.\n\nStraight strokes may or may not have a solid base-layer drawn underneath, which gives the image a more filled vs. sketched appearance. Top strokes may also be partially transparent, allowing for a layered effect.\n\nColumns are drawn in one of several possible orders, and once the initial drawing is complete, columns will be redrawn slowly and the image will evolve over time.\n\nPress '2', '4', '6', '8', or '0' to re-draw at 2K, 4K, 6K, 8K, or 10K resolution (shortest edge), which will also save an image when the initial draw is complete and before animation begins.\n\nPress 's' at any time to save an image at the current resolution.",

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

The compositions that emerge may be harmonious or asynchronous, comforting or jarring, wistful, mysterious, subtle, or bold.\n\nThe piece is generated as follows:\n\nFirst, borders and columns are defined. The canvas may have one or two borders, ranging from small to large, and the inner border may or may not have a coloured edge and fill. If they are not coloured, the feature \"Hidden Background\" will be true. Each column is assigned three colours at random from one of several possible colour palettes. The top and bottom boundaries of each column are set, and in some iterations, there is a chance that columns will break outside the border boundaries.\n\nAs columns are drawn from top to bottom, there are several events that may occur with probabilities pre-defined for each iteration: 1) The stroke colour may switch abruptly or over a gradient between two of the three column colours. 2) A 'repeater' pattern may be triggered, where two of the column colours alternate with a given frequency and rate of decay. 3) Single 'accent' bands may occur with the third column colour. 4) 'Bulges' may form with either rectangle, diamond, sin wave, or 'skirt' shapes.\n\nThere may also be horizontal bands that span the entire image, with a certain variability of height across columns.\n\nStrokes may be straight lines or Bezier curves. Bezier curves may be uniform for an iteration, where the control points of the curves are generated from a single formula for the whole image, or they may be random. Strokes may also have horizontal and/or vertical 'line fuzz', where the start and end points of the line are randomly offset in either direction.\n\nStraight strokes may or may not have a solid base-layer drawn underneath, which gives the image a more filled vs. sketched appearance. Top strokes may also be partially transparent, allowing for a layered effect.\n\nColumns are drawn in one of several possible orders, and once the initial drawing is complete, columns will be redrawn slowly and the image will evolve over time.\n\nPress '2', '4', '6', '8', or '0' to re-draw at 2K, 4K, 6K, 8K, or 10K resolution (shortest edge), which will also save an image when the initial draw is complete and before animation begins.\n\nPress 's' at any time to save an image at the current resolution.",

            "description": "Our lives are like a rich tapestry of interconnected moments, emotions, and decisions that weave and evolve through space and time. These experiences meld together, forming the intricate fabric of our being, shaping our perspectives, and influencing our sense of self, identity, and worldview. Within this elaborate lattice of life, the delicate threads that fill the interstitial spaces illuminate our existence's fluid and ever-changing dynamics.\n\n\"Liminalia\" is an abstract generative art collection that celebrates these liminal moments and spaces that define us, embracing the beauty of imperfection, transformation, and the interrelation of human experiences. The collection employs abstract visual language to portray the delicate balance between randomness and structure, emphasising the significance of our perception of time in shaping these elements and our individual experiences.\n\nThe collection explores life's complexity through the interwoven colours and picture planes that create fluid spaces and in-between zones. With an appreciation for natural surfaces and organic processes, such as erosion, ageing, and patina formation, the collection emphasizes interconnectedness through an organic aesthetic. The carefully designed colour palettes, inspired by various events and phenomena, capture the essence of time and enhance the liminal themes explored throughout the collection.\n\nThrough its harmonious blend of colour, form, and space, \"Liminalia\" explores the subtle junctures where time, nature, and personal development meet and interact. The collection fosters a dialogue between art, science, and the enigmatic mysteries of our existence, underlining the ties between humans and the ever-evolving beauty of the natural world. Consequently, it imparts a sense of optimism, prompting self-reflection and contemplation, and encourages us to appreciate the inherent charm of time's rhythm and the interdependence of all things.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nfx(params)\nLiminalia has recently introduced the fx(params) system, allowing initial minters greater engagement and influence over the final artwork. This innovative system lets you to personalize the final output while exposing the algorithm to greater scrutiny. As a token of appreciation, 20% of the royalties go to the minter.\n\nFor more information on Liminalia's core themes, creative process, and key parameters, see my recently published article at https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/liminalia.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical\nMade with P5JS and Chroma.js\nOptimized and best viewed in Chrome.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nResolution and Printing\nLiminalia is best experienced in print, providing an immersive and detailed view of the intricate details, rich colour palettes and dynamic interplay of themes.\n\nControls in live mode\n# Press [1] - [5] to change the resolution.\n# Press [s] or [j] to save as PNG or JPEG at the current resolution\nHigh res [5] will output a 10,500px x 16,000px image.\nPlease note that the rendering is processed in 3 main steps, and the filters applied at the end may take a few minutes to render for very high resolution.\n\nTo track the progress of the rendering process, access the development console in your desktop browser.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nLicense\nThis project is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAcknowledgements\nA big shout-out to everyone who pitched in on this project; your input and effort were invaluable. I'm grateful for your collaboration, and you all totally rock!\n------------------------------------------------------------",

Ant colonies, mushrooms, and trees all follow basic principles, yet their resulting actions and growth patterns are fascinatingly intricate. For example, ants can exhibit intelligent collective behavior, fungi are highly successful organisms that make up a larger biomass than all animals combined, and each tree is unique.\n\nThese emergent properties arise from the environment in which these simple rules operate. A tree's growth is influenced by many factors such as soil, water, seasons, wind, humidity, light, and interactions with other plants and animals.\n\nThis series is a reflection on the beauty and uniqueness of each living thing, and how complexity emerges from simplicity.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, we’ve used a custom variant of the \"reaction-diffusion\" algorithm, which approximates some biological systems. This algorithm was introduced by Alan Turing in 1952 in his paper titled \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis.\" The rules are very simple but by changing the initial conditions and adding perturbations, we can reach very different visual outcomes.\n\nIn this way we create a dialog between the strict mathematical rules interpreted by the machine and the organic visuals that emerge from it.\n\n--------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2560px resolution\nPress 'P' to save the image at 3840px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\n\n--------\n\nWilliam Watkins\nApril 2023",

            "description": "　During the winter months, when I do not see any flowers in the city, it is as if I have forgotten that flowers exist. Sometimes, some time after the flowers have disappeared from the world, I suddenly spot a red bud on a branch poking out from the eaves of a house. It is a time when I have become accustomed to winter and have grown too accustomed to it. I am red! I think. Red! That is the ”ume\" blossom. Many people think of cherry blossoms when they think of spring flowers, but my favorite spring flower is the ume blossom. It is a wonderful flower that reminds me that there are flowers in the world and that spring is coming.\n　Ume blossoms are forgotten by the time the cherry blossoms bloom. I was born into this world on April 5, right on the border of when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom or not. I am born every year with the news that the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. But the plum blossoms are history. They are history and predecessors who built the world before I was born. When I am born again toward spring, I want to cherish the past. With this in mind, I created this work, wondering if I could paint the ume blossoms.\n　When I was making this, I felt like I was making sweets. It was a new sensation for me. The sensation of taking something that is commonplace in everyday life and cooking it in my own way was exactly like making sweets. I don't think sweets are noble. But I think they are something a little special. Above all, when sweets are placed in front of you, they bring forth a calm joy that cannot be contained from the bottom of one's heart. If there were many colors of such joy, if there were various kinds of sweets, I am sure we would be happy. This is a ume sweet. Please try it. I believe that these will become our cells and our past.\n\nume = 梅\n　This time, I put words to the color palette and shapes. It is not a universal language, but it is a special sound for me. If you want to know the meaning of the words, please ask me on twitter : @shirasu_nejio. However, I don't think that meaning is necessarily essential.",
