            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

I have developed a huge library, designed for hand-like drawing. The functionality of this library is four times larger than what is shown in this drop.\n\nI plan to put this library out into the public domain when I deem it complete, and hope that it will help someone express themselves through the creative process as much as it helped for me.\n\nIn case you've encountered a problem with inverted colours, try changing browser or disabling extensions. This problem only occurred once during testing on a massive amount of devices and was resolved by disabling extensions.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES BLOCK:\n\nNOTE 1: This artwork should be viewed at a browser scale of 100%. Reducing the scale will increase the amount of detail, but may unpredictably affect the preservation of the location of secondary objects.\n\nNOTE 2: This work can be printed on a plotter. Click S for saving it in .SVG.\nDetailed instructions and answers to possible questions can be found in the console output of the code.\n\nNOTE 3: This drop is the first one from the series of 3. It will be used as AL ticket in next drops of this series.\n\n@abakshonokoleg\n01.08.2022\nTech: P5.JS\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)",

It’s the one thin string binding our real-life experience with blockchain.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nIf you want a larger scene with more detail (larger resolution), zoom out using the browser zoom. Be careful as the more you zoom out the more ground elements will be created to fill the scene.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nPricing - Dutch auction\nThe pricing is a Dutch auction set at 4 - 3 - 3. 433 is the number of randomized variables in the piece.\n\nMint amount\nThe mint amount is 170. 170 is the number of unique elements multiplied by 10.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nThe binding string started with a focus on maximizing the possible variations.\n\nThis has led to the project having 433 randomizable variables that tweak the scene to create insane variation. A lot of this variation is very subtle, but it’s there.\n\nRandom variables: 433 = 281 (rand int) + 62 (rand float) + 90 (Perlin noise).\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nThe binding string has multiple layered scene elements. Some of these elements interact. Plants are forced back by the halo, elements closer to the central glowing rock reflect more light etc. There are 17 elements in total.\n\nHere are some of the elements that characterize the narrative and aesthetic:\nStone circle\nPlanets\nPlants (trees, bushes)\nFireflies\nAnimated halo\nGlyph text\nA smart, fully randomized custom palette creator.\nGeometric shapes\nAtmosphere scenarios ( day, evening, night, foggy)\nRocks\nMossy-ness\nCrystal Geodes\nSkewed hills\nGround elements (mud, grass)\nMath based lighting\nGalaxy lines\nShadow dust\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nExtra special thanks to @nathansonic for his support, feedback, and code editions.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\n3rd party code used:\nVarious bits by @nathansonic, including a custom palette creator.\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+",

            "description": "This project draws inspiration from the dynamic and exploratory ethos of Hic Et Nunc's early days, when artists were venturing into the possibilities of NFTs and pushing creative boundaries.\n\nThe color palettes were inadvertently provided by some talented artists who had originally intended them for another project, which was ultimately completed but never published.\nHarvey McFly is to blame for the leak.\n\nThe color palettes have been paired together, creating an unexpected chromatic collaboration between the artists.\n\nI have chosen to mint this project from TheWallet, as it represents one of the most intriguing experiments ever conducted on a blockchain.\n\nThis is the inaugural work to be published on fx(hash) through TheWallet, and I hope that other artists will follow suit and engage in this playful and nonsensical practice in the future.\n\nA special thanks goes out to @TheWalletNft, who suggested the idea of minting on fx(hash) and handled the profile setup on the site.\n\nThe open and collaborative nature of TheWallet allows anyone with the seed phrase to modify the sale and to publish any kind of content from TheWallet. For this reason this profile is not, and should never be verified by fx(hash) and collectors should pay extra caution when collecting from it.\n\nYours, CCDDBB\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\nPowered by p5 and chroma.\n\n----------------------------------------------\nTheWallet original post: https://typed.art/967\n----------------------------------------------\n\n",
