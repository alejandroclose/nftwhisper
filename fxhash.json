            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "Field Sketch\n\nThis is a 100% generative abstract project. I'm experimenting again with sketchy rough drawing and trying to create something that looks like it could have been created by hand. There are seven composition types that produce different styles of output.\n\nThis project uses the fx(params) WYSIWYG functionality so the minter will get exactly the output they configure.\n\nExplanation of Numeric Params (all have range 0-100):\n\nXBounds - low values have primary structures near the middle of the horizontal axis\n\nYBounds - low values have primary structures near the middle of the vertical axis. For Quantized composition types this also affects the vertical level of the vanishing points.\n\nStructureSmooth - low values have a more complex global structure\n\nDetailSmooth - low values have a more complex fine structure\n\nSegmentLength - low values have more but shorter lines drawn\n\nAngleVariation - low values have more coherent line direction\n\nColorNoise - the higher the value the more random color variation for each line segment\n\nOrder - low values have the lines follow the flow fields in a more chaotic fashion\n\nBlur - higher values will use blur on top and bottom of output to simulate depth of field\n\nSymmetry - The possible values are no symmetry, 3, 4, 6, or 12. Any symmetry will be imperfect - it guides the construction of the composition but other random factors will usually prevent an exactly symmetrical result.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThere are some keyboard operations available.\n\nClick on the output and use these keys to affect it:\n's' - save at current resolution\n'2' - change to 2000 x 2000 resolution\n'3' - change to 3000 x 3000 resolution\n...\n'8' - change to 8000 x 8000 resolution\n\nNote that at higher resolutions there will be some minor variation in output.\n\nCopyright 2023 Jeff Clark\n--------------------------\n100% generative\n\nAll drawing and geometric code created by Jeff Clark using standard javascript and canvas 2D api.

            "description": "When observing the universe we can see both order and chaos, \"Less Mess\" is the relationship between those two forces. Randomness and order are everywhere, in each iteration of nature we can see both forces taking place. Each matter observed by us is made from ordered atoms, but each matter in its base is random and unique.\n\nThis work evolved from a simple grid. While it started as a very ordered grid, I pushed as hard as possible to make it messy and randomly beautiful. After applying a lot of mess, it becomes very busy and the order was gone. When the mess was all over the place, I started to reduce it, step by step, to bring the harmony back.\n\nThe best results are from 1000x1000 and above.\n\nThis work was created using p5.js and ❤\n\nTwitter: @AsafSlook\nInstagram: @asaf_slook",

            "description": "We are filling our one and only world with our endless cities, roads and structures, for as far as the eye can see. We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it. Thank you very much for collecting and for your continuous support.\n\n10% of primary and secondary sales will go to fxhash team; thank you for what you are doing.\n\nSelf reserved pieces are for promised gifts to my collectors.\n\nPress S to save as PNG.

            "description": "Field Sketch\n\nThis is a 100% generative abstract project. I'm experimenting again with sketchy rough drawing and trying to create something that looks like it could have been created by hand. There are seven composition types that produce different styles of output.\n\nThis project uses the fx(params) WYSIWYG functionality so the minter will get exactly the output they configure.\n\nExplanation of Numeric Params (all have range 0-100):\n\nXBounds - low values have primary structures near the middle of the horizontal axis\n\nYBounds - low values have primary structures near the middle of the vertical axis. For Quantized composition types this also affects the vertical level of the vanishing points.\n\nStructureSmooth - low values have a more complex global structure\n\nDetailSmooth - low values have a more complex fine structure\n\nSegmentLength - low values have more but shorter lines drawn\n\nAngleVariation - low values have more coherent line direction\n\nColorNoise - the higher the value the more random color variation for each line segment\n\nOrder - low values have the lines follow the flow fields in a more chaotic fashion\n\nBlur - higher values will use blur on top and bottom of output to simulate depth of field\n\nSymmetry - The possible values are no symmetry, 3, 4, 6, or 12. Any symmetry will be imperfect - it guides the construction of the composition but other random factors will usually prevent an exactly symmetrical result.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThere are some keyboard operations available.\n\nClick on the output and use these keys to affect it:\n's' - save at current resolution\n'2' - change to 2000 x 2000 resolution\n'3' - change to 3000 x 3000 resolution\n...\n'8' - change to 8000 x 8000 resolution\n\nNote that at higher resolutions there will be some minor variation in output.\n\nCopyright 2023 Jeff Clark\n--------------------------\n100% generative\n\nAll drawing and geometric code created by Jeff Clark using standard javascript and canvas 2D api. Perlin noise was used with support from perlin.js at https://codepen.io/sixsided/pen/emxxea.js\n\n",

            "description": "Field Sketch\n\nThis is a 100% generative abstract project. I'm experimenting again with sketchy rough drawing and trying to create something that looks like it could have been created by hand. There are seven composition types that produce different styles of output.\n\nThis project uses the fx(params) WYSIWYG functionality so the minter will get exactly the output they configure.\n\nExplanation of Numeric Params (all have range 0-100):\n\nXBounds - low values have primary structures near the middle of the horizontal axis\n\nYBounds - low values have primary structures near the middle of the vertical axis. For Quantized composition types this also affects the vertical level of the vanishing points.\n\nStructureSmooth - low values have a more complex global structure\n\nDetailSmooth - low values have a more complex fine structure\n\nSegmentLength - low values have more but shorter lines drawn\n\nAngleVariation - low values have more coherent line direction\n\nColorNoise - the higher the value the more random color variation for each line segment\n\nOrder - low values have the lines follow the flow fields in a more chaotic fashion\n\nBlur - higher values will use blur on top and bottom of output to simulate depth of field\n\nSymmetry - The possible values are no symmetry, 3, 4, 6, or 12. Any symmetry will be imperfect - it guides the construction of the composition but other random factors will usually prevent an exactly symmetrical result.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThere are some keyboard operations available.\n\nClick on the output and use these keys to affect it:\n's' - save at current resolution\n'2' - change to 2000 x 2000 resolution\n'3' - change to 3000 x 3000 resolution\n...\n'8' - change to 8000 x 8000 resolution\n\nNote that at higher resolutions there will be some minor variation in output.\n\nCopyright 2023 Jeff Clark\n--------------------------\n100% generative\n\nAll drawing and geometric code created by Jeff Clark using standard javascript and canvas 2D api. Perlin noise was used with support from perlin.js at https://codepen.io/sixsided/pen/emxxea.js\n\n",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s.

Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state. Press \"h\" to save it.\n\nUninhabitable is an original work by Iskra Velitchkova. 2021.",
