            "description": "“Thébaïde” is a french word for wild place, remote and peaceful, where to live in a calm retreat. It's also simply a desert and a synonym of solitude. It comes from Thebaid, an arid region of ancient Egypt and Thebes was the capital.\n\n“thébaïde” is my debut on fx(hash), almost one year since my first works minted on Objkt (a series of Indian ink drawings, in January 2022). After learning the basics of creative coding recently, and a few works with this technique, I decided to create a first generative project. With \"thébaïde\" I chose to express the minimalist and narrative aspects of my artistic approach (though the title and concept emerged at the end). Gradually the work was resonating with philosophical matters I'm obsessed with since years: time, emptiness, human condition, erosion, desire, chance, combining them into a visual metaphor. The view of a vast area, a changing silhouette, an impenetrable monolith or an opening to elsewhere or nothing, day and night and day and night and dawn and dusk — few elements able to compose a meditative and lasting tableau of questions and feelings.\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work.\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 px x 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.com",

            "description": "This project began as an exploration of how human beings across all sorts of cultures respond in remarkably similar ways in terms of associating sounds with shapes.  That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",

            "description": "This token generates a deterministic set of minimal, abstract buildings of varying widths, heights, transparencies, and patterns, assembling a skyline view of your own unique imaginary city. Each city comes with its own randomized city day.\n\nEach mint has a native setting (Day or Night) which combined with the current time of viewing influences real-time movements of celestial bodies in your mint, e.g. on a mint with the Day setting, the sun will only appear when viewed during the day. The piece will re-render every minute.\n\nThe individual strokes of this token feature some of my latest developments of an algorithm that generatively simulates the texture of print imperfections. They are randomized at each render to give it a unique character. Note that depending on the complexity of each mint, some renders may introduce a brief pause. The aesthetics are greatly inspired by plotter art of early computer artists such as 'City Painting' by Grace C. Hertlein.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Nov 2021\nArtist: @Yazid",

            "description": "This project began as an exploration of how human beings across all sorts of cultures respond in remarkably similar ways in terms of associating sounds with shapes.  That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",

            "description": "Alexander Calder once said, “Well, the archaeologist will tell you there's a little bit of Miró in Calder and a little bit of Calder in Miró.” I feel there is a little of both Miró and Calder in these fanciful pieces. I have called the project, Wings, because I feel get it off the ground. The breakthrough came when I suddenly realized that instead of thinking in terms of lines, I needed to think a sense of flight as I look at them. And flight was the sensation I felt when the pieces of the project finally fell into place. While I have done several generative image compositions, this is my first piece of art to be fully algorithmic, and I struggled to in terms of parabolas.\n\nThe background color for each piece is randomly chosen, while the shapes are always black and the lines always white. As I developed the code, I experimented with several different approaches to color, but I kept coming back to this simple palette. It seemed to me to emphasize motion without distraction.\n\nThe drawing grid is divided randomly into 10 to 100 divisions. Each crosshair on the grid becomes a starting point for a mark, with these starting points chosen randomly as the code repeats a number of drawing loops. With these four random inputs - grid division, color, coordinate, and number of loops - the unique possibilities number in the hundreds of millions. A few are offered for your enjoyment here.\n\nI’d like to give a shout out to those who helped me in my fx(hash) learning curve. Thank you josemiguel.tez and Elout de Kok. I also leaned heavily and with gratitude on Rune Madson’s, Programming Design Systems (https://programmingdesignsystems.com), and on the supportive folks in the community Discord.\n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in Sept., 2022.\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nPress [S] in live mode to save with high-resolution.\n",

            "description": "Alexander Calder once said, “Well, the archaeologist will tell you there's a little bit of Miró in Calder and a little bit of Calder in Miró.” I feel there is a little of both Miró and Calder in these fanciful pieces. I have called the project, Wings, because I feel get it off the ground. The breakthrough came when I suddenly realized that instead of thinking in terms of lines, I needed to think a sense of flight as I look at them. And flight was the sensation I felt when the pieces of the project finally fell into place. While I have done several generative image compositions, this is my first piece of art to be fully algorithmic, and I struggled to in terms of parabolas.\n\nThe background color for each piece is randomly chosen, while the shapes are always black and the lines always white. As I developed the code, I experimented with several different approaches to color, but I kept coming back to this simple palette. It seemed to me to emphasize motion without distraction.\n\nThe drawing grid is divided randomly into 10 to 100 divisions. Each crosshair on the grid becomes a starting point for a mark, with these starting points chosen randomly as the code repeats a number of drawing loops. With these four random inputs - grid division, color, coordinate, and number of loops - the unique possibilities number in the hundreds of millions. A few are offered for your enjoyment here.\n\nI’d like to give a shout out to those who helped me in my fx(hash) learning curve. Thank you josemiguel.tez and Elout de Kok. I also leaned heavily and with gratitude on Rune Madson’s, Programming Design Systems (https://programmingdesignsystems.com), and on the supportive folks in the community Discord.\n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in Sept., 2022.\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nPress [S] in live mode to save with high-resolution.\n",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "A collaboration between leading British high-end audio brand KEF, generative artist hieroglyphica, and creative studio Parameta, Absorbed embodies the process of noise becoming high-fidelity sound through KEF’s Metamaterial Absorption Technology (MAT™). \n\nMAT™ makes the KEF sound what it is: absorbing unwanted distortion to deliver pure, accurate sound exactly as the artist intended. Inspired by this intricacy, Absorbed illustrates pseudorandom networks of patterns, slowly emerging and transforming into the maze-like form of MAT™. Clarity is revealed, noise is absorbed – high-fidelity is found.\n\nThe noise fields used in Absorbed are of two distinct types: conventional gradient noise and “sinusoidal” noise, an original algorithm developed for this series. The use of animation as artistic medium reflects the artists’ belief that no single frame can capture the full range of complexity found in the tension between sound and noise, and lets collectors observe for themselves this ever-shifting dialogue. A more extensive discussion of the algorithms used in Absorbed can be found in hieroglyphica’s companion article on fx(text).\n\n- spacebar will pause and resume the animation\n- s will save a still image of the current frame\n- technically minded collectors can consult the index.html file for info on how to render and save high-resolution images\n- use of hardware acceleration in Chrome may impact performance\n\nFounded by BBC engineer Raymond Cooke in 1961, KEF is a leading British innovator of high-end audio products including HiFi speakers, subwoofers, architectural speakers, wireless speaker-systems, and headphones.
