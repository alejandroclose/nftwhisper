According to the Law of Conservation of Matter, the total amount of matter in a closed system stays constant over time, only changing its form. Some living creatures have been luckier than others, as we can still find remnants of organisms from millions of years ago, serving as silent witnesses to mankind’s flourishing.\n\nYet, the human race is exploiting the planet at an unprecedented pace. We are depleting its resources, polluting its atmosphere, producing hazardous materials, disrupting the natural balance of all things. We are causing harm while still expecting the earth to nurture and delight us. We’re just a small dot on the timeline, and yet so much damage has been done.\n\nThrough this project, I humbly attempt to create imitations of fossils and other forms of natural matter. These made up forms may appear attractive, reminding us of nature, but what emotion would they evoke in a natureless world, built of concrete, iron, and plastic?\n\nWhat do we leave behind?\n\n\n___\n20% of the primary sales go directly to One Earth, non-profit organization working to counteract the climate crisis in multiple, innovative ways.\n\n___\nTechnical notes:\n\n- By default, an output image size is based on your browser size (x1.25, with a maximum of 1800) - The script is quite heavy, so it may take some time on higher resolutions (but it’s worth it)\n\nDesktop controls:\n- To change the output resolution, use [1..6] on your keyboard (1250..7200px, roughly A5..A0 print sizes on 300dpi) or [0] to restore the default \n- Press [S] to save the current image\n- Press [F] to switch fullscreen mode\n\nMobile controls:\n- Hold two fingers for 2s to save\n- Tap twice to switch fullscreen mode\n\nURL params\n- Add `&density=[number]` (0.5..1) to change calculated field’s density (default is 0.65)\n- Add `&size=[number]` (1..6) to render with desired resolution \n- Add `&save=1` to save image when ready\n\n___\nDeveloped in Javascript, using p5.js (2D Canvas) and chroma.js.\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n© February 2023, MadeUpLifeforms (mulf)\n",

            "description": "“Matriisi” is a generative artwork exploring the artistic, visual and conceptual possibilities of matrices in generative abstract art.\n\nIt is designed to be a digital artwork, to be viewed from a high quality monitor or tv, or printed and framed. Contemporary life is getting more and more digitalized and almost everyone has a device with a high resolution screen. With this artwork I am aiming to enable art collectors, traditional and digital, to have an artwork they can enjoy from their screen or tv, and save wall space for traditional hand made art objects.\n\nThe artwork is orientation agnostic, there is no preferred way it is supposed to be looked or hanged.\n \n\nThe artwork is based on set of number matrices used as main compositional structure. This data is then interpreted to draw the visual elements: matrices of lines and dots. As a play on digital vs handmade, lines and shapes imitating drawing highlight the forms made by the matrices. \n\nThere are 10 different colour palettes, that can be also mixed together. These colours draw inspiration from different eras and styles of art. \n\nAs the artwork is developed based on visual variety, there will are no separate features, as these would add limitations to the range of the generator.\n\n40 iterations are reserved for live minting in the gallery during the exhibition.\n\nMatriisi is shown in Luisa Catucci Gallery in Berlin between 1.9.2022 and 1.10.2022 in the generative art exhibition “Improbable Iterations” together with Joonas Toivonen aka Toiminto. He is showing his artwork “Fragment Assembler” also out on FX(Hash). Welcome to the opening of the exhibition on 1.9.2022 16-19pm @ Allerstraße 38, 12049, Berlin. Both artists will be present.\n\nControls in live view:\n-Pressing j exports the current image as jpeg\n-Pressing p exports the current image as png\n\nTo change the detail level one can access the pixel density of render by adding &pixDens=3 to the end of the URL in live view. You can of course put number other than 4 also. I it renders just a black image, you have to lower the number, since it is then too large for WEBGL to render.\n\n\nMade with p5.js\n\nAntti Pussinen, in Berlin 26.8. 2022\n",

            "description": "This project uses cellular automata where the state of a cell in a new generation is determined based on its own and its neighbors' states in the previous generation. The guiding rules for these transitions, however, are not static; they undergo a random change every few generations, chosen from a possible 256 rules. By also slightly shifting the positions of cells and using an outline and texture that conveys a hand-drawn style, I have tried introducing an element of organic randomness.\n\nStepping away from the monochromatic color scheme used in my last three series, I have used a gradient effect to convey a transitioning hue across generations, combining a palette of two colors selected from an array of 14 different palettes. \n\nNote on the name: The alternating rules and fluctuating cell positions serve as the apparent justification for its name. However, a subtler inspiration lies in my deep admiration for Franz Kafka and his remarkable short story, \"The Metamorphosis\". Kafka’s narrative explores the constantly evolving state of human existence, where patterns appear momentarily only to dissipate quickly. Just when you think you've spotted a pattern, poof, it changes. Just like in life, right :)\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

            "description": "This project uses cellular automata where the state of a cell in a new generation is determined based on its own and its neighbors' states in the previous generation. The guiding rules for these transitions, however, are not static; they undergo a random change every few generations, chosen from a possible 256 rules. By also slightly shifting the positions of cells and using an outline and texture that conveys a hand-drawn style, I have tried introducing an element of organic randomness.\n\nStepping away from the monochromatic color scheme used in my last three series, I have used a gradient effect to convey a transitioning hue across generations, combining a palette of two colors selected from an array of 14 different palettes. \n\nNote on the name: The alternating rules and fluctuating cell positions serve as the apparent justification for its name. However, a subtler inspiration lies in my deep admiration for Franz Kafka and his remarkable short story, \"The Metamorphosis\". Kafka’s narrative explores the constantly evolving state of human existence, where patterns appear momentarily only to dissipate quickly. Just when you think you've spotted a pattern, poof, it changes. Just like in life, right :)\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

The artwork is derived from an initial sketch of Bwople which, despite being not the one that was chosen, still managed to captivate interests. The project provides a unique glimpse into an alternate universe in which Bwople could have been represented.\n\nAll images are hand-drawn work by Gengoya and composed by Vector Recite using PureSpider's fxhash-pfp maker tool.\n\nTo download the full size image on fx(hash):\n- Click \"open\" below the image\n- Left click on the image, a \"Download image\" button will appear on the bottom right.\n- Click the \"Download image\" button.",

We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

The artwork is derived from an initial sketch of Bwople which, despite being not the one that was chosen, still managed to captivate interests. The project provides a unique glimpse into an alternate universe in which Bwople could have been represented.\n\nAll images are hand-drawn work by Gengoya and composed by Vector Recite using PureSpider's fxhash-pfp maker tool.\n\nTo download the full size image on fx(hash):\n- Click \"open\" below the image\n- Left click on the image, a \"Download image\" button will appear on the bottom right.\n- Click the \"Download image\" button.",
