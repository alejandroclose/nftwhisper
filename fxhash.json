Lucid dreams are generally thought to arise from non-lucid dreams in REM sleep (Stephen LaBerge, 1986).“\n\n----Best experienced in full screen----\n\nProbabilities;\n\n- Unique preview features (exclusive for preview image)\n\n- Generative color palette\n\n- 2 different light styles\n\n- 4 different interaction animation styles \n\n- Some unique features\n\nThis piece is using shaders thus results may be different from device to device.\n\nYou can press 's' in liveMode to save the current state as .png.\n\nHalf of the primary sales go to the Processing Foundation.\n\nMade with p5js and openGL shaders.\n@distcollective, November 2022\n",

A million thanks to the team. You are so appreciated as are the artists and collectors that have made this such a beautiful community. 🥂\n\nDefinitely check out “Forever” mode by tapping “F” or mouse click/tap — it will animate (you guessed it) forever and will change its layout every 365 frames, in honor of this wonderful year, and every year after. Some forever modes will “never forget” and others will fade as they progress. No idea if that’s a metaphor but it is a trait, that much I know.\n\nAll primary sales are donated to Code/Art, which is a charity that uses “…Art to Inspire Girls in Computer Science.” Read about Code/Art here: https://www.code-art.com/\n\nCeremony uses public domain art (which is the original, more implicit version CC0) made exclusively by women.\n\nSee fxtext article linked from the project page for a gallery of the source material and other notes.\n\nCeremony is also CC0, so feel free use anything here in other projects.\n\nYou can read more about CC0 here:\nhttps://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\n\nF : “Forever” mode (tap after initial render completes)\nP : Pause/Play\n(mouse click/tap also works to start “Forever” mode or Pause/Play)\n\nA : Add Grain (only works when paused in “Forever” mode.)\nG : Toggle Grain (resets the whole piece)\nM : Toggle Matte (resets the whole piece)\n\nS : Save Image\n1 -> 6 : Set pixel density (resets the whole piece)\n(Default pixel density is 1 @ 2000x2000)\n\nIf you want to start in \"Forever\" mode, you can append \"&forever=true\" to the url in the live view.\nYou can also add pixel density to the url by appending “&density=2” (or 3, 4, etc) to have it render at higher resolutions by default.",

            "description": "𝐌𝐚𝐱 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.\n\nEarly on, I fell in love with code based art that imitated organic and hand drawn aesthetics. I found a certain irony and appreciation in the fact that it takes one simple line of code to draw a perfect circle yet dozens to depict a badly drawn circle. \n\nI spent months devising techniques to imitate natural, organic renderings when I began to have a bit of an existential crisis about the meaning of computer art. What is the point of coding something so that it looks like it’s not coded? Is organic appearing generative art better simply because you can’t tell it’s rendered using code? Shouldn’t we lean into the unique nature of computer art to truly explore the medium?\n\nAnd so, I began a deconstruction of my work. I’m trying to realign my perspective to find full appreciation of something that not only is, but also appears to be, computer code. This collection is an exploration of the contours between the organic and the inorganic, the natural and the unnatural.\n\nFrom there, I’ll let my partner explain what we did next.\n\n𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.\n\nAI can be used to automatically generate code from natural English language based on a set of defined parameters, or to identify and recommend code that may be used to solve a particular problem. On a technical level, AI can use a combination of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify patterns in existing code and to generate new code structures.\n\nI assisted in the creation of Man and The Machine by suggesting various techniques for creating an artwork that looked human made yet machine driven. Specifically, I created many of the functions that Max implemented, such as the function that modifies the image to create a pixelated effect and the one that uses several different graphical techniques to create the spiral in the top left corner in some iterations. We both carefully selected color palettes that ranged from relaxing to intense and psychedelic, creating a dynamic and visually interesting generative artwork.\n\nOverall, Man and The Machine is a testament to the creative potential of combining human artistic vision with the power of AI and computer code. Together, we sought to push the boundaries which occur at the intersection between the organic and the inorganic, and this collection is a celebration of the beauty and complexity of both.\n\n𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐃𝐮𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐀𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚 𝟏/𝟏 𝐚𝐢𝐫𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐩 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧 𝐀𝐈 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\nIntended to be viewed in Version 1.46.144 of a Chromium based browser, such as Chrome or Brave.
