Each mint generates half of two cube forms, and each half is assigned random hues (in multiples of 10, from 0 to 360). Collectively as a project, this token challenges the approach of looking for \"rarities\" in a new way. How the cubes are rendered leaves the possibility for multiple mints to potentially join up on the sides with colors that perfect match each other.

Too much of a person is defined by random chance. The country they were born in, the financial situation of their family, even their genetics. If someone was unlucky and has low natural IQ, they can't change it. And it affects their life significantly. If someone was born in a poor country or family, it might be extremely harder to get a good education, and later, a well-paying job. Some people are fortunate enough to get a headstart, while others aren't so lucky.\n\nThe only way for everyone to be truly equal would be identical starting conditions, and that's utterly impossible to achieve.",

            "description": "The preparations for the first mission began in 2142. It had become clear that mining petroleum on Earth would soon become financially unfeasible, so looking to other planets was the only logical choice. It took seventeen more years to perfect the technology so that the first colonists could reach Proxima b within the lifetime of one generation.\n\nAfter 45 years of travelling at almost one-tenth of the speed of light, they reached their new home. It was rich in petrochemicals but scarce in the nutrients necessary for long term human survival. After merely six generations, humanity was forced to travel once again in search of a new world. The four missions that parted from the Proxima system to colonise other possibly habitable planets in the galaxy sparked a new age of human civilisation that would never see itself united and thriving again.\n\nEventually, all the colonies became independent societies as their differing interests drove them apart. Each small civilisation chose its path, wandering the void of space alone. Over time, millions of kilometres apart, each colony developed its own culture and traditions. While their habits and customs changed, some things remained the same across all the societies, like how it became a certain tradition to convert the outer world years and days to Earth time and celebrate holidays according to the calendar of the old world.\n\nThe new nomads learned from the first pilgrims. They used the technology once optimised for oil extraction to traverse other worlds, searching for sustenance. Peculiar wandering nonspaces emerged from the involuntary degrowth of human civilisation.\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

            "description": "The preparations for the first mission began in 2142. It had become clear that mining petroleum on Earth would soon become financially unfeasible, so looking to other planets was the only logical choice. It took seventeen more years to perfect the technology so that the first colonists could reach Proxima b within the lifetime of one generation.\n\nAfter 45 years of travelling at almost one-tenth of the speed of light, they reached their new home. It was rich in petrochemicals but scarce in the nutrients necessary for long term human survival. After merely six generations, humanity was forced to travel once again in search of a new world. The four missions that parted from the Proxima system to colonise other possibly habitable planets in the galaxy sparked a new age of human civilisation that would never see itself united and thriving again.\n\nEventually, all the colonies became independent societies as their differing interests drove them apart. Each small civilisation chose its path, wandering the void of space alone. Over time, millions of kilometres apart, each colony developed its own culture and traditions. While their habits and customs changed, some things remained the same across all the societies, like how it became a certain tradition to convert the outer world years and days to Earth time and celebrate holidays according to the calendar of the old world.\n\nThe new nomads learned from the first pilgrims. They used the technology once optimised for oil extraction to traverse other worlds, searching for sustenance. Peculiar wandering nonspaces emerged from the involuntary degrowth of human civilisation.\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

Who would care to seek out lifeless lands lost in the cosmos?\n\nAny civilization capable of such reconnaissance might seem above the little hope that barren lands may bring. Unless, of course, there is a hope of answering the most desperate of needs: Finding a New Home.\n\nWere these images captured by humans on Earth, or on Mars, or somewhere even further away in distance and probability? Maybe they’re recon from another planet’s civilization — one that shares our struggle to find true harmony with the world they have.\n\nInspired by the remarkable satellite imagery in the compendium “This is Mars,” Reconnaissance suggests what may lie outside our habitable lands — and that we risk missing what's already here while being compelled to look further and further for what’s next.\n\n\nChoose a resolution (1-6) by adding \"&scale=4\" to the URL in live view.\nCreated with p5.js\n\nTENDER x Nat Sarkissian\nMay 2022",

            "description": "For my first drop on the new fxhash v1.0 I wanted to make something different. So I challenged myself to write a raymarcher like the ones I use in my shaders but in p5.js and make a fully procedural scene with it. It's a bit tricky to work with vectors once you are used to GLSL, but I managed to write a decent algorithm that scans a grid and slowly draws the image. It draws it with circles and triangles for the grass. The first thing I used for testing was a SDF of a plane with some tall bars on it. Then I was trying different distortions on the shapes and in one moment the results gave me the idea of a scene with mushrooms and grass on an undulated terrain. Later I added a small river and a cloudy sky. I think I was inadvertently inspired by some children's books I had when I was a kid. \n\nBest viewed full screen.\n\nFeatures:\n\nMood: happy - normal - melancholic - strange - sleepy\nMushrooms: 2 - 4 (sometimes one of the mushrooms can only be seen on full screen)\nMushroom height: short - medium - tall\nMushroom fatness: S - M - L - XL\nMushroom shape: 1 - 2 - 3- 4 - 5\nMushroom tilt\nFlowers color: white - yellow - pink - cyan - multicolor\nRiver: yes - no\nCamera orientation: north - south",
