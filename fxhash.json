It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\nüëì thousands of different outputs are possible\nüë®‚Äçüíª only code\nüé® 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \nüé• animated\nüñ±Ô∏è interactive (+controls for mobile)\nüòé augmented reality view\nüü• different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\nüñºÔ∏è save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\nüìº save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress ‚Äú5‚Äù to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú6‚Äù to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú7‚Äù to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú8‚Äù to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress ‚ÄúArrowDown‚Äù for restores the original camera view\nPress ‚ÄúD‚Äù to switch to next composition\nPress ‚ÄúA‚Äù to switch  to previous composition\nPress ‚ÄúS‚Äù to start animation\nPress ‚ÄúSpacebar‚Äù to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú1‚Äù to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú2‚Äù to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú3‚Äù to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention! Thanks for the support! Thanks for the opportunity fxhash and genart community! I hope I was able to contribute to generative art with my work!\n\n@C4RC0\ncarco.hu",

The hidden secrets of these Ordinary Places can only be revealed through the minting process. In this sense, the outputs are not merely a collection individual scenes, but instead, a coherent world animated by shared themes and narratives.     \n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",

Composed in 1913, these are genuine children‚Äôs pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n‚ÄúEnfantines II. Enfantillages Pittoresques‚Äù is the second of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. ‚ÄúEnfantillages Pittoresques‚Äù experiments with predefined plots, colour blending, webgl shaders, and generative music; all with a fresh, childish style. This algorithm has been trained to draw basic shapes in accordance to Satie‚Äôs lyrics. However, it uses them in unusual ways and creates what looks like fantastic creatures, microscopic beings, or, to follow Corneille, Constant, and Appel: \"human animals\".\n\n‚ÄúIt took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child‚Äù Attributed to Picasso (falsely, probably)\n\nWith two modes that won‚Äôt produce the same outputs, ‚ÄúEnfantines‚Äù are best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie‚Äôs piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, these have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\nPress M or Double Tap (mobile) for AUDIO mode\nWait for SILENT mode\nPress I for Trait Info (desktop)\nPress 1 for Canvas Save (desktop)\n\nIntroduce ‚Äú?pixelDensity=171‚Äù after URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\nIntroduce ‚Äú?pixelDensity=X‚Äù for HQ renders (standard is 2, and 8 produces 400ppi 40x44cm prints).\n\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe ‚ÄúEnfantines‚Äù are educational algorithms.

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. \nwww.tribute-hwf.com\n\n‚ÄúOne criterion for art involves the process used by the artist for shaping the work. In the special case of mathematically supported fine art, the artmaking process occurs in a mathematically defined operation that allows the generation and transformation of images, methods used for picture processing.‚Äù - Herbert W. Franke\n\nI first came across Franke‚Äôs ‚ÄòOrnamental Alphabets‚Äô in his book ùòäùò∞ùòÆùò±ùò∂ùòµùò¶ùò≥ ùòéùò≥ùò¢ùò±ùò©ùò™ùò§ùò¥ - ùòäùò∞ùòÆùò±ùò∂ùòµùò¶ùò≥ ùòàùò≥ùòµ, and was intrigued with the idea of using a simple letterform to explore different generative image processing techniques. \n\nI‚Äôve used letters and writing in my work for a long time, both with letterpress printing and in my asemic poetry programs. With asemic writing, I generate unrecognizable letters to reference text, and here I use recognizable letterforms removed from their typical function as language signifiers. \n\nMy goal with this project was to build as much texture and layering as possible by warping and collaging the letters together in various ways. The font I‚Äôm using is a design I made years ago to supplement my wood type collection for printing. I really enjoyed being able to bring that part of my past work into my generative art practice. \n\nEach image is composed of the letters found in the hash for that piece, divided into either vowels or consonants. The program builds on a technique I‚Äôve used before, where I generate an image to an off-screen canvas and then dive through the pixels to pull out the color and form I want to surface in the final image.\n\n25% of the primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke. These funds will be used by ZKM Karlsruhe to digitize Franke‚Äôs 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any additional funds raised will be donated to the R√ºtgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n- Press ‚ÄúR‚Äù to increase the pixel density and reload the image (this can be render intensive and will create a really large file suitable for printing)\n- Press ‚ÄúS‚Äù to save a copy\n\nMade with p5js\nArtist: Sarah Ridgley\nOctober, 2022",

            "description": "After 4 months of coding the Generative Glasses is ready! I gained a lot of experience along the way and I really liked the creation process.\n\nI wrote an article in which I report on the creation process in more detail. It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\nüëì thousands of different outputs are possible\nüë®‚Äçüíª only code\nüé® 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \nüé• animated\nüñ±Ô∏è interactive (+controls for mobile)\nüòé augmented reality view\nüü• different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\nüñºÔ∏è save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\nüìº save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress ‚Äú5‚Äù to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú6‚Äù to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú7‚Äù to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú8‚Äù to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress ‚ÄúArrowDown‚Äù for restores the original camera view\nPress ‚ÄúD‚Äù to switch to next composition\nPress ‚ÄúA‚Äù to switch  to previous composition\nPress ‚ÄúS‚Äù to start animation\nPress ‚ÄúSpacebar‚Äù to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú1‚Äù to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú2‚Äù to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú3‚Äù to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention! Thanks for the support! Thanks for the opportunity fxhash and genart community! I hope I was able to contribute to generative art with my work!\n\n@C4RC0\ncarco.hu",

Link at the bottom. If you‚Äôd rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that‚Äôs present. \n\n../‚Äô`*‚Äô`\\../‚Äô`*‚Äô`\\../‚Äô`*‚Äô`\\../‚Äô`*‚Äô`\\../‚Äô`*‚Äô`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying ‚Äúdone‚Äù for 4 seconds when it‚Äôs ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won‚Äôt need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. \nwww.tribute-hwf.com\n\n‚ÄúOne criterion for art involves the process used by the artist for shaping the work. In the special case of mathematically supported fine art, the artmaking process occurs in a mathematically defined operation that allows the generation and transformation of images, methods used for picture processing.‚Äù - Herbert W. Franke\n\nI first came across Franke‚Äôs ‚ÄòOrnamental Alphabets‚Äô in his book ùòäùò∞ùòÆùò±ùò∂ùòµùò¶ùò≥ ùòéùò≥ùò¢ùò±ùò©ùò™ùò§ùò¥ - ùòäùò∞ùòÆùò±ùò∂ùòµùò¶ùò≥ ùòàùò≥ùòµ, and was intrigued with the idea of using a simple letterform to explore different generative image processing techniques. \n\nI‚Äôve used letters and writing in my work for a long time, both with letterpress printing and in my asemic poetry programs. With asemic writing, I generate unrecognizable letters to reference text, and here I use recognizable letterforms removed from their typical function as language signifiers. \n\nMy goal with this project was to build as much texture and layering as possible by warping and collaging the letters together in various ways. The font I‚Äôm using is a design I made years ago to supplement my wood type collection for printing. I really enjoyed being able to bring that part of my past work into my generative art practice. \n\nEach image is composed of the letters found in the hash for that piece, divided into either vowels or consonants. The program builds on a technique I‚Äôve used before, where I generate an image to an off-screen canvas and then dive through the pixels to pull out the color and form I want to surface in the final image.\n\n25% of the primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke. These funds will be used by ZKM Karlsruhe to digitize Franke‚Äôs 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any additional funds raised will be donated to the R√ºtgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n- Press ‚ÄúR‚Äù to increase the pixel density and reload the image (this can be render intensive and will create a really large file suitable for printing)\n- Press ‚ÄúS‚Äù to save a copy\n\nMade with p5js\nArtist: Sarah Ridgley\nOctober, 2022",

            "description": "Schwere See\n(...which is german for \"Heavy Seas\")\n\nthis work creates completely generative ocean worlds between the real and the surreal.\nwhat is real? when do we feel reality? i guess as with many other things, we feel reality best when we're deprived of it.\nThat might be the reason why it never ceases to fascinate us to both exaggerate and abstract nature and reality - maybe even at the same time.\nthat's where this work tries to go...\ngiving my best to create realistic looking waves out of hmm... thin electron-gas..., and then disrupt those from realism by unnaturally exaggerating waveforms and abstracting the display to a few colors and lines - ...well, not so few of the latter, actually ;-)\n\nbeware: this needs a good GPU (at least here in 2023) to properly run in realtime.\nstills can still be rendered on a low end machine with on-board graphics, but for realtime playing you'd need some proper dedicated graphics card.\nand of course it wont run fast (or maybe not all) on your mobile phone (except maybe on a very high end device).\n\nthe different mints vary in wave shape, color, camera view, animation speed, aspect ratio, frame style, hatching density, field of view, and more.\nsome color schemes are based on pre-chosen palettes (slightly varied though), but others are wildly random-generated. there's always some risk in randomness, but lets give the error some chance to surprise us - this is one of the many benefits of generative art.\n\nas generative art can do so much more than just generate/show an image i feel almost obliged to add the possibility to animate/inteact.\nhowever, this extra control shall not be chosen without some considerations. \nyou don't want a strobingly wild animation above your fireplace or in a doctors waiting room. nor is it motion-wise very inspiring to have subtle image stills hanging in a dancefloor.\nso, by default when in animation mode (<space>-key) the scene is very slowly and steadily changing - some pieces faster, some slower. however, by pressing <f> you can toggle to a sped up animation of waves, clouds, and scene rotation.\nbtw, going faster in nav-mode also speeds up the wave animation. (...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

            "description": "INSPIRATION\n\nSpirali was inspired by Tyler Hobbs' work with flow fields. However, instead of selecting random starting points for each shape to be drawn, which is more usual in flow fields works, I wanted to constrain the starting points to certain positions so that the shape being drawn could expand freely without the risk of colliding with other shapes, that's when I got to the spiral flow field.\n\nWHY SPIRALI?\n\nThe name of this collection is not only a direct translation of spirals in Italian, but it is also related to Italian cuisine and my own personal experience in Italy. The relationship with Italian cuisine is due to the immense number of types of pasta that exist, including one called spirali. When I was a child I only knew three or four types of pasta, but when I became a bit older I was amazed to learn that there were many more. Actually, there are hundreds. Just like from the same type of basic dough, you can make hundreds of types of pasta, my idea was, from just one type of spiral flow field, to make hundreds of images. A strategy of forcing creativity by imposing a major constraint.\n\nThe name of this collection also relates to my personal experience because it was visiting Italy many years ago that I first became interested in art and design because of the beautiful buildings, churches and works of art that I came across.\n\nDESIGN STRATEGY\n\nA spirali is made up of several tails and each tail is made up of a basic element, which I called slice. A tail may have from one to thousands slices. It is mainly the variation in the number of slices and how they are colored that creates the different tail styles in each spirali.\n\nThe slices start at the center of the spiral and in each iteration they grow a certain length or split in two depending on the parameters used in the algorithm, which also determine the outline and fill of each slice when it is rendered.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe main features that a spirali can have are:\n\n- Styles: Refers to the drawing patterns of each tail, that means, the shape, fill and stroke of the slices that form the tail. There are about 16 possible styles from which the algorithm will choose about 3 for each spirali.\n\n- Zoom out: It is related to how much larger the flow field area is in comparison to the image area. There are two possibilities: 50% and 100%.\n\n- Curvature: An arbitrary measure of the rate the tails of a spirali are turning. A spirali can have high or low curvature.\n\n- Rotation: The rotation direction: clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n- Tails: The number of tails in a spirali.\n\n- Palette: The palette's name. There are about 14 possible palettes.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n\n- Press \"m\" to export a medium resolution image (2000px x 2000px);\n- Press \"h\" to export a high resolution image (6000px x 6000px);\n\nLICENSING\n\nPlease see license.txt file.\n\nTwitter: @PauloSilvaGArt\nSite: https://paulosilva.art",

As natural as a digital gift can be. It is a gen art token of my gratitude you might say. It is the younger sibling of \"The Spectrum of Nature\". \n\nThis is a gift from me to you, a gift of nature that pulls you through. \n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nTo know more about the concept and technicalities of this piece, see the fxtext article ‚ÄúThe spectrum of nature - a short making of‚Äù. However, feel free to skip the article.\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nBasic info:\nThe initial render will be 1000px wide and 1000px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that‚Äôs present.\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x2000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x9000 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won‚Äôt need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",
