            "description": "\"Earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do.\" – Unknown\n\nEarthquakes are not just natural disasters, but also human tragedies. They can strike suddenly and violently, leaving behind a trail of destruction and trauma that can last a lifetime. For survivors, the experience of an earthquake can be life changing.\n\nHomes and neighborhoods are reduced to rubble, and the familiar landmarks and memories of a lifetime are wiped away in an instant. In the aftermath of an earthquake, survivors must grapple with the emotional toll of their loss, the uncertainty of the future, and the challenge of rebuilding their lives.\n\nThe first step after a disaster is to provide emergency medical care, shelter, and basic necessities like food and water. Once these immediate needs are met, attention can turn to assessing the damage and developing a plan for reconstruction.\n\nThe rebuilding process can be a long and challenging journey, as it involves not only repairing physical damage but also restoring the social fabric of affected communities, addressing issues like housing, infrastructure, and economic recovery, as well as addressing the psychological and emotional impact of the disaster on individuals and communities.\n\nIt is crucial to rebuild using proper techniques and investing in the right resources to prevent similar disasters from happening in the future. Reconstruction must be done with a focus on resilience, sustainability, and safety. This means taking into consideration the local conditions, the latest research on earthquake-resistant materials and designs, and the needs of the affected communities.\n\nThe cost of not investing in proper reconstruction after an earthquake can be immense. Poorly constructed buildings and infrastructure can increase the risk of further damage in the event of another earthquake, leading to more loss of life and property. On the other hand, investing in proper reconstruction can help create a safer and more resilient environment, reducing the impact of future earthquakes and protecting the lives and livelihoods of those who call the affected region home.\n\nFor this reason, it is crucial that regions impacted by earthquakes receive immediate and adequate economic and technical support, and that available resources are managed with proper planning and great responsibility.\n\nThis generative art project explores the destructive power of earthquakes and seeks to capture the raw emotions of those who have experienced earthquakes and the transformation of their world into a memory.\n\n100% of the primary split is going to @tezquakeaid, Tezos community initiative providing aid to the victims of the catastrophic earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, 2023. \nOnce again the Tezos community has proven to be special. 💚\n\nHand coded after midnight.\nPowered by p5, matter & chroma.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\nThe generation takes some time but you can see the simulation and drawing process happening in real-time.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters and pressing the following keys, the artwork will regenerate at a different scale:\n\n- 1 -> 1.920x1.080\n- 2 -> 4.000x2.252\n- 3 -> 6.000x3.378\n- 4 -> 8.000x4.504\n\n=============> MAKING OF <=============\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/article/the-making-of-mercalli",

Each artist has 5 Artworks in this collection, which have been randomly combined with Borders that I designed (Morteza Yousefi, idea owner and art director)\nI designed the borders in such a way that by combining them, we find Unique borders that can be minimal or complex, or abstract.\n\nThis combination has got a beautiful effect in a random way, and besides that, this collection is very valuable because of the reputation and Ideas of the 25 artists and the Collaboration of 25 Artists.\n\nThe number of Traits in this collection is 7 (176 layers) and it has the ability to make 60,963,840 unique NFTs.\n\nTo create balance, these NFTs are randomly minted, and this is a chance for everyone to get a rare version. So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\n\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\n🟧🟦🟧🟧\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nMade in 2023\n\n🟧🟦🟧🟧\n\nCollaborators Twitter :\n@Morteza_Yousefy\n@ShagaONhan\n@PixeliusArt\n@ardavan_\n@Bonyvxl\n@mo0n_zi\n@Alireza_f_z\n@negar_khozhandi\n@MontazeriAmin\n@Gunnwik1\n@_iaM_Mina\n@mahdirezafathi\n@rishehri_h\n@ma_khalaji\n@Rezvan_jj\n@v_valimohammadi\n@nillgraphic\n@tsaibaba88\n@HeleDesignnft\n@iSteef\n@Raven_slb\n@marzieh_fazeli\n@borok_studio\n@ehsan_special\n@happyfamily1985\n\n",
