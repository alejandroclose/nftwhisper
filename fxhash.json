            "description": "Through extensive lobbying, Disney helped change copyright law through the Copyright Term Extension Act to keep Mickey's earliest incarnation, Steamboat Willie, out of the public domain for an extra 20 years. While copyright law often protects artists, it shouldn't last forever. Thankfully, more hybridized forms of protection such as Creative Commons licenses have emerged allowing for protection as well as remixes and reimaginations. \n\nWith Steamboat Willie now in the public domain, this collection builds upon Willie (and Disney's) nightmare of all sorts of off-brand chaos inflicted upon his form, transforming Mickey from an icon of family-friendly magic to one of nightmarish capitalism, sexual freedom, and murder run rampant. \n\nNo commentary on the clash of capitalism and art would be complete without making this an open edition with a treasure hunt of trait pairings. The hunt will last as long as the open edition (two weeks), and after that, prizes shall be airdropped. \n\nFor more information and to claim prizes, please join the House of Mors Discord: https://discord.gg/3N2KBfUuAN\n\nThanks to PureSpider for the image composition tool.

            "description": "Errance - an exploration of abstract and digital glitch fusion. The algorithm crafts the concept and structure, while randomness navigates the detailed textures, exploring the interplay between systematic design and the unforeseen aspects of randomness. Errance represents a journey of discovery, one without a defined endpoint, capturing the unexpected and fortuitous outcomes that emerge as algorithms navigate freely, leaving a trail of unique and unpredictable patterns.\n\nBest experienced in live mode at high resolution, the outputs vary significantly due to multiple features, occasionally favouring a slightly asymmetric balance. Under the hood, the algorithm employs a combination of recursive functions, 3D primitives, and multiple textures derived from trigonometric and noise functions using p5.js. Last but not least, during rendering, the outputs are enhanced by one of several versions of a GLSL shader.\n\nIn live mode:\n-press 1 to save a 2K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 2 for a 4K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 3 to render a version without passepartout.\n-press 4 for a 2k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.\n-press 5 for a 4k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.",

            "description": "The Visible Manifestation of Invisible Forces\n\n“Fantasies of the past determined by needs of the present have a direct impact on realities of the future.” –– Svetlana Boym\n\n\nThis series continues my explorations into generative abstract expressionism, building on the techniques and approaches of my previous works “THE400FLIPS” and “a fortiori.” This time viewers can interact with the piece by adding more particles onto the canvas, effectively altering the behaviour set by the transaction hash —a collaboration between the artist, chance, and the collector. \n\nArt is fantastic and induces fantasies: This is one of those cases where the art is more than the thumbnail. I encourage you to run the code and interact with the canvas. As you alter the outputs, you will experience them as fleeting moments. Seen and gone, unless you are fast enough to catch them as we do with photographs: use the spacebar to pause the animation, then save a png image file by pressing “s”.\n\nConsider each reload and interaction a new simulation of life.\n\n\nThis work is, at its core, an implementation of Craig Reynolds’s Boids program to simulate the flocking behaviour of birds. As such, the flocking parts used in this work are released under the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nControls:\n[s] Save as PNG.\n[spacebar] or [x][z] Pause/Play.\n[Click and drag] Add more particles to the canvas.\n\n\nSoundtrack:\nI curated a Spotify soundtrack to accompany the work. Enjoy:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Nn2dM4cLqOukBDcryKk1d?si=cc48c678e6f34c2b\n\n\nNotes:\nCreated with p5.js and GLSL – optimised for Chrome – designed to be experienced on a desktop computer.\n\nThe preview capture module uses GPU instances. It may take time for thumbnails to appear. \n\n\nWarning:\nIt contains flashing lights and colours that may affect people with visual sensitivities.\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2023 Thomas Noya\n\n◉_◉",

            "description": "Through extensive lobbying, Disney helped change copyright law through the Copyright Term Extension Act to keep Mickey's earliest incarnation, Steamboat Willie, out of the public domain for an extra 20 years. While copyright law often protects artists, it shouldn't last forever. Thankfully, more hybridized forms of protection such as Creative Commons licenses have emerged allowing for protection as well as remixes and reimaginations. \n\nWith Steamboat Willie now in the public domain, this collection builds upon Willie (and Disney's) nightmare of all sorts of off-brand chaos inflicted upon his form, transforming Mickey from an icon of family-friendly magic to one of nightmarish capitalism, sexual freedom, and murder run rampant. \n\nNo commentary on the clash of capitalism and art would be complete without making this an open edition with a treasure hunt of trait pairings. The hunt will last as long as the open edition (two weeks), and after that, prizes shall be airdropped. \n\nFor more information and to claim prizes, please join the House of Mors Discord: https://discord.gg/3N2KBfUuAN\n\nThanks to PureSpider for the image composition tool.

Although mass-produced using paper stencils, the artisans painted by hand, resulting in variations in the quality of their work.

Otsu-e showed a new value of beauty in Japanese art, different from Ukiyo-e (浮世絵) which are prints, and from fine art paintings which are one-of-a-kind artworks.\n\nThis work is made of canvas2D Bezier curves. Not just a combination of parts, but also a random displacement of the Bezier curve points to lose the shape. This is intended to create fun with the Otsu-e-like effect.\n\n\nFeatures:\nThis profile is made up of 8 parts (brows, eyes, nose, mouth, ear, contour, hair, and body). Each part has 100 basic types. \nThere are 7 skin colors and 12 kimono colors. Each RGB value of the colors is randomly added within a range of ±10. In addition, there are 70 kimono patterns. \nThe distortion rate due to displacement of Bezier curve points is 0.0~50.0. \n\n\nBTW The title \"Henoheno\" is taken from the Japanese character picture \"Henohenomoheji\" known since the Edo period.",

Although mass-produced using paper stencils, the artisans painted by hand, resulting in variations in the quality of their work.

Otsu-e showed a new value of beauty in Japanese art, different from Ukiyo-e (浮世絵) which are prints, and from fine art paintings which are one-of-a-kind artworks.\n\nThis work is made of canvas2D Bezier curves. Not just a combination of parts, but also a random displacement of the Bezier curve points to lose the shape. This is intended to create fun with the Otsu-e-like effect.\n\n\nFeatures:\nThis profile is made up of 8 parts (brows, eyes, nose, mouth, ear, contour, hair, and body). Each part has 100 basic types. \nThere are 7 skin colors and 12 kimono colors. Each RGB value of the colors is randomly added within a range of ±10. In addition, there are 70 kimono patterns. \nThe distortion rate due to displacement of Bezier curve points is 0.0~50.0. \n\n\nBTW The title \"Henoheno\" is taken from the Japanese character picture \"Henohenomoheji\" known since the Edo period.",

Otsu-e showed a new value of beauty in Japanese art, different from Ukiyo-e (浮世絵) which are prints, and from fine art paintings which are one-of-a-kind artworks.\n\nThis work is made of canvas2D Bezier curves. Not just a combination of parts, but also a random displacement of the Bezier curve points to lose the shape. This is intended to create fun with the Otsu-e-like effect.\n\n\nFeatures:\nThis profile is made up of 8 parts (brows, eyes, nose, mouth, ear, contour, hair, and body). Each part has 100 basic types. \nThere are 7 skin colors and 12 kimono colors. Each RGB value of the colors is randomly added within a range of ±10. In addition, there are 70 kimono patterns. \nThe distortion rate due to displacement of Bezier curve points is 0.0~50.0. \n\n\nBTW The title \"Henoheno\" is taken from the Japanese character picture \"Henohenomoheji\" known since the Edo period.",
