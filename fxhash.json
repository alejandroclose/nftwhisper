Note that the image will change to fit the new size, but overall drawing style, colors, etc. will remain the same.\n(For example, for a 1000x2000 image, add &x=1000&y=2000)\n---------------\nteaboswell 2022\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0, See bundle.js.LICENSE.txt for third party license information\n10% of primary sales will be donated to Girls Who Code (https://girlswhocode.com)",

Different species evolve and interact together, resulting in stabilizing patterns out of their parametric configurations. A form of artificial life.\n\nThis work is based on the paper \"Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks\", written by Jeff Jones and popularized in the artistic field by Sage Jenson. Some features were added to increase the visual and behavioral complexity of the system. Agents are divided into different species, with their own set of rules and interacting with their own substrate. Substrates also interact with each other and agents will mutate in contact of some of them.\n\nNFT License\nRuns properly on Chrome 97.0.4692.99\nGPU intensive\n\nPress P to pause (double tab touch devices)\nPress",

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. www.tribute-hwf.com\n\n\"Since the classical age of Greece, the golden ratio has been well known as the most balanced and therefore most aesthetically perfect proportion. In fact, it is supposedly often found in the fine arts and architecture and it is certainly important in geometry. But where is the proof that it is really the most beautiful proportion?\n\n\"The computer is proving to be a useful tool in exact art theory. Works of computer art are produced with the help of programs that describe the logic of the construction and its relevant measures. By varying the parameters you can vary the shapes of objects, and on the basis of the reaction of the public you can determine the best option. So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n\"A statistical evaluation would be interesting. Please email me with your results for the optimal proportion.\"\n\nI found it heartwarming that in 2011, Herbert W. Franke wrote the above, accompanied with a simple functional program on a Wolfram Demonstration page (https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/IsTheGoldenRatioReallyTheMostBeautifulProportion/) titled 'Is the Golden Ratio Really the Most Beautiful Proportion?' and invited people to submit their findings to him.\n\nThe main idea behind this project is ratios, a variety of them, used in a variety of ways, such as how a rectangle is repeatedly subdivided, or how it influences the aspect ratio of the piece, or how the colors in a palette are selected. These are represented in various styles, some of which are inspired by the aesthetic of Herbert W. Franke's diverse artworks, and his openness to experimentation with new technologies, such as plotter drawings, screens, screenprints, or 2D and 3D digital renderings.\n\nThis project, while not designed to be a formal statistical evaluation, is but my fun, colorful, and humble response to your inquiry, dear Herbert.\n\n---\n\n25% of primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke, with the goal of raising 20,000 Euros so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any money raised beyond this goal will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• Double-click/tap or 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n\nNote: Some mints require WEBGL and/or may take several seconds to fully render.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid",

The p5.js sketch has up to 172 different \"mound\" illustrations to pick from to build the scene.⁠\n⁠\nPlease be patient. It will take a few seconds for the scene to render; a lot is going on under the hood.⁠ The sketch will load in layers, and the console will log \"Done rendering!\" when the whole scene is done loading.\n⁠\nThis token was handmade with pens, markers, ink, and p5.js.⁠\n⁠\nI drew these squiggles between August 29th - September 6th, 2022, with a combination of pens, markers, and brushes in various sketchbooks. The sketches are scanned and separated in Photoshop.⁠\n\nI hope you enjoy this mint as much as I did making it! See https://natenolting.com/2022/09/06/mounds-3/ for more details on this project.\n\nExport to a PNG format at several different sizes.\n- Press s: save the current render size\n- Press t: scale to screen size\n- Press f: scale to print size @ 3000px x 3000px",

            "description": "\"Mounds 3\" is part of an ongoing series of experiments combining hand-drawn \"mounds\" and turning them into something unexpected. The p5.js sketch has up to 172 different \"mound\" illustrations to pick from to build the scene.⁠\n⁠\nPlease be patient. It will take a few seconds for the scene to render; a lot is going on under the hood.⁠ The sketch will load in layers, and the console will log \"Done rendering!\" when the whole scene is done loading.\n⁠\nThis token was handmade with pens, markers, ink, and p5.js.⁠\n⁠\nI drew these squiggles between August 29th - September 6th, 2022, with a combination of pens, markers, and brushes in various sketchbooks. The sketches are scanned and separated in Photoshop.⁠\n\nI hope you enjoy this mint as much as I did making it! See https://natenolting.com/2022/09/06/mounds-3/ for more details on this project.\n\nExport to a PNG format at several different sizes.\n- Press s: save the current render size\n- Press t: scale to screen size\n- Press f: scale to print size @ 3000px x 3000px",

            "description": "Toccata is a piece about decay, about the impermanent. The emergence over time or, rather, progression of entropy is a key characteristic of our universe. Everything evolves to nothing. We as mortal beings have sometimes trouble reconciling with this idea. Humans have sought immortality for millennia, be it through ancient potions or modern medicine, be it from leaving a legacy that we feel will stand the test of time. It will, only to decay later than us.\n\nToccata is a piece about change. Change lies at the heart of human cognition and human nature. Our thoughts and our emotions happen over time, and are a function of the change that is both around us and at the very core of our selves. Change comes in nature in cycles. Seasons of growth, seasons of ripe fruits of life, seasons of decay, of death, rebirth.\n\nToccata is music. We find music to convey some of the deepest streams of human condition, connecting it to some other form of being. Music also happens over time, and music happens because of change. Music encodes our feelings better than any other aid we may have. Toccata incorporates this at its very core, as the main sound is Andreas' family piano where he learned to play, sampled this past July.\n\nRead more about the piece, and the collaboration between Marcelo and Andreas on andreasrau.eu/toccata\n\n---\n\nBasic controls:\n- Click on the piece or press spacebar to start it (WebAudio requires user intervention for the music to start). Once the music has started, again click or press spacebar to play/pause.\n- Press “s” to save a still at the current resolution\n- Press “r” to start recording a video at the current resolution, then “r” again to stop.\n\n---\n\nWebM audio-video recording performed using the library RecordRTC by https://muazkhan.com/, MIT licence.",
