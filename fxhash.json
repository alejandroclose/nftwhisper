            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "Calligraphy is about formulating letters, not language. \n\nOne of my first exercises as a design student (c. 1967) was learning to letter. Using a nib holding pen and India ink we sat for 5 weeks in class like monks constructing letters in the style of a font called 15th Century Chancery Italic Script. Our final grade was based on how well we hand lettered a paragraph. It was a grueling process that's why I remember it; quite the way to develop an appreciation for the letterforms and type faces. \n\nThis algorithmic artwork is modern cuneiform. It is based on a theory I've developed called \"Language of Vision\" which in itself is an approach for creating a \"plastic\" image. The space-frame or background square consists of a subtle paper texture and defines the tablet. A resizable tile (spatial force) forms the boundary for a \"stroke.\" The stroke within the tile element is created by joining two bezier curves. \n\nAn algorithm called \"fractions of the whole\" is a \"form of spatial organization\" which divides the picture frame into randomly sized intervals along each axes that form the variable sized tile areas. The stroke is programmed to fit each area. This theory lends itself very nicely to algorithmic art and provides a general framework for generative art.\n\nThere is meaning in every image but that meaning comes from your experience and imagination.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "🔈 Click for Sound 🔈\n\nBit Operations is an visual exploration of computer fundamentals through bit-shifting operations. The visuals are generated by continuously shifting and combining binary patterns, resulting in evolving compositions of stark pixels and geometric shapes. The accompanying audio components are synthesized from this same modulating bit data.\n\nAt its core, the piece is driven by algorithms that perform bit-shifting - the simple acts of pushing binary values left or right within the computer's memory. By combining multiple shifting patterns together in different ways, complex permutations of light and dark visuals emerge. The audio reflects these same bit-level operations, with the rhythms and tones mapping directly to the shifts occurring in the data.\n\nThrough this formal process focused on bit-shifting, the piece lays bare the fundamental building blocks of how modern computers operate under the hood. It reduces computational logic to its most essential level - the manipulation of 1s and 0s through rudimentary shift operations. Yet from this simplicity, an infinite space of variations arises, both visually and aurally, highlighting the immense complexity potential within even the most basic digital operations.",

Just as the pixel resolution of an image affects its perceived quality, the resolution of an architectural space can affect its qualities and livability. By embracing digital variation through codes, this series explores the interplay between abstract and concrete space through multiple resolutions. \n\nRAUSCH is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by complex, chaotic and messy sensations, and aims to engage the viewer through a sense of wonder, disorientation, and awe.\n\nReleased on the occasion of Companions of Code, a group exhibition by VerticalCrypto Art at The NFT Gallery in London. \nCurated by Micol Ap.

            "description": "Whether by choice or circumstance, we often find our lives thrust into uncertainty. We're resilient, though — we find patterns in the chaos, deciphering and unraveling it piece by piece until a new comfort emerges. `gradient descent` is my expression of that cyclical flow that comes to dominate our lives.\n\nThe piece starts with comfort, a smooth gradient chosen from a curated palette. As the animation runs, that gradient is mutated by a unique sequence of linear transformations - slice, skew or stride on an underlying grid - as it descends into uncertainty. After a time the animation will reverse, peeling back each transformation and returning to comfort before beginning anew.\n\nThe menu - which can be accessed with a double click or Escape - gives you extensive control of the experience. I'd encourage you to explore these settings — they transform the feel of the piece, allowing you to adapt it to match your environment or mood. Any setting that can be changed in the menu can also be provided as a URL parameter - there's a button in the menu to export them all.\n\nBuilt with raw WebGL 1.0, optimised to run smoothly on most devices.\n\nBest viewed in full screen on large format displays.\n\n||| controls\n\n[hold space] ⇝ speed up\n[esc/2xclick] ⇝ toggle menu\n[g] ⇝ toggle gallery mode\n[p] ⇝ toggle pause\n[s] ⇝ capture current frame\n[a] ⇝ capture all keyframes\n[8/9/0/-] ⇝ change viewport\n\n||| settings\n\nAll settings are configurable via the interactive menu.

            "description": "[ TAP/CLICK TO ACTIVATE SOUND ]\n\nA whiff of pattern begins to emerge. Out of disarray comes the familiar pulsation of an ordered signal. The sense of regularity strengthens and we feel it swelling towards a singularity. Heeere weeee goooo… BAM! Then off again marching back into chaos to repeat the cycle.\n\nProposed by cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter in his 1979 book “Gödel, Escher, Bach”, and further developed in his 2007 book “I Am a Strange Loop”, “Strange Loops” are Hofstadter’s attempt at explaining the mechanisms that give rise to the sensation of “I” - through hierarchical, self-referential, and at times seemingly paradoxical feedback-loops of abstraction and causality. \n\n—\n\n“Who shoves whom around in the tangled megaganglion that is your brain, and who shoves whom around in ‘this teetering bulb of dread and dream’ that is mine?”\n\n“Do dreads and dreams, hopes and griefs, ideas and beliefs, interests and doubts, infatuations and envies, memories and ambitions, bouts of nostalgia and floods of empathy, flashes of guilt and sparks of genius, play any role in the world of physical objects? Do such pure abstractions have causal powers? Can they shove massive things around, or are they just impotent fictions?” \n\n\"In the end, we are self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages that are little miracles of self-reference. [...] Poised midway between the unvisualizable cosmic vastness of curved spacetime and the dubious, shadowy flickerings of charged quanta, we human beings, more like rainbows and mirages than like raindrops or boulders, are unpredictable self-writing poems — vague, metaphorical, ambiguous, and sometimes exceedingly beautiful.”\n\n- Douglas Hofstadter, “I Am a Strange Loop”, 2007\n\n–-\n\nMemo Akten \nƈօʍքʊtǟtɨօռǟʟ Aʀȶɨֆȶ; AI wrangler; curious philomath; PhD in Creative Artificial Intelligence with Meaningful Human Control; works with code to create images, sounds, films, large-scale responsive installations and performances; fascinated by trying to understand the nature of nature and the human condition.\n\nJames Paterson \nSynthesizing drawing, animation, sculpture and code under the moniker Presstube since 1999. Inspired by meditation, molecular biology, music, parenting, psychedelics, the seen, the heard, the felt, the cognized.\n\n–-\n\nControls:\n- CLICK/TAP ONCE ON THE SCREEN TO ACTIVATE SOUND\n- ‘S’: to toggle Sound on/off (only works when opened fullscreen)",

            "description": "`one hour` is an interactive installation exploring the bond between humans and computers, inviting you to pause and share a meditative moment with an algorithmic stranger.\n\nRather than conventionally interacting with the piece, lower your guard and allow it to interact with you through an intimately human connection - a heart beat. `one hour` follows this heart as it beats through an hour of its enduring existence, captured by an EKG divided into 60 rows of 60 seconds each. Stylistically, it emulates realistic paper and ink using custom texture and line renderers. The piece will play through the duration of the hour, pause for five minutes, then begin anew.\n\n`one hour` was created for a physical installation, projected to a wall and animated in real time. By default it will render at high speed to reveal the preview. For the most immersive experience at home, it should be viewed in full screen and adjusted to real time speed (controlled via the number keys).\n\n||| controls\n\n[s] save as png\n[r] reset animation\n[l] toggle looping [default on]\n[1-5] adjust render speed\n[--1] real time (1 hour) [recommended]\n[--2] 6x (10 minutes)\n[--3] 60x (1 minute)\n[--4] 300x (12 seconds) [default]\n[--5] full speed",
