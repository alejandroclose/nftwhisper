Be sure the check the menu that you can find by clicking/tapping the BUTTON in the TOP LEFT !!!\nIn this menu you'll find some options to customize and experience the artwork, as well as the exports menu.\n\n!!! TO EXPORT CLEAN HIGH RESOLUTION CAPTURES, click the \"EXPORTS\" button in the menu, select your desired resolution then click the \"START CAPTURE\" button. This only works when the generator is running in its own window, so be sure to click the \"OPEN\" button.\n\n2024 - Christophe Ulu Choffel\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0\nSee LICENSE.txt for full details",

            "description": "## regenerate : what is it about? ##\n\nI wanted the gradients to portray our inner energy status, like a power charge we keep regenerating. Made of many steps, they create the illusion of continuity. And, just like us, they sometimes disfunction.❤️\n\nThe title illustrates both the energy of these geometric outputs and my own return to a generative art practice. It's also a nod to the \"degen\" culture.\n\n## variations ##\n\nregenerate has 3 types of outputs:\n- the single column, in full color - these are the main outputs and define the visual identity of the drop - pure energy!\n- the single color column on grey - pure contrast!\n- the triplet - dysfunctional in the best sense!\nWell, there might be a 4th type, but that's a surprise...\n\nFor each mint, the number of steps will vary from 60 to 200+. The way the gradients blend into the larger background also depends on the mint: some blend completely, while other tend to the background color but never quite reach it.\n\n## Keyboards controls ##\n\n's' saves a high-res version of your output (4096x4096 px)\n‘m’ saves a low-res version (500 x 500 px), useful for social media\n'p' saves TWO smartphone formatted crops (1176 x 2556 px) so you can take your mint with you all day - one in full saturation, one at half saturation - you can use one for your lockscreen and one for your homescreen, for example, or you can make your own crops from the high-res image.\n\n## Technical note ##\n\nDepending on the size of your window, the number of steps may vary. That is intentional, and made to avoid any moire effects when scaling down. Instead, the overall impression of the output will remain visually the same at any scale.\n\n## Conclusion ## \n\nI hope you enjoy your mint, whether it's a single, triplet, or a powerful color on grey!\nThanks for reading and thanks for minting! 🙏\n\n-raphael, sept. 2023.",

            "description": "🔈 Click for Sound 🔈\n\nBit Operations is an visual exploration of computer fundamentals through bit-shifting operations. The visuals are generated by continuously shifting and combining binary patterns, resulting in evolving compositions of stark pixels and geometric shapes. The accompanying audio components are synthesized from this same modulating bit data.\n\nAt its core, the piece is driven by algorithms that perform bit-shifting - the simple acts of pushing binary values left or right within the computer's memory. By combining multiple shifting patterns together in different ways, complex permutations of light and dark visuals emerge. The audio reflects these same bit-level operations, with the rhythms and tones mapping directly to the shifts occurring in the data.\n\nThrough this formal process focused on bit-shifting, the piece lays bare the fundamental building blocks of how modern computers operate under the hood. It reduces computational logic to its most essential level - the manipulation of 1s and 0s through rudimentary shift operations. Yet from this simplicity, an infinite space of variations arises, both visually and aurally, highlighting the immense complexity potential within even the most basic digital operations.",

            "description": "\"Nature is the source of all true knowledge\".\n\nHave you ever taken the time to look, deeply look, at all the details in a humble patch of grass ?\n\nIn this tiny microcosm, a constant, fierce battle is going on, day after day, plants reaching out for sun, down for access to soil, fighting for survival. Smaller grasses form groups, alliances making it harder for taller ones to take over. Dead leaves remind us that some of them lost the fight, fallen warriors who, soon enough, will be forgotten too. Growth, decay, life, death, the endless cycle, right in front of our eyes.\n\nIt is fascinating, and, for me at least, an endless source of inspiration.\n\nIt is my hope that, through this project, you will take the time to take a closer look at nature, and that, as the pale blue dot we call home keeps getting drier and drier, remember that even humble patches of grass should not be taken for granted.\n\n\nKey commands:\n's' - save as png\n'b' - make the background transparent (for printing)\n'1', '2, '4' - set the pixel density, for resolutions up to 8000x8000\n\nThis updated version of the project should render on mobile devices, albeit with slightly reduced quality. \nIf you want to save the image for printing, I recommend you do so on desktop.\n",

We shrink our polygon by some fixed amount (inset), and then pick a point inside it. We then send off rays in N evenly spaced directions and use these to split the polygon into N new polygons. Repeat the process, varying parameters such as how we pick our point or the angles of our projected rays, and see what emerges.\n\nPress 'v' to download an svg output.",

            "description": "Each monogrid artwork gets initialized with a start up algorithm that builds up a set of rectangles and fills them with pixels. There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",
