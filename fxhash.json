            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "Richter is the second collaboration of Richard Nadler and Leander Herzog, following their first project called Gerhard. A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time.\n \nRichter works with data from 4 of 24 highres images, 30mb in total. This is the maximum size fxhash allows for a project and three times more than Gerhard. Richard Nadler created stunning new textures, enabling more variation in composition and detail to emerge at much higher resolution. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Richter elevates the approach from Gerhard with new methods for the realtime rendering process and new features like offline-first caching. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels as data.\n \nRichter is featured in the exhibition \"Generative Abstraction\" at Expanded.art in Berlin.\n \n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color.\n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen.\n- Press “s” to save the canvas.\n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nleanderherzog.ch/2023/richter/\nleanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/\nfxhash.xyz/generative/17030/",

            "description": "Adjacent is the third in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art. This piece focuses on the study of Diagonal White, a series he developed between 1970 and 1975.\n\nIn 1976, Ruth Leavitt published a collection of papers titled \"Artist & Computer\", which highlighted the 35 prominent generative artists and asked them to discuss their work. They were posed questions like, \"Do you feel art work created with a computer has now or will have an impact on art as a whole in the future?\". Edward Zajec was a subject of one of those papers and in it detailed the approach to Diagonal White. \n\nThe original program was run on a CDC 6200 computer at The Univeresiry of Trieste. The programming was done in collaboration with Dr. Matjaz Hmeljak, his long-time technical partner. Inspired by his collaborative relationship, Adjacent the output of a partnership between Christine Hall and Chris Maddern.\n\nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to save a high-resolution version of the image\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nBy @christine_hall and @chrismaddern",

            "description": "Within each of us resides an evolutionary history of primal emotions, yet we often spend our lives dulling and controlling these instincts rather than reveling in them. Art is one of the ways we best express those instincts and intuitions – accessing and visualizing their visceral qualities, and releasing our deepest emotions in a way we can share.\n\npang reflects emotions that take control of our impulses – anguish, euphoria, obsession. By using crayon-like marks, the artworks convey the catharsis felt while drawing with a childlike abandon. To capture what gives such marks true feeling, the works deliberate the intrinsic movements, pressures, and angles shaped by hands in various moods. These qualities and their frenetic meanderings represent the infinite possibilities of where the crayon could go next – if only we could free ourselves from the layers of control we've built.\n\nThe contradictions we struggle with are reflected throughout the works:  in the long, methodical, and mathematical path to creation that yields work that looks fast, free and unrehearsed;  through the randomly-informed computer generation of art that feels human;  and by the depiction of long-standing traditional techniques to help display the conceptual range of a young, innovative art movement still establishing its pivotal place in the canon of art. These tensions parallel the work's underlying concept, accentuating the suspicion that a learned fear of emotional expression might just be the source of our own pang. \n\nCreated in p5.js, pang is inspired by the emotional works and processes of later abstract expressionists such as Cy Twombly and Joan Mitchell – as well as contemporary artists like José Parla.\n\nFunctionality: \nPress ‘p’ to save as a png. \nPress ‘b’ to render with (or without) a transparent background.\nPress 0-9 to render at varying degrees of quality.  0 (lowest quality) to 9 (highest quality, 15000 pixels lengthwise).\nPress ⬆️ (arrow up) to incrementally increase pixel density.\nPress ⬇️ (arrow down) to incrementally decrease pixel density.\n\n__________\nTENDER x abstractment\nApril 2022\n",

            "description": "An archaeological artifact from the future, when many everyday objects are produced by generative algorithms. Some artifacts are in one piece, and others are fragmented. The color palettes are named after the rivers where artifacts in this design have first been discovered.\n\nURL and interactive features:\n\n- Append &r=<number> to the URL to change the image resolution. For example, &r=0.5 will halve the pixel count along both width and height, and &r=2 will double it.\n\n- Append &d=<number> to the URL to change the pixel density. For example, &d=0.3 will generate a very quick, coarse render, and &d=2 will generate very fine stippling.\n\n- Append &p to the URL to reveal detailed parameter settings used for the artwork.\n\n- Append &h to the URL to suppress the notification that rendering is in progress.\n\n- Press 's' in the live view to save the rendered image as a png.\n\nThe generative code is written in plain JavaScript. Polygon boundaries are determined via t-SNE, which is implemented in AssemblyScript and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for maximum performance. No external libraries have been used.

The unnatural drawing order and chromatic differences of the individual faces sometimes yields illusory or paradoxical visual geometries.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png.

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

The color palettes are named after the rivers where artifacts in this design have first been discovered.\n\nURL and interactive features:\n\n- Append &r=<number> to the URL to change the image resolution. For example, &r=0.5 will halve the pixel count along both width and height, and &r=2 will double it.\n\n- Append &d=<number> to the URL to change the pixel density. For example, &d=0.3 will generate a very quick, coarse render, and &d=2 will generate very fine stippling.\n\n- Append &p to the URL to reveal detailed parameter settings used for the artwork.\n\n- Append &h to the URL to suppress the notification that rendering is in progress.\n\n- Press 's' in the live view to save the rendered image as a png.\n\nThe generative code is written in plain JavaScript. Polygon boundaries are determined via t-SNE, which is implemented in AssemblyScript and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for maximum performance. No external libraries have been used.

The unnatural drawing order and chromatic differences of the individual faces sometimes yields illusory or paradoxical visual geometries.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png.

            "description": "“Thébaïde” is a french word for wild place, remote and peaceful, where to live in a calm retreat. It's also simply a desert and a synonym of solitude. It comes from Thebaid, an arid region of ancient Egypt and Thebes was the capital.\n\n“thébaïde” is my debut on fx(hash), almost one year since my first works minted on Objkt (a series of Indian ink drawings, in January 2022). After learning the basics of creative coding recently, and a few works with this technique, I decided to create a first generative project. With \"thébaïde\" I chose to express the minimalist and narrative aspects of my artistic approach (though the title and concept emerged at the end). Gradually the work was resonating with philosophical matters I'm obsessed with since years: time, emptiness, human condition, erosion, desire, chance, combining them into a visual metaphor. The view of a vast area, a changing silhouette, an impenetrable monolith or an opening to elsewhere or nothing, day and night and day and night and dawn and dusk — few elements able to compose a meditative and lasting tableau of questions and feelings.\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work.\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 px x 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.com",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",
