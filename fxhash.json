            "description": "Welcome to the ultimate pico_punk generator! This interactive token is a parameter based generator that creates unique pico_punk generators. Each one will generate one pico_punk with a number of layers chosen by you during the parameter selection phase. Additionally, you can use the buttons to navigate the generative space, and create your own pico_punks via an interactive process of discovery. This is the final pico_punk generator I intend to make, with the extra capabilities added by the parameter selection process, and the final tweaks and changes I made to the appearances and effects, I think this project is now as complete as I can ever make it.\n\nThe controls:\n- arrow keys: move through the generative space... each step adds one layer to the composition\n- x button: take a screenshot of the generated pico_punk\n- o button: clear all layers except the current one (clean slate for building a new pico_punk)\n\nEach layer has a chance to apply one of various visual effects, which vary in how transformative (or disruptive) they are.\n\n\npico_punks began as a project to create something akin to DOS Punks, but fully generative, without any manual intervention or pre-rendered components, using only the Pico-8 Fantasy Console. You can find the first generator here: (https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/439049). In this early version, the generator was interactive, but each pico_punk was totally isolated, being generated from one unique seed and one consistent process. Over time, this evolved to this final experience: one in which the \"curator\", the user exploring the generator, is not just choosing from an infinite number of punks, but actually the process of exploration itself is modifying the output before your eyes.\n\npico_punks is all about exploring themes of irreversibility, noise, pattern recognition, pareidolia, and of course identity. What began for me as something bordering on satire, has become an integral part of how I represent myself online. It is my sincere wish that with these tools you are also able to create something unique that you feel represents you, and is something that couldn't have been made without you.\n\nThank you so much for these last couple years of support, and here's to many more making and collecting art together :)\n\n\nNotes on minting: \n- 30% of royalties go to the minter\n- 10% of royalties go to previous curated pico_punk holders\n- One reserve spot is generated for each curated pico_punk held, and they stack\n- One extra reserve spot is for my Mom",

The objective is to share a personal perspective on how we bring home and nurture us while involving ourselves in a new environment.\nMy starting point towards the installation, is Legado, a generative art piece I created in 2022 where I explored the legacy of the women in my family and how I integrate it in my present life to take care of myself.\nIn “Arraigos, estudios 2” I go back to a classroom, my notebooks, and my pens. From that place I just drew lines, free lines, wondering lines. I keep drawing them. They bring me home.\nI always chose graph paper, even to write and there used to be four common pen colors in my school days: blue, black, red, and green.  That is the palette I have created for this mint.\nPress from “1” to “7” to render at higher resolutions. \nPress “s” to save a .png file at you given resolution.\n",

In a way it is a continuation of my previous works \"Contraformas\" and \"Similarity\".\n\nThe principle of emergence can occur through the combination of the following factors: number of paths, movement pattern of the walker, the separation of the paths from each other, the length and minimum of each path, the frequency with which these variables change, the position of the camera in the z axis, the decrease in the size of the boxes, whether or not the boxes have borders, the size of the borders, the color of the palette, the range of variation of the color, the distance of the lights for each box, and some other rules.\n\n3 available aspect ratios\n2400 pixels high\nMore than 40 color palettes\n3 canvas color styles\n2 styles of boxes\n\nPress \"S\" to save a png image\nPress \"T\" to save a tiff image (may take time, canvastotiff.js)\n\ncreated by @mdollinger using p5js",

This elemental rock has captivated the human imagination for centuries, serving as a symbol of raw strength, serenity, and beauty.\n\nI. The Dance of Fiery Passion - Fire:\n\nFire, a symbol of passion and destruction, has inflamed the artistic passion of countless creators. The allure of flickering flames, warm hues of red and orange, and the dance of light and shadow have inspired artists across time and cultures.\n\nFire, beyond its physical presence, is also a metaphorical representation of human emotions - from love and desire to anger and rage. Artists skillfully infuse their works with an emotional intensity and energy akin to fire, captivating viewers and awakening their deepest feelings.\n\nII. The Calm of Flowing Water - Water:\n\nWater, with its calming and transformative properties, is also a source of life\n\n\nIII. Frozen Elegance - Ice:\n\nIce as a metaphor for silence and contemplation. The interplay of light and shadow on the frozen surface has provided a unique artistic challenge, leading to the enchanting depiction of icy landscapes.\n\nIV. Grounded Forces - Earth:\n\nEarth, the firm and nurturing foundation of life, has become a symbol of strength and stability in art.\n\n=================================================================\n\nThe essence of these elements is to evoke emotion, tell stories, and explore human experience. Whether through passionate washes of fiery color, soothing streams of water, the ephemeral grace of ice, or the grounded power of the earth, this elemental rock continues to inspire and awe, weaving a symphony of art that resonates with the human soul.",

            "description": "　During the winter months, when I do not see any flowers in the city, it is as if I have forgotten that flowers exist. Sometimes, some time after the flowers have disappeared from the world, I suddenly spot a red bud on a branch poking out from the eaves of a house. It is a time when I have become accustomed to winter and have grown too accustomed to it. I am red! I think. Red! That is the ”ume\" blossom. Many people think of cherry blossoms when they think of spring flowers, but my favorite spring flower is the ume blossom. It is a wonderful flower that reminds me that there are flowers in the world and that spring is coming.\n　Ume blossoms are forgotten by the time the cherry blossoms bloom. I was born into this world on April 5, right on the border of when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom or not. I am born every year with the news that the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. But the plum blossoms are history. They are history and predecessors who built the world before I was born. When I am born again toward spring, I want to cherish the past. With this in mind, I created this work, wondering if I could paint the ume blossoms.\n　When I was making this, I felt like I was making sweets. It was a new sensation for me. The sensation of taking something that is commonplace in everyday life and cooking it in my own way was exactly like making sweets. I don't think sweets are noble. But I think they are something a little special. Above all, when sweets are placed in front of you, they bring forth a calm joy that cannot be contained from the bottom of one's heart. If there were many colors of such joy, if there were various kinds of sweets, I am sure we would be happy. This is a ume sweet. Please try it. I believe that these will become our cells and our past.\n\nume = 梅\n　This time, I put words to the color palette and shapes. It is not a universal language, but it is a special sound for me. If you want to know the meaning of the words, please ask me on twitter : @shirasu_nejio. However, I don't think that meaning is necessarily essential.",

It is important that you follow the following instructions.\n\nRecommendation: Don't rush to create your iteration, experiment with the algorithm and find new possibilities. It all depends on your skill and understanding.\n\nThis work was done using p5.js, the paper texture generator created by Steve's Makerspace, and the grain shader created by Dave Pagurek and Gorilla Sun.\n\nExplanation of the parameters:\n\n[Randomize colors]: Simply change the value to reassign the colors again.\n[ Color palette ]: Select the color palette.\n[Mixed palette]: If this box is checked [Color palette] will have no effect and the palettes will be mixed.\n[Shape]: Select the type of figure that will be drawn inside the polygons\n\nTo download the image in PNG format press [ s ]",

It is important that you follow the following instructions.\n\nRecommendation: Don't rush to create your iteration, experiment with the algorithm and find new possibilities. It all depends on your skill and understanding.\n\nThis work was done using p5.js, the paper texture generator created by Steve's Makerspace, and the grain shader created by Dave Pagurek and Gorilla Sun.\n\nExplanation of the parameters:\n\n[Randomize colors]: Simply change the value to reassign the colors again.\n[ Color palette ]: Select the color palette.\n[Mixed palette]: If this box is checked [Color palette] will have no effect and the palettes will be mixed.\n[Shape]: Select the type of figure that will be drawn inside the polygons\n\nTo download the image in PNG format press [ s ]",

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "Uninhabitable is a generative system built only from ellipses. The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state. Press \"h\" to save it.\n\nUninhabitable is an original work by Iskra Velitchkova. 2021.",

            "description": "At moment we decide to draw a square on top of a circle, we are defining a time arrow, a third dimension on the 2D plane, where shapes can be on o top of each other, come one after the other. In this project i wanted to remove that time arrow, that third dimension, and leave the 2D plane as flat as possible.\n\nShapes are not drawn in sequence, they are formed by the continuous addition of points to each region defined by the shapes intersections. Not a single region is on top of the other. They are the result of the combination of shapes, and defined by them. Horizontal, decentralized societies. Espacios comunes. We can see the circles, squares, plane cuts, but we cannot give them an order or authority.\n\n-----\n\nKey controls:\n\n- UP arrow: Increases the sketch resolution. It will take longer to render but it will produce better quality images.\n- DOWN arrow: Decreases the sketch resolution.\n- f: Removes or adds an empty frame around the image.\n- d: Increases the points density. More points will be painted and regions will become more full.\n- n: Increases the pixel noise.\n- b: Decreases the pixel noise.\n- z: Switches on and off the simple pixel sorting algorithm. Move the mouse left and right to change the pixel stickiness.\n- x: Switches on and off a more complex version of the pixel sorting algorithm.\n- i: Displays some log information.\n- p: Pauses the sketch.\n- s: Saves a screenshot of the artwork. The image resolution will depend on the sketch resolution, which is controlled by the UP and DOWN arrows.\n\n-----\n\nURL controls:\n\nwidth=2000 will set the sketch width to 2000 pixels.\nproportion=2.3 will set the sketch width-to-height ratio to 2.3.\nYou can combine these two parameters to create any image output you want. For example, to create an image that is 3000 pixels wide and 5000 pixels high, one just needs to add &width=3000&proportion=0.6 to the URL.\n\n-----\n\nSpecial thanks to @andregorayeb (Gora) and @ItonkStudio (Itonk) for letting me use some of their color palettes for this project.\n\n-----\n\nLicense: CC BY 4.0\n\nThis project makes use of the p5.js library.
