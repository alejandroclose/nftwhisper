            "description": "\"I never wanted color to be color. I never wanted texture to be texture, or images to become shapes. I wanted them all to fuse together into a living spirit.\" - Clyfford Still\n\n\nI have spent most of my life residing in urban environments. While figurative art is not a style I typically pursue in my own work, I delight in discovering abstract elements within it. The cities I've inhabited have consistently offered me the chance to do so through their architectural landscapes.\n\nLe Corbusier once said that a metropolis's abstract skyline serves as its autobiography, etched in steel and glass, unveiling its history, character, and ambitions. In this series, my aim has been to encapsulate that sentiment using a minimalistic canvas and a monochromatic palette. Abstract expressionism remains my lens for viewing every artwork. \n\nThe style of this series is my homage to Clyfford Still, an abex artist I have always admired. His ability to convey profound meaning through seemingly empty and unfilled canvases has always intrigued me. \n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress s to save the image in full screen. \n\nPixel Love!",

            "description": "This project uses cellular automata where the state of a cell in a new generation is determined based on its own and its neighbors' states in the previous generation. The guiding rules for these transitions, however, are not static; they undergo a random change every few generations, chosen from a possible 256 rules. By also slightly shifting the positions of cells and using an outline and texture that conveys a hand-drawn style, I have tried introducing an element of organic randomness.\n\nStepping away from the monochromatic color scheme used in my last three series, I have used a gradient effect to convey a transitioning hue across generations, combining a palette of two colors selected from an array of 14 different palettes. \n\nNote on the name: The alternating rules and fluctuating cell positions serve as the apparent justification for its name. However, a subtler inspiration lies in my deep admiration for Franz Kafka and his remarkable short story, \"The Metamorphosis\". Kafka’s narrative explores the constantly evolving state of human existence, where patterns appear momentarily only to dissipate quickly. Just when you think you've spotted a pattern, poof, it changes. Just like in life, right :)\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

            "description": "In 1934, German philosopher Max Bense published his first work “Raum und Ich” (Space & Ego) where he explored the concept of ‘information aesthetics’, proposing that the aesthetic value of an artwork could be derived from its underlying informational structure. \n\nBense asserted that \"Space\" extends beyond physical dimensions into the realm of abstract ideas, mathematical possibilities, and the unseen information shaping an artwork, while acknowledging its potential, boundaries, and prospects.\n\nThe term \"ego,\" usually associated with an artist's subjective impulses and emotional idiosyncrasies, is redefined in Bense's framework. As technology and information theory become integrated into artistic creation, the artist's role changes from a subjective creator to an architect of information and systems.\n\nThirty years later Manfred Mohr, an abstract expressionist, discovered Bense's information aesthetics in early 60’s, and his artistic thinking changed radically. Within a few years, his art transformed to computer generated algorithmic geometry. A pioneer of generative art, Mohr relentlessly explored precise geometric forms, symmetry, and a mathematical approach to art. \n\nWhile Bense’s work continues to provide a philosophical foundation and conceptual framework for generative art, Mohr demonstrated the power of computational processes to produce intellectually engaging artworks. The series 'Space & Ego' pays homage to both Bense and Mohr while initiating a dialogue. \n\nRooted in Mohr's concept of a random point within a square, this series broadens the \"space\" made possible by evolution of generative art. While the plotters of the 1960s were confined to monochromatic outputs, I have experimented with palettes uncommon in plotter projects. My choice of colors was expressive and more in tradition with abstract expressionists of 1960s. \n\nA random point is selected within a square, and the four resulting polygons are filled with lines. The probability of these polygons being filled with lines follows four approaches, ascending and descending from top-left to bottom-right (and vice versa), and radial expansion outward (and vice versa). All works can be plotted and have been designed for a precise fill of colors within the polygons. \n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a PNG of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete SVG file for plotting. \n\nAnd this is a redeemable project in case you’d like to receive a physical plot! \n\nPixel Love!",

One sunny morning, the village elders approached Samuel with a special request. They sought to erect a grand wall in the village square, a symbol of unity and prosperity.

One sunny morning, the village elders approached Samuel with a special request. They sought to erect a grand wall in the village square, a symbol of unity and prosperity.

            "description": "*WTBS.TXT* is the first collaboration between Thomas Noya and the Waiting To Be Signed podcast crew. Using the first year of episodes as training data, Thomas trained a GPT-2 model to generate text strings from seed words, phrases, or at random; over 3000 strings were curated from the model over several months. The strings are then randomly selected from the curated set and displayed in various fonts and patterns, evoking a retro-PC style inspired by 90s net.art.\n\nAn advantage of using so little data to train a model (yes, a year of content is nothing in AI terms) is that it allows the model to run wild and create funny and fantastical diversions. We used an AI service to transcribe the episodes, which introduced many spelling variations around fx(hash)-specific terms and artist names. All of this adds up to something that we are collectively excited to share with you.\n\nFrom WTBS: A year went by fast... so fast that we fully missed doing anything to celebrate. Please think of this token as a belated celebration of the first year of Waiting To Be Signed. This project could not be possible without the hours of content we produce each week. If you have enjoyed the show, we hope you will enjoy this as well. Please collect to support the continued creation of WTBS. Collect because you are a fan (of Thomas, us or both). Collect because it is a really cool project. Huge thanks to Thomas for volunteering his time to work with us on this, and thank you to everyone who listened and supported us as we move into our second year of the show.\n\n\nControls:\n[s] save as PNG\n\n\nWTBS ⫸ GPT-2 ⫸ p5.js ⫸ Blockchain\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2023 Thomas Noya and Waiting to be Signed\n\n◉_◉",
