No matter the age, situation, location, success of any individual, from time to time, each one of us undergoes bouts of uncertainty. Chaos is something that is often portrayed in a negative light, but every once in a while it can end up being something beautiful as well. For example a nice surprise in an otherwise hectic day! \n\nThis generative token is a celebration of chaos, a ray of hope amidst the tumultuous times that we live in, an escape from our internal vulnerabilities, a sense of closure and acceptance even when a lot might be going on in our lives. \n\nFeel free to mint as many as you want, gift it to your friends or loved ones, sell it, resell it or even make derivatives of your particular mint. I put in a reserve list for everybody who has collected any of my NFTs in the past so that my supporters don't miss out! This token is an expression of my gratitude to my supporters, and the entire FxHash community. Thank you all! \nKeep making art. No matter how hard today might be, be hopeful for a better tomorrow. \n\nMade with love in cables.gl",
