This way, each disegnatore has a different internal understanding of the city.\n\nIt then starts from the middle of the canvas and wanders out, stroke by stroke, probability by probability, trying not to intersect any previously drawn outlines and avoiding the edges of the canvas until a predetermined number of edges have been drawn.\n\nThe Markov chain drawing model is created during execution from a text file representation of a city map.\n\nOpen live to see your disegnatore drawing or to resize.",

            "description": "There’s beauty in simple things. Sunlight. A reflection on a puddle. The flight of a bird. Observing the clouds. Spending time with loved ones.\n\nTo celebrate the re-opening of fxhash, I'd like to contribute with some simple thing to enjoy among friends who rejoin after some time.\n\nSimple things is a piece that is just that: simple things. Nothing fancy here. Simple circles doing simple movement, with simple colours. Maybe the viewer will rejoice in observing them transit on the screen.\n\nIt has some controls: you can press “s” to save a png file. You can set a higher resolution pressing “d” followed by 1-9 to increase pixel density (if you get a black image, press “d 0” and start again with a lower number). Simple controls.\n\nIt has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n\nThe pieces exhibit simple variations: palettes, circle sizes, density of elements, backgrounds. The colours might be inverted sometimes. The direction of the movement changes also in some pieces. Some are grayscale pieces.\n\nJust like in life, enjoying simple things is sometimes enough to leave behind the noise and our worries. Also like in life, if one wants something extra, they may get it by looking for it...\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade in p5.js, and glsl for the image controls.",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

Randomly generated primitive geometry are rendered as texture that undergoes a series of nodes to create a grayscale image. The texture is then colored with gradient map, layered with pixel noise to divide it into a randomly sized grid then subtly blurred in some areas to create a dreamy effect.\n\nThe resulting visual can seem vaguely familiar but at the same time can not be pinpointed to a specific time and place identity; it can vary between a Futurist painting look-alike to resembling an early 2000s colorful news bumper. Hazy memory slowly and constantly shifting, clouded vision taste artificially sweet, sometimes with a metallic aftertaste.\n\nJust like saccharin.\n\n----------\nPress 'S' to capture a 3840x3840 screenshot of the current frame.\n⚠️ Can be GPU extensive! ⚠️\n\nXALTED 2022",

It whispers in our ear, reminding us of all the things we dare not face. It is a shadow that falls across our hearts, casting a pall of doubt and uncertainty. But even as it haunts us, we must remember that it is a part of us. We must learn to accept its presence, and to use it to our advantage. For fear is not always a curse, it is a guide that shows us where we must grow stronger. It is a companion that walks with us through the dark night, illuminating the path ahead. By embracing our fears, we find the courage to face them, and to overcome them. We find the strength to live fully, to love fiercely, and to pursue our dreams with abandon.\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nSpecter of Fears by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2023\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "A voxel is a unit of graphic information that defines a point in three-dimensional space. \n\nrubikVoxels is a return to the realm of 3D computer graphics. I define a 3D object, a cube, and construct a number of cube instances into an array that floats in 3D space. Each cube consists of 6 faces, each facet colored one of the 6 \"official\" colors of the Rubik's Cube (TM) palette. Hence, each cube (voxel) represents a solved Rubiks Cube (TM) puzzle.\n\nI use a combination of functions to control the rotation of each cube in its relative position in the array. As each cube is rotated you can see its various colored faces. I maintain the cubes' proper visibility by eliminating the facets of the cube that face away from the viewer, i.e., back face culling.\n\nTo quote my collaborator and friend Chris Scussel: \"I just LOVE the secondary patterns created by the gradual turning of the cubes!  The curves appear and disappear as one looks around the image. Interesting and fun!\" \n\n(c)2022 Dr.Bill Kolomyjec. All rights reserved.\n\nPlease visit www.drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Simple shapes, when strewn broadly and systematically, suggest the presence of infinite creative possibilities and are capable of portraying a visceral excitement felt by mixing the energy of light with the contemplation of dark.\n\nThis exercise has been repeated for ages, and its relevance will remain for as long as light may meet dark. The silhouettes of Stonehenge battling against a bright sky, the wabi-sabi placement of rocks in a Japanese garden hugged by methodical raking, the play of shadows in Plato's Allegory of the Cave, and the playfully arranged cut-outs of collage or chemical photogram — these all attest to the unending dynamism of form when imbued with light and the contrast of its absence.\n\nAs absence and darkness are made visible, the trail of their path conveys a speed as fast as light, and dark shapes that are no less important than the brightest figures. A symbiotic coexistence of these forces was born with the universe – and a delicate balance remains between the powerful glare of light and the stealthy speed of dark.\n\nInspired by photograms and a little-known series by documentary photographer William Klein, Speed of Dark references the visual language of the darkroom and the history of photography as an underlying analog for how an emerging art medium can harness simple elements to create evocative expressions.\n\nChoose a resolution by adding \"&width=9000\" to the URL in live view.\nRemove the border by adding \"&noborder=1\" to the URL.\n\n__________\nTENDER x Laurent Houdard\nMay 2022\n",

            "description": "Simple shapes, when strewn broadly and systematically, suggest the presence of infinite creative possibilities and are capable of portraying a visceral excitement felt by mixing the energy of light with the contemplation of dark.\n\nThis exercise has been repeated for ages, and its relevance will remain for as long as light may meet dark. The silhouettes of Stonehenge battling against a bright sky, the wabi-sabi placement of rocks in a Japanese garden hugged by methodical raking, the play of shadows in Plato's Allegory of the Cave, and the playfully arranged cut-outs of collage or chemical photogram — these all attest to the unending dynamism of form when imbued with light and the contrast of its absence.\n\nAs absence and darkness are made visible, the trail of their path conveys a speed as fast as light, and dark shapes that are no less important than the brightest figures. A symbiotic coexistence of these forces was born with the universe – and a delicate balance remains between the powerful glare of light and the stealthy speed of dark.\n\nInspired by photograms and a little-known series by documentary photographer William Klein, Speed of Dark references the visual language of the darkroom and the history of photography as an underlying analog for how an emerging art medium can harness simple elements to create evocative expressions.\n\nChoose a resolution by adding \"&width=9000\" to the URL in live view.\nRemove the border by adding \"&noborder=1\" to the URL.\n\n__________\nTENDER x Laurent Houdard\nMay 2022\n",
