The earth is changing, more and more, day after day, the satellite views are a great proof of that. Stay aware and be careful is important.\n\nI wanted to representing something real, linked with my values, and keep a beautiful composition and colors harmony.  I worked with a new fresh touch for the colors management.\n\nThe size, position and frequency of the pieces are generated for each token, along with the color theme. \n\nFeatures : \n- piecesCount : the number of circles and rectangles.\n- glitchLinesCount :  the number of lines behind the shapes.\n- MultipleGlitchDirections : if the directions of the lines behind are just horizontal or vertical, or both (10% of chance to have only one direction) .\n\n Handmade by code with Javascript, made with fragment.tools\n Quentin Hocdé, Brussels (Belgium), 2023.",

From there, I specifically developed it with non-plotter printing in mind, and more specific still, Riso Printing (think a scanner with a digital screen-printer MacGyver’d on).
