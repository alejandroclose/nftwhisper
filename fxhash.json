            "description": "Among the thousands of different types of natural ecosystems, we come across some that are more bizarre than others and have particular characteristics. They might also be imposing most of the time to us as a misty forest that contains plenty of diverse habitats. \n\nThe point with these beautiful is that they are too complex ecosystems because they're formed by numerous tree layers. Since these forests that consist of different types of trees develop in areas laden with water vapor or dew at the flora level, the degree of sun exposure is reduced, which makes the evaporation of water by plants much lower. \n\nAfter this information about the misty/foggy forests, I wanted to give the name called 'Rudeneja' which describes the way nature and/or the weather begins to feel like Autumn. I've tried to achieve that by creating a dense layer of trees, fog, grasses, and leaves. Also, the blur effect I've applied after all layers gives a nice depth effect in the composition. Each different color spot for the element of the piece translates the art's structure to a possible iteration. The features of the project are below, you can review and try them through the variations. \n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Back Trees Density: Very low-26%, Low-6%, Medium-7%, High-9%, Very High-52%\n- Big Tree: true-89%, false-11%\n- Leaves: true-29%, false-71%\n- Back Trees Type: Poplar-16%, Elm-9%, Sycamore-12%, Eucalyptus-11%, Dogwood-9%, Horse Chestnut-15%, Serviceberry-13%, Ginkgo Biloba-11%\n- Big Tree Type: Poplar-11%, Elm-10%, Sycamore-8%, Eucalyptus-9%, Dogwood-14%, Horse Chestnut-17%, Serviceberry-18%, Ginkgo Biloba-13%\n- Gray Scale: true-17%, false-83%\n- Fog Density: Very Low-17%, Low-14%, Medium-17%, High-23%, Very High-29%\n- Grass Colors: Absolute Dark-26%, Ebony Clay-13.5%, Rosy Brown-4.5%, Black Olive-9%, Black Eel-5.25%, Crater Brown-6.75%, Cork-6%, Bleached Cedar-3.75%, Night-7.5%, Gray-15.75%\n- Sky Colors: Gray-26%, Dark Blue-%9, Bordeaux-6.75%, Dark Sienna-5.25, Dark Blue Gray-6.75%, Tuna-6%, Asphalt-4.5%, Light Burgundy-5.25%, Clear Blur-4.5%, Black Bean-6.75, Bean Red-4.5%, Light Green-6.5%\n- Leaves Colors: Black-26%, Night-10.5%, Blur Charcoal-6.75%, Jaguar-7.5%, Wood Bark-6.75%, Sepia Black-10.5%, Dried Blood-14.25%, Dark Teal-8.25%\n- Fog Colors: Gray-27%, Lavender Pinocchio-11%, Link Water-10%, Pale Aqua-13%, Blossom-13%, Summer Green-13%, Jungle Mist-13%\n- Light Direction: Left-38%, Right-41%, Behind-21%\n\n\nPress 's' to export a 2000x3000 png file in live mode.\n\nThe project was tested on desktop Chrome 105.0.5195.127, Mozilla 104.0.2, and Edge 105.0.1343.42 versions.\n\nMade with p5js.\n\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0 LICENSE\n\nSeptember 2022 / Rhaegar",

            "description": "INSPIRATION\n\nSpirali was inspired by Tyler Hobbs' work with flow fields. However, instead of selecting random starting points for each shape to be drawn, which is more usual in flow fields works, I wanted to constrain the starting points to certain positions so that the shape being drawn could expand freely without the risk of colliding with other shapes, that's when I got to the spiral flow field.\n\nWHY SPIRALI?\n\nThe name of this collection is not only a direct translation of spirals in Italian, but it is also related to Italian cuisine and my own personal experience in Italy. The relationship with Italian cuisine is due to the immense number of types of pasta that exist, including one called spirali. When I was a child I only knew three or four types of pasta, but when I became a bit older I was amazed to learn that there were many more. Actually, there are hundreds. Just like from the same type of basic dough, you can make hundreds of types of pasta, my idea was, from just one type of spiral flow field, to make hundreds of images. A strategy of forcing creativity by imposing a major constraint.\n\nThe name of this collection also relates to my personal experience because it was visiting Italy many years ago that I first became interested in art and design because of the beautiful buildings, churches and works of art that I came across.\n\nDESIGN STRATEGY\n\nA spirali is made up of several tails and each tail is made up of a basic element, which I called slice. A tail may have from one to thousands slices. It is mainly the variation in the number of slices and how they are colored that creates the different tail styles in each spirali.\n\nThe slices start at the center of the spiral and in each iteration they grow a certain length or split in two depending on the parameters used in the algorithm, which also determine the outline and fill of each slice when it is rendered.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe main features that a spirali can have are:\n\n- Styles: Refers to the drawing patterns of each tail, that means, the shape, fill and stroke of the slices that form the tail. There are about 16 possible styles from which the algorithm will choose about 3 for each spirali.\n\n- Zoom out: It is related to how much larger the flow field area is in comparison to the image area. There are two possibilities: 50% and 100%.\n\n- Curvature: An arbitrary measure of the rate the tails of a spirali are turning. A spirali can have high or low curvature.\n\n- Rotation: The rotation direction: clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n- Tails: The number of tails in a spirali.\n\n- Palette: The palette's name. There are about 14 possible palettes.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n\n- Press \"m\" to export a medium resolution image (2000px x 2000px);\n- Press \"h\" to export a high resolution image (6000px x 6000px);\n\nLICENSING\n\nPlease see license.txt file.\n\nTwitter: @PauloSilvaGArt\nSite: https://paulosilva.art",

            "description": "INSPIRATION\n\nSpirali was inspired by Tyler Hobbs' work with flow fields. However, instead of selecting random starting points for each shape to be drawn, which is more usual in flow fields works, I wanted to constrain the starting points to certain positions so that the shape being drawn could expand freely without the risk of colliding with other shapes, that's when I got to the spiral flow field.\n\nWHY SPIRALI?\n\nThe name of this collection is not only a direct translation of spirals in Italian, but it is also related to Italian cuisine and my own personal experience in Italy. The relationship with Italian cuisine is due to the immense number of types of pasta that exist, including one called spirali. When I was a child I only knew three or four types of pasta, but when I became a bit older I was amazed to learn that there were many more. Actually, there are hundreds. Just like from the same type of basic dough, you can make hundreds of types of pasta, my idea was, from just one type of spiral flow field, to make hundreds of images. A strategy of forcing creativity by imposing a major constraint.\n\nThe name of this collection also relates to my personal experience because it was visiting Italy many years ago that I first became interested in art and design because of the beautiful buildings, churches and works of art that I came across.\n\nDESIGN STRATEGY\n\nA spirali is made up of several tails and each tail is made up of a basic element, which I called slice. A tail may have from one to thousands slices. It is mainly the variation in the number of slices and how they are colored that creates the different tail styles in each spirali.\n\nThe slices start at the center of the spiral and in each iteration they grow a certain length or split in two depending on the parameters used in the algorithm, which also determine the outline and fill of each slice when it is rendered.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe main features that a spirali can have are:\n\n- Styles: Refers to the drawing patterns of each tail, that means, the shape, fill and stroke of the slices that form the tail. There are about 16 possible styles from which the algorithm will choose about 3 for each spirali.\n\n- Zoom out: It is related to how much larger the flow field area is in comparison to the image area. There are two possibilities: 50% and 100%.\n\n- Curvature: An arbitrary measure of the rate the tails of a spirali are turning. A spirali can have high or low curvature.\n\n- Rotation: The rotation direction: clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n- Tails: The number of tails in a spirali.\n\n- Palette: The palette's name. There are about 14 possible palettes.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n\n- Press \"m\" to export a medium resolution image (2000px x 2000px);\n- Press \"h\" to export a high resolution image (6000px x 6000px);\n\nLICENSING\n\nPlease see license.txt file.\n\nTwitter: @PauloSilvaGArt\nSite: https://paulosilva.art",

            "description": "This project is part of a larger experiment that explores and celebrates the process of making generative art by progressively releasing iterations, working towards a final release on my main account (tz1RkYY3jr1ocuPdQqrRefr5FqoawKQsmBmD). The iterations will be titled ____ - Iteration 1, ____ - Iteration 2, etc. At this point, the number of iterations has not been determined, but more information will be provided as this experiment unfolds.\n\nThe final release will only be made available to those who have collected each iteration (using an allowlist), and will be released for free.\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

What does it mean to be stuck in one day? When everything around you is changing, living, breathing, dying, only you alone, like a stone statue. Nothing can touch you, and your feelings are externally muted to a minimum. Calm, joy, fear, anxiety, despair. You don't seem to have lost the ability to live, but you are somehow helpless and immobile. All your thoughts and experiences flow through your empty body, driving you insane. Everything around you distorts and changes in your eyes. And all you can do is remind yourself that it's just one long day. And I hope your tomorrow comes very soon. ",

            "description": "This project is about uncovering artifacts.\n\nEach piece is determined by approximately 15 parameters. This allows for a multitude of possible forms, and each iteration is an artifact to be discovered within the multidimensional space.\n\nThis work is focused around discovery. It is about exploring the space of the algorithm, shedding light on its many forms, and sometimes finding artifacts of the real world embedded within them.\n\nTechnically, this work is a composition of three primary elements: Voronoi tessellations, orthographic projection, and the depth-sort algorithm.\nThe latter of these is integral to the rendering mechanism. It works intuitively, drawing distant objects before near objects, evaluating the distance of each object according to its geometric center. It does this precisely, and in doing so, it can produce interesting visual artifacts, drawing some shapes in an unexpected order.\n\n\n\nThis has been a fascinating study, bringing light to unreal shapes and forms, and uncovering artifacts in an impossible space.\n\nI hope you enjoy it,\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Notes:\n- Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",
