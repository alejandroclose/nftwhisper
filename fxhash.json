When you look through the viewer of the kaleidoscope, these images multiply into complex and fascinating patterns.\n\nThe reflections in the kaleidoscope are created by the mirrors inside the cylinder. Typically, there are three or four mirrors, which are placed at specific angles to create the reflected patterns. When light enters the tube, it is reflected by the mirrors, creating a symmetrical image of the object or glass fragment placed at the end of the cylinder.\n\nThe result is a series of reflected images that repeat in geometric patterns, creating a mesmerizing visual effect.

It's a great way to explore the properties of light and color while creating visually appealing and mesmerizing images.\n\nIn this project, I drew inspiration from the mesmerizing reflections and variations that a kaleidoscope can create, as well as its simple yet elegant design. Using p5.js, I explored the potential for generating variations of Hydra, and experimented with integrating hex colors into the Hydra workflow.\n\nBy building on the concepts of the kaleidoscope, I aimed to create a unique and visually appealing project that showcases the beauty and complexity of reflective patterns.
