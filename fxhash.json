These tiles are a frumpy reminder of folk wisdom passed down through the generations. \nMost grandparents have at least 3x of them. \n\nToday we love to give these as an ironic joke present to friends at a housewarming party. We then hang these at a prominent place, like our toilet, so family and guests can be inspired by the wisdom of oldentimes while doing the business.\n\nIt's literally wisdom for you to poop on. \n\nFor this I've taken this tradition and given it a modern twist. I collected all the elements: walls, tiles, Delfts Blue patterns*, countless dutch proverbs, cut them up, sprinkled with icons, made some tweaks for added humor, put it all in a blender, and turned that dial to 11. \n\n*For the Delfts Blue designs, I took inspiration not just from Dutch culture, but also from Keltic, Polynesian, and Heavy Metal / Punk. It adds much needed diversity and it fits perfectly.\n\nThe end result is the NFT collection you see here.\n\nI hear you asking: Hey @Platolstoy: These new mixed-up proverbs, what do they mean? \nAnswer: Well, that's up to you, really. What do you want it to mean? \n\nMost of the elements in the layers were sourced from Midjourney, designed in Photoshop, composited in After Effects, and last but not least generated with @PureSpider's PFP Token generator.\n\nThis project is a layered composition consisting of:\n65x Backgrounds of different walls\n27x Tiles of different materials\n36x Delfts Blauw* patterns\n86x Cheesy proverbs 2x lines\n66x Icons\n\nIn total: literally a million-gazillion unique combinations of Wisdom Tiles.

            "description": "In the Netherlands we have a tradition that just won't go away. It's the Delft's Blue porcelain wisdom tiles. These tiles are a frumpy reminder of folk wisdom passed down through the generations. \nMost grandparents have at least 3x of them. \n\nToday we love to give these as an ironic joke present to friends at a housewarming party. We then hang these at a prominent place, like our toilet, so family and guests can be inspired by the wisdom of oldentimes while doing the business.\n\nIt's literally wisdom for you to poop on. \n\nFor this I've taken this tradition and given it a modern twist. I collected all the elements: walls, tiles, Delfts Blue patterns*, countless dutch proverbs, cut them up, sprinkled with icons, made some tweaks for added humor, put it all in a blender, and turned that dial to 11. \n\n*For the Delfts Blue designs, I took inspiration not just from Dutch culture, but also from Keltic, Polynesian, and Heavy Metal / Punk. It adds much needed diversity and it fits perfectly.\n\nThe end result is the NFT collection you see here.\n\nI hear you asking: Hey @Platolstoy: These new mixed-up proverbs, what do they mean? \nAnswer: Well, that's up to you, really. What do you want it to mean? \n\nMost of the elements in the layers were sourced from Midjourney, designed in Photoshop, composited in After Effects, and last but not least generated with @PureSpider's PFP Token generator.\n\nThis project is a layered composition consisting of:\n65x Backgrounds of different walls\n27x Tiles of different materials\n36x Delfts Blauw* patterns\n86x Cheesy proverbs 2x lines\n66x Icons\n\nIn total: literally a million-gazillion unique combinations of Wisdom Tiles. (1000 ed)\nFeel free to explore and choose one that fits your look on life.\n\nHave a nice day! \nPlastic Tolstoy / @platolstoy / https://plastictolstoy.com/",

These tiles are a frumpy reminder of folk wisdom passed down through the generations. \nMost grandparents have at least 3x of them. \n\nToday we love to give these as an ironic joke present to friends at a housewarming party. We then hang these at a prominent place, like our toilet, so family and guests can be inspired by the wisdom of oldentimes while doing the business.\n\nIt's literally wisdom for you to poop on. \n\nFor this I've taken this tradition and given it a modern twist. I collected all the elements: walls, tiles, Delfts Blue patterns*, countless dutch proverbs, cut them up, sprinkled with icons, made some tweaks for added humor, put it all in a blender, and turned that dial to 11. \n\n*For the Delfts Blue designs, I took inspiration not just from Dutch culture, but also from Keltic, Polynesian, and Heavy Metal / Punk. It adds much needed diversity and it fits perfectly.\n\nThe end result is the NFT collection you see here.\n\nI hear you asking: Hey @Platolstoy: These new mixed-up proverbs, what do they mean? \nAnswer: Well, that's up to you, really. What do you want it to mean? \n\nMost of the elements in the layers were sourced from Midjourney, designed in Photoshop, composited in After Effects, and last but not least generated with @PureSpider's PFP Token generator.\n\nThis project is a layered composition consisting of:\n65x Backgrounds of different walls\n27x Tiles of different materials\n36x Delfts Blauw* patterns\n86x Cheesy proverbs 2x lines\n66x Icons\n\nIn total: literally a million-gazillion unique combinations of Wisdom Tiles. (1000 ed)\nFeel free to explore and choose one that fits your look on life.\n\nHave a nice day! \nPlastic Tolstoy / @platolstoy / https://plastictolstoy.com/",

            "description": "The outputs created by this algorithm reminded me of the colourful bead mazes that children play with. So, I named the algorithm 'Kralen', which means 'beads' in Dutch.\n\nThe algorithm 'Kralen' creates random bezier curves using the edges of a rectangular boundary, and places beads atop these curves to create a 'bead maze' effect. The algorithm offers different curve creation modes, with the most common mode being 'Mix'. In this mode, two random edges of the boundary are chosen to form bezier curves. Other modes create curves that are horizontally or vertically oriented, or formed using only the corners of the boundary\n\n---\n\nThe work is created with p5.js with the help of bezier.js for working with bezier curves.",

            "description": "Henge is an exploration of circular megalithic structures of the prehistoric age. It is a work of historical fiction where these stone assemblies, achieved through herculean efforts of stacking, aligning, and balancing immense chiseled rocks, are reimagined within an alternate universe of algorithmic possibility. Historically, henges share a few qualities that inspired this project. First, they are places of gathering within a loose collection of stones to organize ceremony or worship under celestial alignments. They are also monolithic in their materiality and employ the most elemental techniques of megalithic, or large stone, construction. These particular types of henges, known as cromlechs, are circular spaces fit with purpose and ritual and in this sense, serve as precedents to the great human edifices; charging landscapes with meaning and presence through geometry and order. Finally, henges are a collective language of place-making shared across a range of cultures and ages, from the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras and across territories from modern-day Morocco, Portugal, Brazil, Germany, Scandinavia, to the well-known Stonehenge in Great Britain.\n\nThis project is deeply inspired by the timeless and universal narrative created through the thoughtful and deliberate placement of large rocks in a circle. It seems that when confronted with marking a place and communing with nature, human beings like to make circles out of stones. Among all the symbols of place making, the circle is the original and still remains the most universal. Through the use of code to portray these imperfect structures, Henge animates the history of these circles in all their roughness and seemingly endless variation.\n\n\n--------\n\nCreated by Aranda\\Lasch @ArandaLasch\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\nNovember 2022\n\n[Interaction instructions]\n'left' + 'right' arrow keys to change view\n'i' saves a 2048x2048 PNG\n\n[Info]\np5.js\nHenge is optimized for Chrome, runs slowly on Firefox (the longer the wait, the more stones and/or grass are being generated)\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n10% of all primary and secondary proceeds donated directly to Girls Who Code\n",

Genuary 2023 took place during the month of January 2023. Afterwards, as it happens, comes Genuary 32nd. This is an imaginary week, during which we develop one of our Genuary pieces into a 32 edition \"not very long\"-form generative project on fx(hash).\n\nMy Genuary 32nd project is based on Genuary 22nd: Shadows, the design of which again was based on the \"art deco\" pattern from day 20.\n\nThe patterns form a grid-like fence structure, dividing the space and creating an infinite cage. Light coming from the outside casts stark shadows on the floor. Several variations on halftoning techniques are used to portray tone, occasionally destroying depth perception into an abstract interplay of form.\n\nThe code of this piece has been diminished into a mere 3397 characters.\n\nYou can use the URL-parameter &m=2 as a resolution multiplier, to render images larger than your screen.\n\n(c) 2023 by Piter Pasma. https://piterpasma.nl",

            "description": "In Flow is the first in a series of four projects exploring flow fields, produced with 100% code in p5.js.  This one has a consistent gap between flow lines and a low noise resolution, producing a wispy effect that often looks like thread or felt.  Sometimes the background is a bit garish, which can be fun.  There's a good chance some texture will be added in the end, either mixing the colors and softening, or adding a fine paper texture.  It finishes off with a grain shader by Dave Pegurek found here: https://editor.p5js.org/davepagurek/sketches/m6p09ERHx\n\nAfter opening, hit 2 - 5 for higher pixel densities, and 's' to save a png. Resizing the canvas reverts to pixel density 1.\n\nCome visit my YouTube channel for generative art how-to videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjYUJudUW67Tg79jtF_rpQ",

            "description": "In 1970, mathematician John Conway devised his eponymous \"Game of Life\", also known simply as \"Life\", a cellular automaton that plays out on a 2D grid of orthogonal cells. The game requires a starting configuration of \"living\" cells (all other cells are assumed to be \"dead\"), and at each discrete step forward in time, the following transformations occur:\n\n- Every living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n- Every living cell with more than three living neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n- Every living cell with exactly two or three living neighbors survives.\n- Every dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes to life, as if by reproduction.\n- Every dead cell without exactly three living neighbors remains dead.\n\nConway's Game of Life feels very simple at its outset. And yet, computer scientists have discovered a staggering degree of complexity, and a vast lexicon of dynamic forms, all within the bounds of its highly constrained 2D universe. It is Turing complete, meaning that given a large enough grid and an appropriate starting configuration, it's possible to create a functional computer inside Game of Life. Given unlimited processing power and memory, one could run Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life... ad infinitum.\n\nBut what would it look like for a small percentage of living cells on the grid, in the course of their \"lives\", to write some poetry?\n\nWhat if each living cell also could increment somehow at each time step it stayed alive, imbuing cells with a visible age?\n\n\"Life in The Waste Land\" is Conway's Game of Life applied to poetry -- more specifically, a poem: The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot.\n\nIn this implementation of Game of Life, the grid is monospaced text, and each living cell has a very small chance of generating a few lines, all entirely inspired by The Waste Land. Each token will track its unique starting configuration's progress forever. The grid is infinite, and the dynamic patterns extend far beyond the fixed boundaries of your screen. Some tokens will remain dynamic for a very long time, while others will settle down quickly, at which point continuously living cells may iterate through nearly every Unicode character.\n\nThank you for collecting. Please enjoy.",

            "description": "The outputs created by this algorithm reminded me of the colourful bead mazes that children play with. So, I named the algorithm 'Kralen', which means 'beads' in Dutch.\n\nThe algorithm 'Kralen' creates random bezier curves using the edges of a rectangular boundary, and places beads atop these curves to create a 'bead maze' effect. The algorithm offers different curve creation modes, with the most common mode being 'Mix'. In this mode, two random edges of the boundary are chosen to form bezier curves. Other modes create curves that are horizontally or vertically oriented, or formed using only the corners of the boundary\n\n---\n\nThe work is created with p5.js with the help of bezier.js for working with bezier curves.",
