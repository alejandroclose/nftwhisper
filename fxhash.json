            "description": "Watch your computer perform \"digital marbling\" by dropping digital colored inks on digital liquid and shape it with its own little digital fingers and some not very honest laws of digital physics.\n\nViscous Circles is the first iteration on a brand new Wasm/Rust fluid simulation engine. I intend to produce other generators with the many other ideas for digital marbling. If you like it, don't hesitate to mint some tokens, it helps me finance my work as it requires lots of energy & time to mix both technical exploit and artistic creation.\n\n\nControls\n\nYou can stop at any step if you like the state at this instant, you can restart it, de/increase resolution (default is 4096x4096 to have sharp image, up to what your CPU/GPU can manage) and snapshot at any resolution.\n\n- H: hide/show help.\n- Space - pause/start animation.\n- R - restart animation.\n- I - hide/show res/fps panel.\n- A-Q/D - down/up full resolution\n- S - take full resolution snapshot\n\n\nThe story\n\nI'm fascinated by the ancient art of \"marbling\", specially Turkish marbling (Ebrû), Japanese marbling (Suminagashi) but also Italian marbling from Florence and others from Persia, India, etc... Marbling's idea is so simple: drop ink droplets of different colors, viscosity, quantity in a liquid and let fluids interact following laws of nature. If they can't mix, they will repel each other create evocative shapes with respect to the strength when you drop it. Sometimes, they'll mix a bit creating new colors. Then you can shape by moving, pushing color particles with pencils, creating wind on the surface etc... Possibilities are infinite. At the end, you \"print\" the creation on a paper you put on the surface of liquid that will \"drink\" the ink. For examples, check Ertugrul Incel, a Turkish artist making amazing creations with fantastic color & compositions that can be minted on NFT platforms https://twitter.com/ErtugrulIncel.\n\nYet, what fascinates me in marbling is not only the result but the process of creation: I love watching marbling artists shaping their creations, it's like magic. You'll find plenty samples on youtube.\n\nThus, I wanted to build a unique generator inspired by those techniques and artists yet very humbly, not pretending to reproduce real-life marbling or artists. I want it to be \"digital marbling\" with its own behaviors, visuals, limitations. And the most important: I want it to offer the marbling performance made live to my minters. Finally, we are in computer world so we can simulate physics but we are also not constrained by it so we can change physics. Thus, you'll see behaviors that are impossible in real-life (specially about curls & vortices).\n\nThis generator is also the result of a long technical exploration. I've spent couple of months building a Webgl/WASM/Rust/JS engine approximating Navier-Stoke fluid mechanics equation on GPU (and CPU too), strongly relying on existing great implementations https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation and https://shahriyarshahrabi.medium.com/gentle-introduction-to-fluid-simulation-for-programmers-and-technical-artists-7c0045c40bac themselves reproducing other works, specially those from Nvidia people. The rest of the work is my own touch to make it behave as I want first and then make the generative magic happen by randomizing creation until it starts to surprise myself. And I'm really surprised.\n\nNow, time to marble!\n\nViscous Circles @naibdian 2023 Project made using Opensource WebGL, WASM/Rust/JS libs\n",

This piece marks its anniversary, and is intended as a THANK YOU to all the people that collected my works. \n\nIt is based on the same algorithm as \"Finding my way\", i.e. a line growth animated process based on Substrate (Jared Tarbell, 2003) guided by dynamically changing vector fields made with trigonometric functions, but it uses different palettes, more vector fields, and a few more tweakings of the algorithm parameters.\n\nThe original piece was intended to symbolise a person's process of finding her/his way. Upon further reflections on the result, I think it more as representing a community process. So here is my wish for the Fx(hash) community, let's keep on finding our way.   \n\nIn what now could become a tradition, I've stolen again a palette from the beautiful work of Iskra Velitchkova.\n\nImplemented using various packages from thi.ng/umbrella by Karsten Schmidt, AKA Toxi",

            "description": "\"◉◉◉\" presents a collection of pointillistic drawings generated by p5js. However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.\n\"◉◉◉\" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.\n\nThe technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

            "description": ">>> GAN ⫷glitch⫸ Ting Xu |  幹亭序 <<<\n\n• Generative glitch collage: More than simply a + b + c •\n\n\nAt the apex of Chinese calligraphy, Lantingji Xu, the preface, was written by the most renowned calligrapher in China, Wang Xizhi (王羲之).\n\nDuring the Spring Purification Ceremony, forty-two literati gathered along the banks of a coursing stream and engaged in a \"winding stream\" drinking contest: cups of wine were floated on the water upstream, and whenever a cup stopped in front of a guest, they had to compose a poem or otherwise drink the wine. At the end of the day, twenty-six literati composed thirty-seven poems in total and the Lantingji Xu, as a preface to the collection, was produced by Wang on the spot.\n\nIn the GTX collection, we create new intricate and expressive relationships between ink, paper, and pixels using Jimi's raw calligraphy work, their GAN offsprings, and Thomas's CHX-like glitch processing, generating unique calligraphy on mint and toasting at the same time.\n\n\nHow it works:\n\nCombining sets of raw layers that range from paintings, calligraphy, and GAN seeds, our algorithm applies an array of image processing magic, creating intricate novel outputs.\n\nWe have 102 raw layers separated into four groups. Each final output is formed by mixing and processing four randomly selected layers. \n\nGroup 1 contains textures, and it is composed of Jimi's paintings, GAN seeds from mixed custom models, and CLIP Guided Diffusions. \n\nGroup 2 contains Jimi's calligraphy work. \n\nGroup 3 contains GAN calligraphy seeds from custom models we trained on Jimi's body of work. \n\nGroup 4 contains digital grain textures.\nOur algorithm starts by selecting one layer from each group, assigning them sizes, opacities, orientations, and other parameters. Then it sets a dithering combination to be applied. We have eight combos formed by combining seven different custom dithering algorithms (3 at a time). \n\nAfter each dither gets applied to its corresponding layer, images get mixed using different blend modes to help combine them in fun ways. Afterwards, a couple more filters get applied to glue everything together. When all is said and done, final artworks get rendered onto the canvas.\n\nSit back, open the live view, and enjoy. \n\n\nAppreciate the art, not the speculation. Pay what you can. \n\nWith love, sweat, and tears –drops– \nJimi and Thomas.\n\n\nJimi's notes:\n\nI provided the calligraphy representing the extreme spectrum of my expression in brushwork and poetry. I also evaluated the GAN calligraphy outputs, helping Thomas hone the models. During the training process I was horrified and in awe by both the stupidity and sometimes brilliance of the GANs.\n\nThrough the layering techniques developed by Thomas, I have also gained new insights into calligraphy, taking it beyond brush, ink and paper. The spectrum of expression in calligraphy gets freed from traditional constraints in GTX. Fx(hash) calligraphy has become brush, code and screen. \n\nThomas does not read Chinese, but I was happy to let him crop my scrolls into square layers in ways he saw fit with the project's aesthetic. To my surprise, I did not only agree with his visual choices but also noticed how the illiterate crops had many Freudian slips. That is, my poetry made sense fractally. I think this is no coincidence for calligraphers that write their poetry. Calligraphy is more than the sum of beautiful brushstrokes and also greater than the sum of pretty characters. Calligraphy is the composition of space and semantics. Only in turn does meaning takes its place in parts of calligraphy. \n\n\nControls:\n[s] save as PNG.\n\n\nPaint / Ink / Photography –> GANs / Diffusions –> p5.js –> Blockchain\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2022 Thomas Noya and Jimi Wen\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n◉_◉ ◉_◉",

            "description": "\"◉◉◉\" presents a collection of pointillistic drawings generated by p5js. However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.\n\"◉◉◉\" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.\n\nThe technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

            "description": "\"Versus in Motion\" is an animated version, a successor of original \"Versus\" collection\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/21865\n\nIncludes all features of \"Versus\" (resolution levels, switchable orientation, etc) plus it's animated (obviously) and interactive\n- You can stop & start animation at any time by pressing the spacebar\n- You may click (or click & drag) while in animation or not, to modify the current artwork\n\nAnimation cycle is actually a transition between a \"full\" and an \"empty\" state that symbolizes the transition between existence, non-existence,  prosperity & decline and the evolution and progress in general as a result of time passage..\n\nAll are pure code, shapes and curves that processed in a custom fragment glsl (webgl) shader using a relative \"advanced\" developed mixing technique.\n\nCONTROLS\n\nKEYS:\n\n- 1-4: Set resolution from 1x to 4x of the current dimension (possibly slower performance in higher values)\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait with aspect ratio 0.75 (useful eg. for printing)\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape with ratio 4/3  (1.333..)\n- O: Original orientation. That is the default Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ when switching \n  orientations\n\n  For animation:\n- Spacebar: toggle animation (on/off)\n- R: Reset the center of animation (if has been modified with click or drag)\n\nMOUSE:\n\n- Click (or Click & Drag) to set the center of animation\n\n----\nMade with p5js and custom shaders\n\n© Dec. 2022  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

            "description": "This project began as an exploration of how human beings across all sorts of cultures respond in remarkably similar ways in terms of associating sounds with shapes.  That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",
