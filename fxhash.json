With a few changes in the order, arrangement and color, you can create unique random designs in them. I always had ideas of space photos, planets and molecular changes in my mind, but I never came up with a specific idea. As long as the circles attract my attention, yes, these are the circles that can turn my mental challenges into reality. This design may not be scientifically correct, but it is not physics, mathematics or anything like that. These are my mental patterns that want to turn the contents of my imagination into artistic creations. I am not a seafarer or an astronaut, so I always stay away from complex scientific concepts because they make me move away from the wonderful space I have in my mind about the universe and my imaginations lose their beauty. I will design my world so it looks more beautiful.\n\nControllers (Save as PNG)\n[s] - [2000*2000]\n[S] - [4000*4000]\n\nMade by p5.js",

Particle accelerator experimental devices produce a set of geometric shapes and lines, which I have used in this work. Various exotic particles are created through acceleration, filtering, and collisions. It is often my intention to question relationships between objects and contexts, reality and imagination, and realism and abstraction using imaging and machine learning methods.

These flows are the result of heavy rainfall, which exceeds the permeability of the soil. Surface runoff increases in depth as it approaches the drainage boundary. First, they are non-erosive, multilayered flows, and then they become raging waves.\nThis collection is inspired by Badlands. A single palette with two main colors was used, and the LerpColor function was used to produce the colors between them.\n\nMade by p5.js",

            "description": "Curved Symphony is a mesmerizing collection that delves into the beauty of continuous, flowing lines, meticulously crafted to create captivating visual experiences. Each artwork in this series is a testament to the elegance of algorithmic design, where curves are drawn and then echoed with slight variations in color and spacing. This method produces a rich tapestry of intersecting and parallel lines, forming intricate patterns that invite the viewer to explore the complexity within simplicity.\nThe interplay of these lines results in a dynamic dance of density and openness, where some areas burst with vibrant, overlapping curves while others breathe with serene, empty spaces. The varying angles and repeated motifs create a sense of movement and rhythm, evoking the sensation of a symphony playing out on the canvas.\nBy blending technology with artistic intuition, Curved Symphony transcends traditional boundaries, offering a unique fusion of precision and creativity. This collection invites you to lose yourself in the harmonious flow of curves, discovering new perspectives and emotions with each viewing. It’s a celebration of form, color, and the limitless possibilities that emerge when art and algorithms intertwine.\n\nS = Save\nMade by p5.js",

With a global tempo typically set in days, we fit all sorts of temporal structures where our joys and fears live and play out over the span of our lives. This series is a metaphorical transposition of the musical counterpoint into a visual space, sometimes with repeating patterns, sometimes with broken structures, sometimes isolated notes / hours / souls.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.
