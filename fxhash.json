            "description": "‘For the artist communication with nature remains the most essential condition. The artist is human, himself nature; part of nature within natural space.’ (Paul Klee, 1944) \n\n\nWorking on long-form nature has an interesting side effect. On the one hand, you're attempting a shallow imitation of a landscape.... You are working with cold logic and code, vainly trying to control randomness to create this virtual facsimile, something you know is artificial.... \n\n....and yet.... even with all this left-brain activity, your right-brain pushes back, and imagines being there. While working on this project I found myself continually daydreaming, wandering off to hear the sounds of waterfalls, or the crunch of walking along a sandy lake shore. If you've ever wondered about coding, I urge you to learn. Daydreams await....\n\n\nPress '1' once rendering is finished, to redraw at 5120x5120 resolution \nPress '2' to export without post-processing effects \n\n3rd party libraries (license text and links included in source) \n- p5.js - Creative coding framework \n- JS Topology Suite \"JSTS\", a port of Java Topology Suite \"JTS\" - High-level Geometry library \n- WebGLImageFilter, Dominic Szablewski - phoboslab.org \n\nI have tried to use soft blurs and shadows to give a sense of layering and depth to the scene. After viewing for a while, it reminds me of 3D paper-art. There are traits for colour and amount of birds, waterfalls, etc. but none are especially rare – These properties are intended for filtering the collection.  ",

The artist is human, himself nature; part of nature within natural space.’ (Paul Klee, 1944) \n\n\nWorking on long-form nature has an interesting side effect. On the one hand, you're attempting a shallow imitation of a landscape.... You are working with cold logic and code, vainly trying to control randomness to create this virtual facsimile, something you know is artificial.... \n\n....and yet.... even with all this left-brain activity, your right-brain pushes back, and imagines being there. While working on this project I found myself continually daydreaming, wandering off to hear the sounds of waterfalls, or the crunch of walking along a sandy lake shore. If you've ever wondered about coding, I urge you to learn. Daydreams await....\n\n\nPress '1' once rendering is finished, to redraw at 5120x5120 resolution \nPress '2' to export without post-processing effects \n\n3rd party libraries (license text and links included in source) \n- p5.js - Creative coding framework \n- JS Topology Suite \"JSTS\", a port of Java Topology Suite \"JTS\" - High-level Geometry library \n- WebGLImageFilter, Dominic Szablewski - phoboslab.org \n\nI have tried to use soft blurs and shadows to give a sense of layering and depth to the scene. After viewing for a while, it reminds me of 3D paper-art. There are traits for colour and amount of birds, waterfalls, etc. but none are especially rare – These properties are intended for filtering the collection.  ",

            "description": "A mix of aesthetics from the Ukiyo-e and Shin-hanga woodblock movements, with modern elements.  \n\nukiyo-e (浮世絵) = \"pictures of the floating world\", which peaked in the late 19th century. \nshin-hanga (新版画) = \"new prints\", from roughly the 1920-1950s. \n\nSome comparisons between the prints of the Japanese masters and gen-art: \n\n* The number of prints. Based on how well a piece was received, the publisher could decide to produce more copies, usually in batches of 200. Compare this to limiting the edition size on fx(hash). The initial prints would have sharp lines and accurately coloured areas. Very popular prints with thousands of impressions would slowly degrade the blocks, leaving final prints with worn-out linework and colours that weren't true to originals.  \n\n* Woodblock prints were actually a collab between the artist, the wood carver, and the printer. In many cases only the artist and publisher were recognized on the final prints. It was usually the publisher who owned the woodblock, not the artist. Often the artist was considered a worker, contracted at the request of the publisher or patrons funding the project. Compare this to the NFT space, where ownership is carved onto the blockchain, and artists have freedom to create whatever they wish. \n\n* Copyminters.... Similar to the NFT world, fake publishers sprang up from time to time, who would reproduce famous prints. Enji Takamizawa was one such counterfeiter, who was able to skilfully produce woodblocks replicating originals down to the wood grain! \n\n* While fine-quality woodblock prints from the Edo era command huge auction prices today, they were in reality affordable art for the regular people of their time. NFTs are similar in this light, where we can enjoy pieces at home rather than say, visiting galleries or museums of unattainable art. \n\n\n\nAdditional querystring params (use when viewing in a separate window) \n\n* fullsize=true (33 megapixel output) \n* colourcorrect=false \n* grain=false \n* border=false \n\n\n\nLicenses included in source. Relying on: \n\n* PIXIJS for drawing \n* JSTS for geometry functions \n* chromajs for colour functions \n* noise and gaussian helpers from p5js ",
