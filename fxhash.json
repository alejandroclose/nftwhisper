            "description": "NEBELWALD is the first series of about 10 different tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years. \n\nThis project explores a minimalist approach to tree naturalism using a recursive algorithm and includes three traits: a density layer of fog, a measure of tree growth, and the softness of snowfall.\n\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png.\n\nArtist notes:\n\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nOnce I experienced it in a dense fog, which was amazing! beautiful and mysterious at the same time. This has definitely inspired the NEBELWALD work series.\n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: http://lumicon.de/e-art/project/nebelwald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND\n",

            "description": "It has always been a goal of mine to incorporate the worlds of physical and digital art together in a piece. And with circumscript I am the closest I've ever been. Circumscript uses a custom shader written to mix and \"dilute\" the colors on the canvas, thus creating a very physical feeling piece.\n\nThis dilution can be more or less depending on the edition, but always plays a huge role in the feel of the piece.\n\n\nHappy new year.\n\n\n----\n\n\n[m] or [double tap] : opens the export/settings menu, use this menu to change the resolution, and make sure to press the reload button if you do.\n[holding down] : zooms in on a certain area of the piece, depending on where your mouse/finger is. Use this feature to expore the complex textures of the piece in more detail, it's highly recommended to do this on a higher resolution setting.\n\nThe outputs can vary slighty per device, as there's a slight difference in how certain math gets interpreted on different devices with shaders.\n\n\n----\n\n\nMade with p5.js and webgl by Wouter Missler in 2022/3.",

In that sense it is also a reaction against both skeuomorphism, or mimicking older media in digital form, and the push towards ever increasing fidelity and resolution. The project uses Military perspective, a form of oblique projection, or 45° - 45° axonometric projection, because these angels can approximated fittingly by square pixel grid. \n\nPress s, m, l, x for exporting an image with increasing resolution.\nPress p for pause.\nPress r for refresh.\n\nMade with P5.js by @introspect0r\n",

            "description": "NEBELWALD is the first series of about 10 different tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years. \n\nThis project explores a minimalist approach to tree naturalism using a recursive algorithm and includes three traits: a density layer of fog, a measure of tree growth, and the softness of snowfall.\n\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png.\n\nArtist notes:\n\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nOnce I experienced it in a dense fog, which was amazing! beautiful and mysterious at the same time. This has definitely inspired the NEBELWALD work series.\n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: http://lumicon.de/e-art/project/nebelwald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND\n",
