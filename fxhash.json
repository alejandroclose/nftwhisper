            "description": "Field Sketch\n\nThis is a 100% generative abstract project. I'm experimenting again with sketchy rough drawing and trying to create something that looks like it could have been created by hand. There are seven composition types that produce different styles of output.\n\nThis project uses the fx(params) WYSIWYG functionality so the minter will get exactly the output they configure.\n\nExplanation of Numeric Params (all have range 0-100):\n\nXBounds - low values have primary structures near the middle of the horizontal axis\n\nYBounds - low values have primary structures near the middle of the vertical axis. For Quantized composition types this also affects the vertical level of the vanishing points.\n\nStructureSmooth - low values have a more complex global structure\n\nDetailSmooth - low values have a more complex fine structure\n\nSegmentLength - low values have more but shorter lines drawn\n\nAngleVariation - low values have more coherent line direction\n\nColorNoise - the higher the value the more random color variation for each line segment\n\nOrder - low values have the lines follow the flow fields in a more chaotic fashion\n\nBlur - higher values will use blur on top and bottom of output to simulate depth of field\n\nSymmetry - The possible values are no symmetry, 3, 4, 6, or 12. Any symmetry will be imperfect - it guides the construction of the composition but other random factors will usually prevent an exactly symmetrical result.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThere are some keyboard operations available.\n\nClick on the output and use these keys to affect it:\n's' - save at current resolution\n'2' - change to 2000 x 2000 resolution\n'3' - change to 3000 x 3000 resolution\n...\n'8' - change to 8000 x 8000 resolution\n\nNote that at higher resolutions there will be some minor variation in output.\n\nCopyright 2023 Jeff Clark\n--------------------------\n100% generative\n\nAll drawing and geometric code created by Jeff Clark using standard javascript and canvas 2D api. Perlin noise was used with support from perlin.js at https://codepen.io/sixsided/pen/emxxea.js\n\n",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it.

            "description": "We are filling our one and only world with our endless cities, roads and structures, for as far as the eye can see. We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it. Thank you very much for collecting and for your continuous support.\n\n10% of primary and secondary sales will go to fxhash team; thank you for what you are doing.\n\nSelf reserved pieces are for promised gifts to my collectors.\n\nPress S to save as PNG.

            "description": "“Matriisi” is a generative artwork exploring the artistic, visual and conceptual possibilities of matrices in generative abstract art.\n\nIt is designed to be a digital artwork, to be viewed from a high quality monitor or tv, or printed and framed. Contemporary life is getting more and more digitalized and almost everyone has a device with a high resolution screen. With this artwork I am aiming to enable art collectors, traditional and digital, to have an artwork they can enjoy from their screen or tv, and save wall space for traditional hand made art objects.\n\nThe artwork is orientation agnostic, there is no preferred way it is supposed to be looked or hanged.\n \n\nThe artwork is based on set of number matrices used as main compositional structure. This data is then interpreted to draw the visual elements: matrices of lines and dots. As a play on digital vs handmade, lines and shapes imitating drawing highlight the forms made by the matrices. \n\nThere are 10 different colour palettes, that can be also mixed together. These colours draw inspiration from different eras and styles of art. \n\nAs the artwork is developed based on visual variety, there will are no separate features, as these would add limitations to the range of the generator.\n\n40 iterations are reserved for live minting in the gallery during the exhibition.\n\nMatriisi is shown in Luisa Catucci Gallery in Berlin between 1.9.2022 and 1.10.2022 in the generative art exhibition “Improbable Iterations” together with Joonas Toivonen aka Toiminto. He is showing his artwork “Fragment Assembler” also out on FX(Hash). Welcome to the opening of the exhibition on 1.9.2022 16-19pm @ Allerstraße 38, 12049, Berlin. Both artists will be present.\n\nControls in live view:\n-Pressing j exports the current image as jpeg\n-Pressing p exports the current image as png\n\nTo change the detail level one can access the pixel density of render by adding &pixDens=3 to the end of the URL in live view. You can of course put number other than 4 also. I it renders just a black image, you have to lower the number, since it is then too large for WEBGL to render.\n\n\nMade with p5.js\n\nAntti Pussinen, in Berlin 26.8. 2022\n",

Instead of my usual interactive and animated designs, I created a drawing that gives the impression of lithographic printing on 2D black paper, where textures remain static. I wanted the nature objects to have a slightly dark, somewhat Fauvist style. I sought a balance between their depressive nature and the hopeful tranquility of natural light sources, which evoked the feeling I was searching for.\n\n*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as png.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.\n\n“Stratification of the Orthogonal”\n“Agora of Timeless”\n“Surely, There is an Exit”\n\nEveryone who owns the above collections is entitled to a free mint right in this collection.
