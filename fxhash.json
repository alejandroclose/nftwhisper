            "description": "When I was a child walking with my father in the park, he once told me if I could hear the trees talking to each other. I listened, and in the noise of the leaves and seeds in the wind, I truly recognized their languages and voices. I was so overwhelmed by the depth and diversity of the world and the creatures that inhabit it, that it is still one of my most vivid memories. \n\nWhen I walk through parks or forests, I always listen to what they say. It is unlikely that I will ever be able to engage in their dialogue, but it is always like a touch of the magical immensity of life.\n\nWild Palms is the name of a gallery of our friends with whom it is always a pleasure to talk in the language of humans, and they have a garden right in the gallery.\nIn the project we mix childhood memories and friendship, the aesthetics of woodcuts, Polaroid and hand-printed photos with echoes of the digital voice of our present.\n\nThanks to YulikolaY for getting the code ready for production.\n\nMade with love, AI and p5.js code\n\nJanuary, 2023",

Sometimes, you'll catch it at night - with lights strung on the tree!\n\nThe amount of color in spring and fall, snow in winter, fruit on and off the tree will all vary. There are four spring bloom palettes, four trunk colors, and seven types of fruit. \n\nPress ’s’ to save a screenshot. Image size is 1000x1000px\nPress ’p’ to pause/resume.\n\nTo render a variation at a new size, open live view and append '?size=#' to the end of the URL. The new size may be from 100 to 3,000.
