            "description": "The story behind this collection is that there isn't really a story behind this collection. It is the result of play, tinkering, and curiosity.\n\nOne of the beautiful things about generative art is how we can achieve drastically different results simply by modifying a few parameters or lines of code. As my first release here on fxhash was 'Sabler', it felt fitting that my release for #fxhashturnsone would itself be a modified version of that 'Sabler' algorithm, albeit giving drastically different results.\n\nIt is notable for the fact that this is perhaps my most 'chaotic' collection yet, letting go of carefully considered proportions, angles and positioning and here leaving that in the hands of the computer. In a way, this simple act represents several design decisions I never would have imagined myself making a year ago, highlighting my growth as a generative artist over the past year.\n\nIt is also a reflection of the inspiration gained from many of the artists and boundary-pushers in the space that each time unlock and encourage creations beyond the immediate comfort zone. For that, this is a 'Thank You' to all of you.\n\nWith that, here's to many more years of generative beauty and inspiration on fxhash and beyond.\n\nAs with previous collections, I highly recommend viewing the images at full size and savouring the details and the chaos up close. Pressing 'S' will save a 6000 x 6000 px PNG file.\n\n50% of primary sales will be donated to the Processing Foundation.",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "We have an impossible plan:\nTo negate any plan.\nLet ideas drop, and bloom\nand their fruits, crystalize.\n\nFeel the call of intention,\nlaser focus on this, not that;\nOr let it dilute in randomness,\na liberated slide left and right.\n\nStacking sketches and notes\nwe look at a mirror as we type,\nare we looking for something\nor has something already found us?\n\nWe move in oblique patterns,\nfinding meaning in the fray.\nIf our art takes on a life of its own,\ndo we simply guide it on its way?\n\n________________\n\n\nConcept:\n\nObliqua is a visual meditation on a generative artist's dilemma, the tension between conscious search and fortuitous find. And a question for both artist and observer: What is \"meaning\", if there's any, and who is in charge of that? By evoking (apparent?) dualities such as incipient/completed, natural/artificial, flat/volumetric, and outdated/advanced..., the piece welcomes ambiguity as a dear and helpful friend.\n\n\nMinting Params:\n\nSome parameters define geometric structure and layout while others control more stylistic or expressive features. Color palettes have been composed and chosen as they are presented, but they can be slightly adjusted with contrast, saturate and brightness params. Some style options can be toggled on/off with your keyboard (i.e. you may want to toggle grain off for printing). Please read below.\n\n\nLive mode controls:\n\nPress the following keys to download the artwork at different sizes:\n- S: Current size (default 2100 x 2970 px)\n- 1: Small, 2100 x 2970 px\n- 2: Medium, 4200 x 5940 px\n- 3: Large, 6300 x 8910 px\n- 4: Largest, 8400 x 11880 px\n- V: SVG (multiple-file download)\n\nAnd these other ones for toggling style options:\n- L: Toggle Glow\n- R: Toggle Grain\n- H: Toggle Shadow\n- W: Toggle Worn\n- F: Toggle Frame\n\n\nNotes:\n\n- Some outputs can be quite intensive in terms of computation, especially at higher resolutions, so they require a capable, relatively modern computer and browser. Best viewed in Chrome. Firefox and Edge should work too, although slower. Safari is not supported. Please make sure the artwork is rendered properly on your device and browser before minting.\n- SVG can be downloaded for plotting. For convenience, the download is split into different files for lines and fills. Fills will always be exported as solid colors.\n\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\nThanks everyone who provided help directly or indirectly by publishing useful articles, online-forums threads, and giving support and feedback on Twitter, Discord, and elsewhere. Special thanks to the authors of some code libraries included in this project:\n\n- p5.js\n- p5.grain\n- svgcanvas\n- quadtree-ts\n\n\n----------\n\nDaniel Aguilar, April 2023\nTwitter: @protozoo\nInstagram: @prtzart\nWebsite: https://protozoo.xyz\n\nNFT License 2.0\n\n----------\n\nSigned prints:\n\n- Unique, signed high-quality prints are available for this project (1 for iteration)\n- Collectors minting at the Dutch Auction's start price (highest) are entitled to their iteration's print at no additional cost\n- Collectors minting at lower prices can order their print for 120€ (EUR and XTZ welcome)\n- Print requests/orders can be made within one month after auction date.\n\n",
