            "description": "\n\n\n\nIn Argentina there is a very young and talented music producer called BIZARRAP.\n\nHe is very famous for the BZRP Music Sessions, which are tracks in collaboration with international artists that Bizarrap produces in his studio, which also serves as a recording studio for the official video clip of the track.\n\nIn these sessions the artists have the freedom to express themselves in ways that perhaps the industry doesn't allow them because they have an image to sell, or the freedom to deliver whatever they want.\n\nFor example, in the Music Session with Nicky Jam, the Puerto Rican artist sings rap in Spanish, English and reggaeton, all in the same song.\n\nInspired by this concept I decided to launch my CR Art Sessions format. The idea is to take previous works and reconvert them or give me the freedom to play with the algorithms and explore new options and parameters to reach their limits or to obtain something different but with the same essence.\n\nThe CR Art Sessions //1 is based on my first fx(hash) project called Geoetris. \n\nThe same algorithm was slightly modified to produce 3 different types of art that the user will be able to visualize. \n1. The first type is an extreme version of the Geoetris project, where the parameters were modified to have blend between the pieces and generate many more elements on screen. \n2. The second is a composition of circles and squares, where there is a very simple rule that can only sometimes be broken and that is that the rectangles start in the middle of the circle. \n3. The third is a version where the larger geometric shapes are not filled and only their silhouette is marked.\n\n-----\n\nReserves: All 'Geoetris' owners and 40-40 slots for 'Yo automata' and 'Isomeric Doppelgangers' owners\n\n-----\n\nRoyalties: 50% to minter\n\n-----\n\nControls:\n\nExplore each art variant with the '1', '2', '3' keys\n\nThe 'e' key exports the current canvas\n\nThe 's' key exports the image in 3200x4000 px resolution\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2022)\n\nMade with P5js and <3.",

            "description": "\"Bored Computer Screen\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Art Basel, Basel 2022\n\n\nBored Computer Screen (BCS) is a direct descendant of Specter👻pixel⬛latte☕, where the central idea is agent and displacement. In BCS, there are agents—the small moving circles—that get their colors ripped away by the surrounding pixels. Though they occur on the same screen space, they are separated in their own cells, a simultaneous multiverse of sorts. In some iterations, a very clear voronoi pattern will appear. I didn't consciously strive for this look. It's what naturally happens, when you try to divide space, so that the borders occur exactly in between the closest neighbor. When I first saw this pattern emerge, I wanted to see how far I could get the distinct cells to influence each other. The idea that the same algorithmic processes can happen many times but still separately in a single piece has always interested me (and explored in the Infinite Browse series). BCS is an extension of that, albeit a little more chaotic.\n\nNote:\n- Best experience on browsers and devices with support for WebGL2 \n\nMade by Sam Tsao (@sam___tsao) with P5, P5Fbo and perlinjs.\n",

            "description": "\"Bored Computer Screen\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Art Basel, Basel 2022\n\n\nBored Computer Screen (BCS) is a direct descendant of Specter👻pixel⬛latte☕, where the central idea is agent and displacement. In BCS, there are agents—the small moving circles—that get their colors ripped away by the surrounding pixels. Though they occur on the same screen space, they are separated in their own cells, a simultaneous multiverse of sorts. In some iterations, a very clear voronoi pattern will appear. I didn't consciously strive for this look. It's what naturally happens, when you try to divide space, so that the borders occur exactly in between the closest neighbor. When I first saw this pattern emerge, I wanted to see how far I could get the distinct cells to influence each other. The idea that the same algorithmic processes can happen many times but still separately in a single piece has always interested me (and explored in the Infinite Browse series). BCS is an extension of that, albeit a little more chaotic.\n\nNote:\n- Best experience on browsers and devices with support for WebGL2 \n\nMade by Sam Tsao (@sam___tsao) with P5, P5Fbo and perlinjs.\n",

            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

            "description": "\"Dreamcatcher Forest\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Art Basel, Basel 2022. The illustration in this work draws inspiration from Native American dreamcatchers, a protective talisman crafted from beautifully intricate patterns of woven thread, built from natural materials & colorful beads.\n\nDreamcatchers are used to protect dreamers while they sleep. Good dreams are able to slip through the web to meet the sleeper beneath, while bad dreams are trapped and prevented.\n\n- Use the \"S\" key to save a PNG image.\n- Use the \"P\" key to export a print-quality image.",
