This piece of art is a tribute to the launch, inviting you to immerse yourself in its dynamic visuals.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the realm of the lines, there rested a world overlooked by the atmospheric views of hills, christened as Harmonious Hill. A world, where the sun, the moon, and the stars were born out of infinite circles effortlessly looping. A world that was bathed utterly in monochrome hues of the cosmic palette.\n\nIt was once teeming with life, laughter, and colors before the great apocalypse. A disaster so colossal, that it wiped out all color, replacing it with an eternal melancholy of black and white.\n\nThe Harmonious Hill, though stripped of its vibrancy, stood resiliently against time. The skies were filled with perpetual fog, a reminder of the long-lost days. The vertical and curvy hills, once gliding into vibrant valleys, now housed derelict and deserted towns.\n\nThe Taiga trees, bound by the monochrome, delineated themselves as large silhouettes against the never-ending horizontal line of the sky, whispering tales of the catastrophic past to the lonely artists. The haunting echoes of the past continued to reverberate, ironically absorbed by these mute trees.\n\nAmid the somber monotones, the lone survivors were the birds. Soaring across the gloomy apartment buildings, their elegiac songs spun tales of lost epochs in the cold air, threading through the silent trees and melancholy fog.\n\nOne day, a new phenomenon graced the hills. The everyday circle loop of the sun enlarged, as though trying to consume the sullen world. Fear encapsulated the folks of the Harmonious Hill as they watched the sun spiral, assuming it to be the second apocalypse in line.\n\nIn the foreboding silence, a tiny speck of white emerged from the enormous sun, descending to the sky. As it journeyed closer, the birds serenaded its descent. It was a seed, glowing white and vibrant against the black skies.\n\nUpon reaching the cold ground, it burrowed into the heart of Harmonious Hill. Silence fell once more; the sun receded to its normal loop. Days turned into nights, and nights into days.\n\nThen, in the stillness of a frosty dawn, the seed burst forth from the ice-cold soil. A majestic tree, unlike any Taiga trees, flourished. It sprouted not just leaves, but colors. Colors of hope, resilience, and rejuvenation. It shone vibrantly, piercing through the eternal fog.\n\nThe birds sang, and their melodies turned from dirges to ditties of joy. The people in the houses awoken from their centuries-old slumber, stepping out for the first time into the fresh, thawing world. As they saw the growing tree of colors, they weaved stories of a new beginning, a world reborn.\n\nIn the realm of lines and monochromes, the world of Harmonious Hill thus welcomed hope, banishing its perpetual sadness into a tale of survival and rebirth. The apocalypse became a fable of transcendence, of how desolate lives could burgeon anew, in the miraculous world of art.\n\nTo navigate and interact with the artwork, here are the key controls:\n\nS Key: Press 'S' to save the image content of the current frame.

            "description": "GuilCity is the beginning of an exciting journey bringing Guillaume Cornet’s densely-packed cities into the generative realm with the help of Matthew’s (@frostbitten’s) magic touch.\n\nMatthew—with his background in coding and animation—enables a new opportunity to experience these cities like never before. Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey! \n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you’ve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n—\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n—\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n• https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n—\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others’ skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci à tous! Cheers!\n  - Guillaume Cornet, Matthew Seremet",

Inspired by the ethereal interplay between dreams and reality, this masterpiece conjures flowers that dwell not in earthly gardens but in the imagination's boundless fields.\n\nEach bloom, a digital mirage, mirrors the complexity of human perception, capturing the myriad souls in its petals. Here, flowers are not merely seen; they are felt, as they embody the diverse essences of life, painted in strokes of unseen colors and shapes.\n\n\"The Soul of Flowers\" is a digital garden where each flower narrates its own poetic story, a fusion of art and technology that invites viewers to wander through a realm of beauty, redefining the boundaries between the virtual and the real.",

            "description": "Step into the vibrant world of FXHash 2, where art meets innovation! This piece of art is a tribute to the launch, inviting you to immerse yourself in its dynamic visuals.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the realm of the lines, there rested a world overlooked by the atmospheric views of hills, christened as Harmonious Hill. A world, where the sun, the moon, and the stars were born out of infinite circles effortlessly looping. A world that was bathed utterly in monochrome hues of the cosmic palette.\n\nIt was once teeming with life, laughter, and colors before the great apocalypse. A disaster so colossal, that it wiped out all color, replacing it with an eternal melancholy of black and white.\n\nThe Harmonious Hill, though stripped of its vibrancy, stood resiliently against time. The skies were filled with perpetual fog, a reminder of the long-lost days. The vertical and curvy hills, once gliding into vibrant valleys, now housed derelict and deserted towns.\n\nThe Taiga trees, bound by the monochrome, delineated themselves as large silhouettes against the never-ending horizontal line of the sky, whispering tales of the catastrophic past to the lonely artists. The haunting echoes of the past continued to reverberate, ironically absorbed by these mute trees.\n\nAmid the somber monotones, the lone survivors were the birds. Soaring across the gloomy apartment buildings, their elegiac songs spun tales of lost epochs in the cold air, threading through the silent trees and melancholy fog.\n\nOne day, a new phenomenon graced the hills. The everyday circle loop of the sun enlarged, as though trying to consume the sullen world. Fear encapsulated the folks of the Harmonious Hill as they watched the sun spiral, assuming it to be the second apocalypse in line.\n\nIn the foreboding silence, a tiny speck of white emerged from the enormous sun, descending to the sky. As it journeyed closer, the birds serenaded its descent. It was a seed, glowing white and vibrant against the black skies.\n\nUpon reaching the cold ground, it burrowed into the heart of Harmonious Hill. Silence fell once more; the sun receded to its normal loop. Days turned into nights, and nights into days.\n\nThen, in the stillness of a frosty dawn, the seed burst forth from the ice-cold soil. A majestic tree, unlike any Taiga trees, flourished. It sprouted not just leaves, but colors. Colors of hope, resilience, and rejuvenation. It shone vibrantly, piercing through the eternal fog.\n\nThe birds sang, and their melodies turned from dirges to ditties of joy. The people in the houses awoken from their centuries-old slumber, stepping out for the first time into the fresh, thawing world. As they saw the growing tree of colors, they weaved stories of a new beginning, a world reborn.\n\nIn the realm of lines and monochromes, the world of Harmonious Hill thus welcomed hope, banishing its perpetual sadness into a tale of survival and rebirth. The apocalypse became a fable of transcendence, of how desolate lives could burgeon anew, in the miraculous world of art.\n\nTo navigate and interact with the artwork, here are the key controls:\n\nS Key: Press 'S' to save the image content of the current frame. This will capture the artwork without the frame.\n\nG Key: To create a GIF capturing the last 5 seconds of the artwork's movement, simply press 'G'. This will generate a GIF file showcasing the dynamic changes over the last few seconds.\n\nFeel free to explore the artwork and use these keys to capture your favorite moments or visuals!

            "description": "Step into the vibrant world of FXHash 2, where art meets innovation! This piece of art is a tribute to the launch, inviting you to immerse yourself in its dynamic visuals.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the realm of the lines, there rested a world overlooked by the atmospheric views of hills, christened as Harmonious Hill. A world, where the sun, the moon, and the stars were born out of infinite circles effortlessly looping. A world that was bathed utterly in monochrome hues of the cosmic palette.\n\nIt was once teeming with life, laughter, and colors before the great apocalypse. A disaster so colossal, that it wiped out all color, replacing it with an eternal melancholy of black and white.\n\nThe Harmonious Hill, though stripped of its vibrancy, stood resiliently against time. The skies were filled with perpetual fog, a reminder of the long-lost days. The vertical and curvy hills, once gliding into vibrant valleys, now housed derelict and deserted towns.\n\nThe Taiga trees, bound by the monochrome, delineated themselves as large silhouettes against the never-ending horizontal line of the sky, whispering tales of the catastrophic past to the lonely artists. The haunting echoes of the past continued to reverberate, ironically absorbed by these mute trees.\n\nAmid the somber monotones, the lone survivors were the birds. Soaring across the gloomy apartment buildings, their elegiac songs spun tales of lost epochs in the cold air, threading through the silent trees and melancholy fog.\n\nOne day, a new phenomenon graced the hills. The everyday circle loop of the sun enlarged, as though trying to consume the sullen world. Fear encapsulated the folks of the Harmonious Hill as they watched the sun spiral, assuming it to be the second apocalypse in line.\n\nIn the foreboding silence, a tiny speck of white emerged from the enormous sun, descending to the sky. As it journeyed closer, the birds serenaded its descent. It was a seed, glowing white and vibrant against the black skies.\n\nUpon reaching the cold ground, it burrowed into the heart of Harmonious Hill. Silence fell once more; the sun receded to its normal loop. Days turned into nights, and nights into days.\n\nThen, in the stillness of a frosty dawn, the seed burst forth from the ice-cold soil. A majestic tree, unlike any Taiga trees, flourished. It sprouted not just leaves, but colors. Colors of hope, resilience, and rejuvenation. It shone vibrantly, piercing through the eternal fog.\n\nThe birds sang, and their melodies turned from dirges to ditties of joy. The people in the houses awoken from their centuries-old slumber, stepping out for the first time into the fresh, thawing world. As they saw the growing tree of colors, they weaved stories of a new beginning, a world reborn.\n\nIn the realm of lines and monochromes, the world of Harmonious Hill thus welcomed hope, banishing its perpetual sadness into a tale of survival and rebirth. The apocalypse became a fable of transcendence, of how desolate lives could burgeon anew, in the miraculous world of art.\n\nTo navigate and interact with the artwork, here are the key controls:\n\nS Key: Press 'S' to save the image content of the current frame.

This piece of art is a tribute to the launch, inviting you to immerse yourself in its dynamic visuals.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the realm of the lines, there rested a world overlooked by the atmospheric views of hills, christened as Harmonious Hill. A world, where the sun, the moon, and the stars were born out of infinite circles effortlessly looping.

A disaster so colossal, that it wiped out all color, replacing it with an eternal melancholy of black and white.\n\nThe Harmonious Hill, though stripped of its vibrancy, stood resiliently against time.

Inspired by the ethereal interplay between dreams and reality, this masterpiece conjures flowers that dwell not in earthly gardens but in the imagination's boundless fields.\n\nEach bloom, a digital mirage, mirrors the complexity of human perception, capturing the myriad souls in its petals. Here, flowers are not merely seen; they are felt, as they embody the diverse essences of life, painted in strokes of unseen colors and shapes.\n\n\"The Soul of Flowers\" is a digital garden where each flower narrates its own poetic story, a fusion of art and technology that invites viewers to wander through a realm of beauty, redefining the boundaries between the virtual and the real.",

Here, flowers are not merely seen; they are felt, as they embody the diverse essences of life, painted in strokes of unseen colors and shapes.\n\n\"The Soul of Flowers\" is a digital garden where each flower narrates its own poetic story, a fusion of art and technology that invites viewers to wander through a realm of beauty, redefining the boundaries between the virtual and the real.",
