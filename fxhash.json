            "description": "Whether by choice or circumstance, we often find our lives thrust into uncertainty. We're resilient, though — we find patterns in the chaos, deciphering and unraveling it piece by piece until a new comfort emerges. `gradient descent` is my expression of that cyclical flow that comes to dominate our lives.\n\nThe piece starts with comfort, a smooth gradient chosen from a curated palette. As the animation runs, that gradient is mutated by a unique sequence of linear transformations - slice, skew or stride on an underlying grid - as it descends into uncertainty. After a time the animation will reverse, peeling back each transformation and returning to comfort before beginning anew.\n\nThe menu - which can be accessed with a double click or Escape - gives you extensive control of the experience. I'd encourage you to explore these settings — they transform the feel of the piece, allowing you to adapt it to match your environment or mood. Any setting that can be changed in the menu can also be provided as a URL parameter - there's a button in the menu to export them all.\n\nBuilt with raw WebGL 1.0, optimised to run smoothly on most devices.\n\nBest viewed in full screen on large format displays.\n\n||| controls\n\n[hold space] ⇝ speed up\n[esc/2xclick] ⇝ toggle menu\n[g] ⇝ toggle gallery mode\n[p] ⇝ toggle pause\n[s] ⇝ capture current frame\n[a] ⇝ capture all keyframes\n[8/9/0/-] ⇝ change viewport\n\n||| settings\n\nAll settings are configurable via the interactive menu.

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space.

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry.

The inner nucleus \nthat provides with energy and force. And the intermediate shape, particular and unique in every piece, essence of the new being, that moves pulsatile,\nreaching the inner core and expanding again.\n\ntwo philosophical or hermethic concepts have been used in this representation. First the use of cosmological structures and dynamics (macrocosmos) to represent\nlife creation at smaller size (microcosmos). This concept has been used in numerous hermetic books to explain how life perpetuates itself and to teach that we can\nunderstand ourselves studying nature. The other traditional concept represented in this piece is \"Logos as creator\". The particles that build every structure are made\nof letters, symbols or numbers, following the hermetic/alchemical knowledge that all things were created by Logos or the sacred words. This concept is universal in almost\nevery religious tradition. For example, Bereshit, first word of Torah, widely translated as \"From the beginning\", has been interpreted by some cabalists with an alternative \nmeaning such as \"creation was made using the alphabet and fire\" (\"bara\" - creation, \"aleph\" - first letter of the jewish alphabet, \"shin\" - fire and \"tav\" - last letter of the alphabet).\n\nfor more info, read fxtext \"The creative process behind GENESIS\". \n--\n\nWatch it full screen for better amusement.\nWait 5 seconds for motion of intermediate structure to start.\n\nFeatures:\n- 2 loading covers: polygon and alphabet.\n- 5 palettes: light and dark, tricolor (one color for each structure), random colored structures (structures colored by a combination of limited random colors),\nall random (each particle position has its random color), random colored particles (each particle colored by a combination of limited random colors).\n- 3 particles types: alphabet, symbols and numbers.\n- 3 types of initial zoom view: zoom in, regular zoom, zoom out. \n- 1.953.125 possible and unique intermediate structures. \n\nKeyboard controls:\n- Use ARROWS to move the camera on the x and z axis. Right and Left for x axis and Up and Down for z axis. \n- Press \"m\" to show/hide the control MENU.  \n- Press \"p\" to pause/restart the animation.\n- Press \"s\" to save an image (.png).\n- Press \"g\" to save a 5 second GIF.\n- Press \"o\" to hide/show the outter structure.\n- Press \"i\" to hide/show the nucleus. \n- Press \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"5\", \"6\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\" or \"0\" to adjust the density, attenuation or emissions parameters from the particles systems.

Simple patterns, shapes, textures, and colors are arranged in randomly selected ways. Overlaying shapes distort and blend, breaking these objects apart and causing complex forms to emerge. Combining these individual features together results in varying outcomes, from surprisingly simple to wildly chaotic.\n\n---------------\n\nControls:\nPress 1-6 to change the scale of the canvas (1 = default, 2500px x 2500px, 6 = 15,000px x 15,000px)\nS (or double tap on mobile): Save output at current size\nC: Toggle cutout shapes visibility\nH: Toggle cutout outlines visibility\nB: Iterate border sizes (none, default, 1.5x, 2x, 3x)\nT: Toggle texture visibility\nF: Toggle fullscreen\nAdd the url params x and y to set custom dimensions.

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

In this series, urban ensembles are generated with a simple click. With each iteration appears a new densely built city block. Graced with impeccable geometrical lines, devoid of any human presence, these buildings remind us of brutalist utopias like Le Corbusier’s Cité radieuse or Niemeyer’s Brasilia. But despite their clearly modernist feel, there is something hauntingly primitive about them. They could be either New Mexican adobe pueblos, Minoan palaces, or Turkish troglodyte dwellings. Both carved and sculpted, these Ghormenghasts of concrete float in a realm out of time, like in some architect’s dream.\n\nThe purpose of this creative work is to generate 3D architectural projects that could be implemented in the real world. The accelerating lives that we live, complicated by growing and unpredictable environmental crises, call for an enhanced capacity to come up quickly with new architectural solutions adapted to different contexts. From computer assisted design to 3D printing, from augmented reality to real-life housing, from sculpture to architecture, this work aims at bridging the gap between the virtual and the tangible.\n\nWorking as a visual artist, David Umemoto draws inspiration from his training as an architect. He has been using low-tech methods for a long time, refining his talent for elegant simple shapes and combinatory constructions. Now, poured concrete and home-made moulds are giving way to zero-gravity rotating models. The skills he developed while working with real objects find a new playground in the virtual realm.\n",
