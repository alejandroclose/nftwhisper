            "description": "THIS IS NOT AN ARTWORK (at least not intentional)!\n\nThis NFT acts as a donation/funding mechanism for a new project template Git repo, providing a compact, ready-to-go scaffolding for generative art projects aimed at the fx(hash) platform/marketplace.\n\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/fxhash-tpl\n\nThis template evolved over time and has served as basis for some of the author's own NFT projects (https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/toxi). The template is aimed at TypeScript (but can be easily adapted to plain JavaScript) and, at the time of writing, uses Vite as dev & build tool, ensuring an altogether great & speedy workflow with minimal fuzz.\n\n(In the future, I'm aiming to provide an alternative version for more advanced hybrid projects using TypeScript, Zig (https://ziglang.org) and WebAssembly (https://webassembly.org/)...)\n\nFramework agnostic\n\nEven though several packages from the https://thi.ng/umbrella ecosystem are used to provide various essential overarching functionality, the template is organized in such a way that the main parts are completely framework-agnostic. You should be able to easily plug in your own toolkit of choice, however I cannot promise to provide support for this myself (though happy to accept PRs, also in terms of further docs, how-tos, guides etc.)\n\nExample project\n\nA tiny, fully documented throwaway example sketch is included, illustrating the following:\n\n- Overall project structure & build commands\n- FXhash related setup\n- Static & dynamic configuration and state (re)initialization (via dependency graph)\n- FXhash PRNG wrapper & utilities\n- Canvas & SVG conversion/export/download\n- 2D geometry creation, transformation & drawing\n- Basic vector algebra example usage\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\n\n- space :  pause/play animation\n- x : download canvas as PNG\n- s : download SVG version\n\nIn case of doubt, it's this example project what is used here for minting. The funding, however, will be used for the further maintenance of both this project template and supporting my other open source work. 20% are also donated to the FXhash development team itself.\n\nThank you for your support! 🙏😍",

Each of these moments link us to the same boundless and enveloping interconnectedness that persists across space and time: the infinite source of our deepest aspirations.\n\nLike the feeling of simple bliss, ‘Love’ portrays the visceral radiant light and warmth of our innermost joys. By taking a moment to open ourselves up, these swirling worlds of weightless and seemingly infinite brush strokes invite us to slow down and dwell in prismatic intuitive swells.\n\nIn doing so, we may find the immense and omnipresent love that needs only our awareness to be felt.\n\n__________\n\nPress 1-9 to load at different scales (1 = 2,000x2,000 (default), 9 = 10,000x10,000)\nWhen zoomed in, once the output is fully loaded, you can click and drag to move around the canvas\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'B' to toggle the background texture on or off\nPress 'A' to toggle the loading animation (recommended for very large scales)\n\nCreated with p5.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n__________\nTENDER x teaboswell\nMay 2022",

            "description": "Crystalyxes have seven features which approximately describe their configuration, behavior and appearance. Similar to their predecessors, monocells and chromoplasms, they start from one of four basic primitive shapes and develop in several stages through application of growth rules. Symmetrical crystalyxes can evolve up to stage 4, while irregular ones are known to go even higher. Note that higher stage crystalyxes are GPU intensive to display and interact with. Each crystalyx has both structural as well as behavioral features. Structural ones include starting primitive (tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron), stage (1-6) and order (symmetric, irregular), with many growth-related features remaining hidden. Behavioral features include reconfiguration of node connections and modulation of node distances. Finally, crystalyxes are distinguished by their mineral composition (lapis lazuli, emerald, ruby) and color mode (3-bit, monochrome).\n\nPress o_o for recording an animation clip in GIF format (available only in fullscreen / live mode).
