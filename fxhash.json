The editions will range from open, sparse forests to lush, dense, leafy wonderlands. Fall editions may render as Klimpt-style birch forests - my original inspiration for this work.\n\nBest viewed on a computer. It may take a few seconds to start drawing and, depending on complexity, several minutes to finish rendering. In live view, press ‚Äôs‚Äô to save a screenshot. Image size is 2318x3000px.\n\nFeatures:\n- One of the four seasons\n- Rare 10% night version with 50/50 for normal fireflies or \"fire\" fireflies. Night will only be spring or summer.\n- Amount of atmosphere/haze\n- Horizon line near the middle or 30% \"high horizon\" near the top\n- Tint from one of 8 light and 7 shadow colors\n- Strength of the light and shadow color tint\n- Mixed tree trunks or 30% all birch\n- 50/50 moss on tree trunks\n- One of 8 flower colors in spring or summer\n- One of 4 perspective transforms\n- Straight, curved out, or 30% curved inward trunks\n- 50/50 grass in fall or winter\n- 85% will have flowers in spring and summer\n- 95% will have underbrush\n- 50/50 clouds or solid background\n- 50/50 solid background will be vertical or swirls\n- Ground hill height\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Matt Perkins, hello@mattperkins.me, @nudoru on Twitter.

            "description": "THIS IS NOT AN ARTWORK (at least not intentional)!\n\nThis NFT acts as a donation/funding mechanism for a new project template Git repo, providing a compact, ready-to-go scaffolding for generative art projects aimed at the fx(hash) platform/marketplace.\n\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/fxhash-tpl\n\nThis template evolved over time and has served as basis for some of the author's own NFT projects (https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/toxi). The template is aimed at TypeScript (but can be easily adapted to plain JavaScript) and, at the time of writing, uses Vite as dev & build tool, ensuring an altogether great & speedy workflow with minimal fuzz.\n\n(In the future, I'm aiming to provide an alternative version for more advanced hybrid projects using TypeScript, Zig (https://ziglang.org) and WebAssembly (https://webassembly.org/)...)\n\nFramework agnostic\n\nEven though several packages from the https://thi.ng/umbrella ecosystem are used to provide various essential overarching functionality, the template is organized in such a way that the main parts are completely framework-agnostic. You should be able to easily plug in your own toolkit of choice, however I cannot promise to provide support for this myself (though happy to accept PRs, also in terms of further docs, how-tos, guides etc.)\n\nExample project\n\nA tiny, fully documented throwaway example sketch is included, illustrating the following:\n\n- Overall project structure & build commands\n- FXhash related setup\n- Static & dynamic configuration and state (re)initialization (via dependency graph)\n- FXhash PRNG wrapper & utilities\n- Canvas & SVG conversion/export/download\n- 2D geometry creation, transformation & drawing\n- Basic vector algebra example usage\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\n\n- space :  pause/play animation\n- x : download canvas as PNG\n- s : download SVG version\n\nIn case of doubt, it's this example project what is used here for minting. The funding, however, will be used for the further maintenance of both this project template and supporting my other open source work. 20% are also donated to the FXhash development team itself.\n\nThank you for your support! üôèüòç",
