            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

The focus of the observer is moved with the use of gradual animation in the gradients and occasional circles and/or rectangles connecting the shapes together through color.\n\nThe name minima stems from the origins of the composition, mostly taking inspiration from minimalism in its use of a few elements to form a composition greater than the sum of its parts. Less is more, as they say.\n\nThe point at the bottom right of the canvas resembles the end of a sentence. Like reading a book, you process the canvas in a similar way, moving from what pops the most to what the least.\n\nAs the reader of this canvas I hope you observe what happens to your focus as the colors gradually move across the screen. The animations themselves are looping based on a noised sine wave, which gives them imperfections, imperfections you can observe.\n\n----\n\nClick / Tap on the bar at the bottom of the canvas to open up the GUI, used to export your minima into any format you want. Either .png or .svg. Ready for printing, if you desire.\n\nps. there might be a secret keyboard shortcut...\n\n----\n\nMinima,\nWouter Missler, 2022,\np5js + webgl.",

            "description": "Shattered Obelisks began as a work that is dedicated to my habit of mindlessly drawing on paper when I am stressed, depressed or immersed in difficult thoughts.\n\nLike a patient undergoing psychotherapy and piecing together the causes of unconscious fears and anxieties, I and my artwork have assembled ourselves into something shaped, found order in the chaos and separated it from the external noise.\n\nIt took 3 months of continuous, obsessive work. I have developed a huge library, designed for hand-like drawing. The functionality of this library is four times larger than what is shown in this drop.\n\nI plan to put this library out into the public domain when I deem it complete, and hope that it will help someone express themselves through the creative process as much as it helped for me.\n\nIn case you've encountered a problem with inverted colours, try changing browser or disabling extensions. This problem only occurred once during testing on a massive amount of devices and was resolved by disabling extensions.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES BLOCK:\n\nNOTE 1: This artwork should be viewed at a browser scale of 100%. Reducing the scale will increase the amount of detail, but may unpredictably affect the preservation of the location of secondary objects.\n\nNOTE 2: This work can be printed on a plotter. Click S for saving it in .SVG.\nDetailed instructions and answers to possible questions can be found in the console output of the code.\n\nNOTE 3: This drop is the first one from the series of 3. It will be used as AL ticket in next drops of this series.\n\n@abakshonokoleg\n01.08.2022\nTech: P5.JS\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)",
