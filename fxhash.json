            "description": "Each monogrid artwork gets initialized with a start up algorithm that builds up a set of rectangles and fills them with pixels. There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

            "description": "When exploring new possibilities for a new work, I stumbled across an article on Pulsar map. Created by astronomer Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, this map serves as a galactic address of our solar system for any extra-terrestrial civilization to find using pulsars as signposts. Though chances of any kind of life form intercepting the map are slim, I'm still fascinated both by the possibility of another planetary civilization finding the map (and by extension our Earth), and the thought of using pulsar -- the remaining corpse of ancient massive star -- as universal signposts and landmarks to map the Earth position for any kind of possible civilization. To me there's something so poetic about this; it made me thinks of how small are we, the Humans, compared to those rotating pulsars that we use as mere landmarks to our location...let alone the whole universe. We are just floating stardust after all.\n\nIn this piece I use Lissajous curve array with randomized variable to position the stars and generate spline as 'star trails'. The Lissajous array is interpolated with Perlin noise array to make it less smooth and looks more random.\n\n\n\n----------\nControl:\nPress [s] to capture a screenshot of the current viewport.\nPress [t] to toggle the star trails (default: enabled).\n\n\n\nMade with Cables.gl\n\nXALTED 2022\n",

Each artwork in this series is a testament to the elegance of algorithmic design, where curves are drawn and then echoed with slight variations in color and spacing. This method produces a rich tapestry of intersecting and parallel lines, forming intricate patterns that invite the viewer to explore the complexity within simplicity.\nThe interplay of these lines results in a dynamic dance of density and openness, where some areas burst with vibrant, overlapping curves while others breathe with serene, empty spaces. The varying angles and repeated motifs create a sense of movement and rhythm, evoking the sensation of a symphony playing out on the canvas.\nBy blending technology with artistic intuition, Curved Symphony transcends traditional boundaries, offering a unique fusion of precision and creativity. This collection invites you to lose yourself in the harmonious flow of curves, discovering new perspectives and emotions with each viewing. It’s a celebration of form, color, and the limitless possibilities that emerge when art and algorithms intertwine.\n\nS = Save\nMade by p5.js",

In a space where endless time and rivers flow, without beginning and without end, always flowing and at the same moment, not recorded and not forgotten. In the period when the earth speaks of itself with a call of love and passion in every moment of life. When the heart sinks into the past, each emotion has its people. Here, feelings, thoughts, and ideas shine in an endless beam of time, each drop of which has a deep immersion in the vast sea of the past and experiences. A place where borders are erased and people connect with the earth. That bright spot in time and place reminds us that we are all part of a bigger story. Events that are connected from beginning to end are always ongoing and have eternity and beauty. From thousands of years ago until today, nature has shown endless displays of its special beauty. I want to talk about its sedimentary textures and its various colors, signs of an infinite path of time, and natural changes that have affected it, and each piece of it tells a mysterious story of its journey through time; From its formation in the depths of the seas and rivers to the emergence on the surface of the earth. A natural miracle, which, with its beauty, draws us to a world of greatness and wonder. Grooves that scream from the depths of time remind us that everything in this world is an infinite and beautiful journey, and we are part of this great world.\nPerhaps it is a symbol of beauty and stability in the stone world. Wonders that tell us about the distant past. It begins when the universe began to form and continues to this day. This geological formation, which was formed millions of years ago, is a masterpiece of earth maps that takes us to distant, complicated, and adventurous times. Textures of sedimentary rocks that preserve their beauty and special patterns tell a story of the journey of nature's superpower. Thin layers of blue, green, and red stones, make a valuable past for us; From water currents, solar eclipses, and deep underground fun.\nAnd finally, I conclude that the earth is an infinite museum of beauty and history. Each layer of this formation tells us a new chapter of the greatness of the world. A story that continues to this day and always fascinates us by watching his works.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

I discussed it with a friend and we decided to do it together.\nWe bought the stones, took them to the garden, and started paving clumsily.\nWhen we had only done a small amount of it, I was very frustrated and tired.\nI went inside the building to see the paving from the top floor.\nI was amazed by what I saw. A full-fledged artwork!\nMaybe we didn't follow the rules and principles of paving, but when we looked at the result from above, everything was in its proper place.\nNow, every time I step on this pavement, I tell myself, don't forget to look from above!\nThat trouble and helplessness turned into pleasure and peace for me with just one look from above.\nMaybe this is the main point of life. Looking at the issues from above.\nThis collection is inspired by this simple story, but it was a valuable achievement for me.\nI hope the audience of this work will enjoy looking at things from above.\n\nS = Save\nMade by p5.js",

            "description": "The idea of designing an urban facade came to my mind in 2019, but it was postponed for various reasons. A few months ago I refocused on this project and after reviewing the available examples I decided to use a specific style to implement it.\nThis algorithm depicts an isometric view of a city. Therefore, the basis of this algorithm is isometric design.\nIsometric drawing comes from the Greek \"iso metro,\" meaning equal measure. This is because the angle between the x, y, and z axes is 120°. It's a form of axonometric perspective (there is no foreshortening). In other words, face lines are all drawn from the same angle.\nThe advantage of drawing this way is that an object can be freely rotated, re-positioned, and reoriented without redrawing it. There is also no change in scale when an object is moved forward or backward.\nOne of the features of using this style is that with a suitable combination of colors at different angles, you can quickly achieve 3D output with a 2D design.\nEach building is individually designed after determining its height with a random algorithm, then one of dozens of random roof design algorithms is called for finalization.\nTwo types of scale combinations have been used for building scale, one is buildings with the same scale. In this combination, large-scale structures are formed when buildings are placed next to each other. And in other compositions, the integration of different scales creates more depth and variety.\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

They published a paper about the underlying algorithm, found at: http://www.edwardzajec.com/tvc4/pil1/index.html\n\nTVC was first printed in 1971, shortly after Zajec returned to Italy following his artistic studies in the US.

            "description": "Kyma (/kee-ma/, κύμα) is a Greek word meaning wave. It is my exploration of an acoustic phenomenon known as ‘Chladni Patterns’. \n\nErnst Florens Friedrich Chladni was a German physicist and musician. He was a pioneer of modern acoustics and made numerous contributions to the field. Chladni's work had a significant influence on the development of modern music theory and the technology of musical instruments. In 1787, Chladni was trying to understand how sound waves propagate and interact with objects. By vibrating a metal plate and sprinkling sand on it, he observed that the sand arranged itself into distinct patterns. These patterns are created due to the interaction between the sound waves and the plate: the sound waves cause the plate to vibrate, which in turn causes the sand to move. The sand will move away from areas of high vibration and towards areas of low vibration. This creates a unique pattern of ridges, circles, and many other shapes.\n\nKyma continues this study by adding color, light, and composition to the equation. Each iteration is a unique combination of two Chladni plates with different characteristics, accompanied by a palette, background lighting, and variational drawing algorithm. Plates interact with each other, forming patterns from the small detailed net-like grid to megalithic sculptures of unknown creatures and windows to another worlds.\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.\n\nRendering can be computationally heavy, please be patient and give it some time to draw.\nChrome is highly recommended for live mode and high res saving.\n\nMade with love, math, and p5js. \n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG 2400 x 1600\n[2] - save PNG 4800 x 3200\n[3] - save PNG 9600 x 6400\n[4] - save PNG 14400 x 9600",

They are portals opening our view to rich content.\n\nThis work is a portal to itself. It loads itself within itself 20 times. It's not pretty, it reminds us of WordArt, it's a little bit hacky, it might break when our tools to display HTML will change. But it's a proof that the limits of our tools are only limits until creativity breaks them.\n\nThis work is not purely deterministic, because it simply cannot be. Slight timing differences due to loading times being different each time an <iframe> is loaded will make each visualization slightly unique.\n\nIf you view this token on mobile, the nesting limit was reduced to 4 to prevent performance issues.\n\nThis work is highly experimental. It leverages a \"hack\" to allow iframes to be nested.\nFirefox max <iframe> nesting depth as of 28/12/2021 is capped at 9.\nWorks with chrome desktop 96.0.4664.110",

Franke, a pioneer of computer art, passed away on July 16, 2022 at the age of 95. CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE is an homage to Franke’s MONDRIAN software developed for the Texas Instruments TI 99/4 home computer in 1979, and it’s a fundraiser to digitize his archive:\n\n“Our goal is to raise 20,000 Euro so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. If we raise more money, it will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.” \n\nEach frame, a single “pixel” is added to the CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE image. When the software first loads, 100,000 frames are run in the background to start things off. Keep it running for hours or days to see it transform entirely — it’s an “infinite animation.”",

            "description": "Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project. \n\nFile Size: 5100 x 6600\nPress ’s’ to save the image as a .jpg\nPress ‘p’ to save the images as a .png\n\n//= Tiller, 2024\n",

They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",
