We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "What Is Brutalism?\nBrutalism is a style of architecture that lasted from the 1950s-1970s, and it was characterized by simple, block-like, hulking concrete structures, with an emphasis on materials, textures and construction, producing highly expressive forms.\n\nThe buildings are characterised by their massive, monolithic and ‘blocky’ appearance with a rigid geometric style and large-scale use of poured concrete.\n\nBrutalism began to fade out in the 1980s, where it increasingly came to be regarded as cold, alienating and unfit for humans. It turned out that concrete had an allure of indestructibility but deteriorated from the inside, making it difficult to maintain and prone to crumbling and water damage as it aged.\n\nIn the years since, the world has been divided into those who think that Brutalist buildings are eyesores that should be demolished and those who find these vintage but not yet historic buildings architectural masterpieces to be cherished and preserved. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the work:\nThis work was built entirely with code using only math, logic and 2D shapes to create light, shadow and perspective.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nFeatures:\n\"Canvas Orientation\": Square, Portrait\n\"Building Size\": Large, Medium, Small\n\"Time of day\": Day, Night\n\"Sun/Moon\": True, False\n\"Palette\": 23 palettes\n\"Floors\": 3, 4\n\"Clouds\": True, False\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nConstrols in live mode:\nOn desktop: Press 's' or 'S' to save as PNG (2622x3720 or 3720x3720)\nOn mobile: Touch the screen to save as PNG (2622x3720 or 3720x3720)\n\nArtwork created with p5.js and love.\nNovember-December 2022",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

            "description": "Let me take you places. Those are not in your town, not even on your planet. They’re placed somewhere between reality and subconsciousness.\nEnormous, peculiar structures emerge upon you, refusing to be ignored. They are your unfulfilled cravings or ever-lurking demons. They were always there, under your skin, intangible, now they’ve materialized.\nYou may not like them, they may seem too vast, too scary to tame. But ultimately, you have to face them, unless you enjoy living in their shadow. \n\n___\nInspirations\n\nI’ve never truly realized that, but ever since I remember, the sight of gigantic objects or creatures evoked strong emotions within me.\nIt probably started with playing Shadow of Colossus (a video game) as a kid and seeing The Cathedral (short movie by Tomasz Bagiński). Years later, reading Solaris (by Stanisław Lem) aroused the same feeling (among others) of being mesmerized by the vastness. More recently, movies like Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival (which also nudged my attraction to mystery) and Dune - have charmed me.\n\nEarlier this year I have stumbled across Dawid Planeta (artist and yoga teacher) and began contemplating his visions of mini people in the jungle inhabited by giant animals. These works in particular, plus Hollow - generative series by Jacek Markusiewicz - were probably my final inspirations to make Intangible look the way it does.\n\nSettling semi-random generative structures in some kind of reality, gave them a meaning - they may symbolize things much bigger than you - the ones you try to escape from or those you’ve been longing to experience for years. I have mine, don’t you?\n\n___\nControls in live mode\n\n\nKeyboard\n[ space ] - toggle light animation\n[ S ] - save image with current size (default is 120% of browser window’s height; you may change browser’s scale or check URL size param)\n[ F ] - fullscreen \n[ up / down ] - light intensity\n[ left / right ] - base light position\n[ 1..5 ] - aspect ratio: 10:16 („zero” ratio), 1:1.4142 (vertical A4), 1:1, 1.4142 (horizontal A4), 16:10\n[ B ] - toggle border\n[ Z ] - toggle canvas „raw” mode - no shadow / margin (auto applied in fullscreen mode)\n[ N ] - toggle „that thing you may not want on print”\n\n\nURL params\nYou may add any number of parameters to the URL to start it with particular settings. \n[ animate ] (1/0) - toggle light animation\n[ size] (number) - number of px for longer edge, i.e. 4000\n[ ratio ] (number or ratio with format: 10/16, 10:16, 10_16) - aspect ratio\n[ light ] (number 40..120, some palettes have slightly different limits for good results) - light intensity\n[ lightShift] (number -100..100) - base light position\n[ border ] (1/0) - toggle border\n[ hddcy ] (0/1)\n\nExample: [ &size=4000&border=1&light=100&animate=1 ] \n\n\nMobile\n[hold 2 fingers for 2s] - save\n[double tap] - fullscreen\n\n\n___\nNote:\nI encourage you to do some light adjustments before you save an image for print. I’m pretty sure you can do better than fxrand().\n\n\n___\nSpecial thanks to my brother Krzycho, for lots of advices / heathy criticism and to Olga, for never-ending excitement and „dorady”.\n\n___\nDeveloped in Javascript, using p5.js (2D Canvas) and chroma.js.\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n© April-July 2022, MadeUpLifeforms (mulf)\n",

According to the Law of Conservation of Matter, the total amount of matter in a closed system stays constant over time, only changing its form. Some living creatures have been luckier than others, as we can still find remnants of organisms from millions of years ago, serving as silent witnesses to mankind’s flourishing.\n\nYet, the human race is exploiting the planet at an unprecedented pace. We are depleting its resources, polluting its atmosphere, producing hazardous materials, disrupting the natural balance of all things. We are causing harm while still expecting the earth to nurture and delight us. We’re just a small dot on the timeline, and yet so much damage has been done.\n\nThrough this project, I humbly attempt to create imitations of fossils and other forms of natural matter. These made up forms may appear attractive, reminding us of nature, but what emotion would they evoke in a natureless world, built of concrete, iron, and plastic?\n\nWhat do we leave behind?\n\n\n___\n20% of the primary sales go directly to One Earth, non-profit organization working to counteract the climate crisis in multiple, innovative ways.\n\n___\nTechnical notes:\n\n- By default, an output image size is based on your browser size (x1.25, with a maximum of 1800) - The script is quite heavy, so it may take some time on higher resolutions (but it’s worth it)\n\nDesktop controls:\n- To change the output resolution, use [1..6] on your keyboard (1250..7200px, roughly A5..A0 print sizes on 300dpi) or [0] to restore the default \n- Press [S] to save the current image\n- Press [F] to switch fullscreen mode\n\nMobile controls:\n- Hold two fingers for 2s to save\n- Tap twice to switch fullscreen mode\n\nURL params\n- Add `&density=[number]` (0.5..1) to change calculated field’s density (default is 0.65)\n- Add `&size=[number]` (1..6) to render with desired resolution \n- Add `&save=1` to save image when ready\n\n___\nDeveloped in Javascript, using p5.js (2D Canvas) and chroma.js.\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n© February 2023, MadeUpLifeforms (mulf)\n",

            "description": "\"In the year of 3023 the planet Earth from which all humans descend, today is called 'EARTH01', it is so called because it was the first planet to be completely destroyed by humanity. During the last few years of this planet's existence, the human race used all its resources to find new habitable planets and ways to reach them.\n\nAfter long years of tireless research, they began to discover new places where they could survive and explore, and thus they migrated from planet to planet and formed human colonies for thousands of years. Then one day some of them arrived on a new planet to begin their colonization, in this place they found trees very similar to the ones they knew, through ancient records of their ancestors, to have existed on EARTH01.\n\nBut unlike the trees on EARTH01, these were gigantic and instead of just fruit, some species also produced many types of important resources for human survival, such as water (extracted from some types of fruit), and even precious ores similar to of your home planet. To grow and survive, trees needed nothing more than a specific light from that solar system, which was very plentiful on that planet. These trees were then named 'Bellatrix', which in Latin (an almost lost language of EARTH01) meant 'warrior'.\n\nWith this discovery they thought had in their hands an infinite power, and so they began the same cycle done on all other planets, sucking all possible resources without thinking about the possibility of them having an end.\nAfter a few hundred years the planet began to crumble due to exploitation, and all the chaos caused by humans due to their greed and selfishness turned against them. Few Bellatrixes were left alive, the few existing rivers on the planet dried up, the woods and forests before full of life and those wonderful trees, no longer existed...\n\nSociety was in decline, laws no longer had effect on this civilization, there were groups of marauders, living there was no longer something safe. That planet full of life was now a desert planet, surrounded by sand dunes that swallowed the ruins of ancient buildings.\nIt was then that people realized that the same mistake had been made for all these thousands of years, generation after generation, no matter how fertile the new planet was, humanity always managed to deplete it and its resources. But it was too late, this civilization no longer had enough resources for them to leave this planet.\n\nWith that, a movement began for the preservation of these trees and the creation of complexes where people and Bellatrixes could live in safety, away from looters and other dangers now common in this place. The complexes were formed by units, which were raised many meters high to hinder the action of invaders, they were like small and large cities, but now far from the ground. These units were supported by small central columns, the more units and Bellatrixes in the complex, the more powerful and populous it was.\n\nAnd that's how they lived for many years, in these complexes there were rules and each one had their own specific ones, and they worked autonomously. Utilizing the resources obtained through the Bellatrixes and finally understanding their importance, they were able to keep the population alive and continue their civilization.\"\n\nThis is a record found in the diary of an unidentified space traveler and the only existing record of civilization on this planet.\n\n------------------------------------\nAbout the work:\nThis work was built entirely with code using only math, logic and 2D shapes to create light, shadow and perspective.\n\n------------------------------------\nFeatures:\n\"Palette\": 23 Palettes\n\"Units\": 1 > 45\n\"Bellatrixes\": 0 > 135\n\"Resource level\": Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High\n\"Population\": Very Small, Small, Medium, High, Very High\n\"Clouds\": True, False\n\"Sun/Moon\": Sun, Moon, False\n\n------------------------------------\nConstrols in live mode:\nOn desktop: Press 's' or 'S' to save as PNG (2534x3596)\nOn mobile: Touch the screen to save as PNG (2534x3596)\n\nArtwork created with p5.js and love.\nFebruary-March 2023",

There are 17 figures that get combined and mixed over three layers. The figures vary in complexity but are generally created with vertical and horizontal lines only. Figures have at least one seed, some even have a seed per path. A seed is an oscillating pixel that can be compared to a square wave oscillator of audio synthesis and is usually followed by a path or a set of paths. The purpose of the paths is to send the pixels along the lines to make the figures visible through movement and to create a reduction to pure animation.\n\n👽 Kim Asendorf",

            "description": "Komšije,' a word meaning 'neighbors' in Serbian, is an art piece that intertwines architectural elements with the Golden Ratio (1:1.618). Inspired by the brutalist architecture of New Belgrade, Serbia, and my love for minimalism and modernism, this work explores the possibilities of this combination generatively.\n\nThe buildings of New Belgrade, a significant inspiration for this piece, exhibit a unique character. Despite their aesthetic, which may have fallen out of popular style, these structures are exceptionally solid and well-designed, having withstood the test of time. More than mere apartment blocks, they represent vertical ecosystems. Within their stark and imposing concrete forms exist a multitude of private worlds, each suspended in a communal yet distinct space, embodying the essence of interconnectedness and resilience.\n\nThe Golden Ratio, a recurring element in my creations, is a proportion frequently found in nature. It is visible in sea shell spirals and human body proportions, offering an aesthetically pleasing and comforting familiarity.\n\nIn 'Komšije,' this ratio arranges mostly residential architectural forms in elevation view, blending Mid-Century modernism, Japanese post-modernism, and Eastern European brutalism. The compositions are created by repeatedly dividing the width and height of each piece by the Golden Ratio, ensuring every element is proportionally related to the whole. This method aligns column widths and floor heights, maintaining a cohesive structure.\n\nThe artwork strikes a balance between formal architectural diagrams and hand-drawn sketches. It features generative imperfections that mimic my sketching style, fostering a sense of openness and possibility missing from formal or detailed diagrams and renders. Although the structures depicted may not be architecturally practical, they are designed to evoke a sense of wonder and joy through their playful geometry and massing.\n\n—————\n\nTENDER x Studio Yorktown\nDecember 2023\n\n'Komšije’ is Serbian for ‘neighbors’, and is a generative art series created by Studio Yorktown in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n—————\n\nKey Commands : \n\nPress ‘S’ to save a high-resolution output of your structure.",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\nAll That Could Be is about the inner life of pitch drops waiting for their inevitable fall.\n\nAfter first learning of the pitch drop experiment and understanding what this odd hyper-viscous liquid was… all I could think about was: How does the pitch feel about all of this? What does it dream of? How does it deal with this intense pressure to snap, drip and perform?\n\nAll That Could Be acts as a metaphysical microscope into the emotional state of the pitch. The anticipated explosion of energy and pain when it loses its battle with gravity… as well as daydreams imagined to brighten its dark, slow existence with vibrant, static-y layers… or fantasies of being anywhere else besides trapped in a funnel under a locked encasement for the entertainment/curiosity of others who just hope to see you snap into two.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://hereandnow.events/\n\nProcure a coin to participate in the event:\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/here-and-now:-edition-5\n\n————\n\nSome key commands in live mode:\n\nG : Toggle grain\nA : Toggle aura\nS : Save current resolution\n1 : 3000x3750\n2 : 4500x5625\n3 : 6000x7500\n4 : 7500x9375\n5 : 9000x11250\n6 : 10500x13125\n(1-6 work best on Chrome/Edge)\n(rendering takes longer as resolution increases)",
