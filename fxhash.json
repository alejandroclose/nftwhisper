The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature. Brought into existence via the blockchain, it is a new form of “token word poetry.”\n\n\nAs with the duo’s other poetry “unreadings,” all minters will receive an airdropped broadside of the full poem after all editions are collected. A 1/1 media-rich version of the entire poem will also be made available. \n \nPoetic traits:\n- 321 editions performed by the algorithm, out of billions of possible combinations\n- Each unique piece contains between 3 and 6 (out of 60) lines of generative text from a poem by Technelegy – a custom text generator fine-tuned on Stiles’ writing and research material, seeded with prompts from Stiles’ and Stern’s work – translated into binary and performed by Stiles\n- 24 possible binary backbeats performed by Stern in his “Nathaniel Fun Time” (NFT) stylings, and generatively re-mixed\n- 98 possible intros\n- 15 musical stems composed by Kris Bones, generating millions of possible mixes\n- Thousands of possible ending combinations \n- 5 fonts, layered in billions of potential ways, including Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer”\n- 13 color palettes based on Stern and Stiles’ respective artworka\n- Very rare attributes including music-less performance, poem-less music, repeated “B1nary 0de” (title only)\n\nClick to start and stop or replay. Although the first play through will be the same every time, starting and stopping may create minor variations in your mix (though not any of the core attributes).\n\n0RAL B1NARY: “BINARY ODE” was produced with partial support from Refraction DAO’s Creative Grants program, and premiered as part of Refraction Festival at Art Basel Miami 2022. 15% of primary sales go to Refraction, and 5% of primary sales will be donated to Black Girls Code.\n",

It starts with a collection of analog photographs, shot on film and scanned that were later used as a training dataset in Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training. This way, A.I. learns the main characteristics of film photography. In particular, it mimics its recognizable grain. Another type of pixel grain is added with the use of code and pixel shifting as well as digital manipulation. Finally, the last type of “grain” appears with the use of generative text where a different kind of A.I. was given a short description of the project and instructed to imagine the rest of the story. The fragmented and void of meaning parts of generative text are added to the images as one of the possible traits.",

            "description": "Illustrations from The Collection of Most Beautiful Fairy Tales I had and puzzles with a painting by Ivan Rabuzin owned by one of my friends are deeply embedded in my childhood memory as images I was enchanted by and wished I knew how to make. Recently, searching for both items in antique stores, it turned out the illustrations, although still beautiful, aren't the same as I remember them. Rabuzin's oeuvre is rich and is a direct inspiration for this project, but I failed to find any evidence those puzzles ever existed and possibly are the product of my imagination. \n\nThe same case is with fairy tales and their true and \"untrue\" nature. A hero embarks on a journey where various events unfold in seemingly random or loosely connected ways. The occurrences sometimes lead to improbable plot twists, but these enigmatic transformations ultimately bring the story full circle, evoking a sense of familiarity combined with an air of mystery.\n\nOn this Enchanted journey, you might end up in one of five possible scenes: Fairy Lake, Magic Wetlands, Giant's Woods, Over 7 Seas and 7 Mountains, or Enchanted Forest. Look out for the FOMO keyboard key to visit more locations.\n\nUse [s] key in live view to save output as PNG. \n\n----\nEnchanted was part of the Blind Gallery x Feral File Vistas Edition.\nLearn more at https://www.blindgallery.xyz/ ",

I have been using Precisions as a meditative art practice where I focus on exact positioning of elements, less-emphasized colors, and repetition of geometric shapes.  \n\nIn \"angles\", each element is comprised of right triangles transformed over a common point.  I decided to bring some of the fragmentation from my previous project, \"Restrictions\", to produce irregular works.  I found beauty in that unpredictable asymmetry and feel it really enhances the structure of this piece. ",

            "description": "Each monogrid artwork gets initialized with a start up algorithm that builds up a set of rectangles and fills them with pixels. There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",
