            "description": "\"Nature is the source of all true knowledge\".\n\nHave you ever taken the time to look, deeply look, at all the details in a humble patch of grass ?\n\nIn this tiny microcosm, a constant, fierce battle is going on, day after day, plants reaching out for sun, down for access to soil, fighting for survival. Smaller grasses form groups, alliances making it harder for taller ones to take over. Dead leaves remind us that some of them lost the fight, fallen warriors who, soon enough, will be forgotten too. Growth, decay, life, death, the endless cycle, right in front of our eyes.\n\nIt is fascinating, and, for me at least, an endless source of inspiration.\n\nIt is my hope that, through this project, you will take the time to take a closer look at nature, and that, as the pale blue dot we call home keeps getting drier and drier, remember that even humble patches of grass should not be taken for granted.\n\n\nKey commands:\n's' - save as png\n'b' - make the background transparent (for printing)\n'1', '2, '4' - set the pixel density, for resolutions up to 8000x8000\n\nThis updated version of the project should render on mobile devices, albeit with slightly reduced quality. \nIf you want to save the image for printing, I recommend you do so on desktop.\n",

            "description": "Vistas is an exploration in using layers to build an abstracted geometric landscape using a generative algorithm. But in a way that not only creates a digital image but also allows for the creation of an IRL physical artwork made from the 18 layers of laser cut wood. \n\nAll mints created in first day will receive a free physical woodcut valued at ~$250. Up to 10% of all other mints may randomly get a free physical as well. \n\nLearn more about physicals: https://alleditions.art/p/vistas\n\nThe canvas for each output may be one of three different orientations, a square, portrait, or landscape. The portrait and landscape orientations create physicals that are 7.5 x 11.5 inches and square orientations create 7.5 x 7.5 inch physicals. \n\nThe resulting output is carefully designed so that it can be exploded into discreet layers (Shift-E) and exported as an SVG (Shift-S) so it can be used to laser cut or plot an IRL physical artwork. \n\nA variety of elements are used to construct each unique one of a kind landscape. Sun, moon, sunbeams, stars, clouds, mountains, hills, plains, beaches, fields, water, boats, rocks, trees, and even mysterious obelisks. \n\n\n\nUTILITY\n\nShift - P to export a PNG\nShift - E explode the layers\nShift - S export a vector SVG\n\nSlide the layers with the arrow keys. Click and drag the mouse to move the light source and adjust the layer shadows.\n\nQUERY STRINGS\n\nAdd &screws=true to render with screw holes for cutting in order to assemble a physical with chicago screws.\n\nAdjust the size of the output by adding &x=1150 and/or &y=1150 to adjust the physical size of the output where 100 = 1 inch.",

            "description": "Take your entire life, full as it is with the vastness of your lived experiences – and shape it into your cupped hands. Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",

Or, you may not see anything. Instead, you can just enjoy things falling into place.\n\nGet a pack of shattered glass, snow, or ice*, uncovering a pattern. Or an axis of dancing geometries. Enter the Garden of Symmetry.\n\nThe graphic is a plottable SVG file in A3 format, ready to be drawn using a pen plotter. In the full screen view, click somewhere on the artwork to download a copy.\n\nI recommend to optimize the SVG before plotting, i.e. using vpype.
