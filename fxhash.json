It may take several seconds to produce a recognizable image, and several minutes to produce a high-quality render with no visible noise.\n\nCreated with webgl and clojurescript.\n\nControls:\n\nClick on the canvas to open a menu in the top right corner. In this menu you will see controls to capture a screenshot, adjust resolution, and adjust the camera, along with several other controls.\n\nWhen the \"optimized render\" option is checked, the page will compute an acceleration structure before rendering to allow the piece to converge much faster. With this option checked, the piece may need to process for up to a minute before rendering begins, but subsequently the rendering will proceed much more quickly than normal. This can be used to generate high-quality captures more quickly than when the option is not checked.\n\nWhen the \"filtering\" option is checked, a noise filter will be applied to the result of the render, reducing the appearance of noise.\n\nThe \"logic multiple\" slider can be used to multiply the amount of rendering work done each frame. Increasing this number may allow the piece to render more quickly, but may also make the page laggy. It is not recommended to increase this number unless you have a powerful GPU.",

            "description": "Rulette (Rule+Roulette) is a generative artwork showcasing the wildly varied complex patterns that arise from the simple deterministic rule system of an outer-totalistic cellular automaton (CA), starting from a simple initial state where several non-zero cells -- which act as nucleation sites for pattern growth -- are positioned around a circle. The first twenty five steps of the CA evolution are shown sequentially in a grid, with the center cell update rules for each of the eighteen 9-neighbor configurations shown at the top. \n\nThis project is meant to invoke the spirit of discovery and fascination I experienced at the Wolfram (NKS) Summer School and the late nights of coding to \"explore the computational universe\" with fellow instructors and students. It was my gateway into generative art.\n------------------------------------\nTips on minting with params:  Although I have filtered out rules that lead to 'trivial' behavior (i.e. evolving to static or homogenous states of 0s or 1s), there are still over 100K rules to explore. Pull up the params page and randomly shuffle through the rules (the 'Roulette' in the name). As you do this dozens of times, your reflex pattern detection and novelty seeking will become engaged and some rules will really jump out at you. Hit the save button, since you will likely never see the same rule again otherwise. Before you mint, be sure to hit the hash refresh button at the top, which will shuffle through different initial configurations.\n------------------------------------\nParameters / features (controllable by the minter)\n* Display theme: Light or Dark\n* CA Rule Index: index into the filtered set of rules -- I have filtered out rules that lead to trivial behavior, and thus have a reduced array of allowed rules. NOTE: this is not the actual rule number (it is given as a feature, see below).\n------------------------------------\nAdditional features\n* Nucleation sites: this is the number of non-zero cells in the initial state, which are distributed evenly (with some random jitter) around a circle. Has values between 2 and 8.\n* CA Rule Number: this is the rule number using the Wolfram rule numbering system. (Note: the Game of Life is an outer-totalistic 9-neighbor CA, and is rule 224, however it has been excluded in this work since that rule does not support the very sparse initial state used here).\n* CA Rule Binary:  this is the binary representation of the rule number -- it encodes the center cell update rule for each of the 18 neighborhood configurations, which is depicted visually at the top of the page.\n------------------------------------\nInteractivity\nManga mode: press 'm' (desktop) to toggle between left-to-right vs right-to-left sequential reading order.\nPress 's' (desktop) or tap (mobile) to save a high-res PNG (3000x3000).\nPress 'v' (desktop) to save an SVG file.\n------------------------------------\nBuilt using p5.js. Also uses the p5.js-svg library.\nCreated in May 2023 by @jamieinfinity (Jamie Williams).",

            "description": "Rulette (Rule+Roulette) is a generative artwork showcasing the wildly varied complex patterns that arise from the simple deterministic rule system of an outer-totalistic cellular automaton (CA), starting from a simple initial state where several non-zero cells -- which act as nucleation sites for pattern growth -- are positioned around a circle. The first twenty five steps of the CA evolution are shown sequentially in a grid, with the center cell update rules for each of the eighteen 9-neighbor configurations shown at the top. \n\nThis project is meant to invoke the spirit of discovery and fascination I experienced at the Wolfram (NKS) Summer School and the late nights of coding to \"explore the computational universe\" with fellow instructors and students. It was my gateway into generative art.\n------------------------------------\nTips on minting with params:  Although I have filtered out rules that lead to 'trivial' behavior (i.e. evolving to static or homogenous states of 0s or 1s), there are still over 100K rules to explore. Pull up the params page and randomly shuffle through the rules (the 'Roulette' in the name). As you do this dozens of times, your reflex pattern detection and novelty seeking will become engaged and some rules will really jump out at you. Hit the save button, since you will likely never see the same rule again otherwise. Before you mint, be sure to hit the hash refresh button at the top, which will shuffle through different initial configurations.\n------------------------------------\nParameters / features (controllable by the minter)\n* Display theme: Light or Dark\n* CA Rule Index: index into the filtered set of rules -- I have filtered out rules that lead to trivial behavior, and thus have a reduced array of allowed rules. NOTE: this is not the actual rule number (it is given as a feature, see below).\n------------------------------------\nAdditional features\n* Nucleation sites: this is the number of non-zero cells in the initial state, which are distributed evenly (with some random jitter) around a circle. Has values between 2 and 8.\n* CA Rule Number: this is the rule number using the Wolfram rule numbering system. (Note: the Game of Life is an outer-totalistic 9-neighbor CA, and is rule 224, however it has been excluded in this work since that rule does not support the very sparse initial state used here).\n* CA Rule Binary:  this is the binary representation of the rule number -- it encodes the center cell update rule for each of the 18 neighborhood configurations, which is depicted visually at the top of the page.\n------------------------------------\nInteractivity\nManga mode: press 'm' (desktop) to toggle between left-to-right vs right-to-left sequential reading order.\nPress 's' (desktop) or tap (mobile) to save a high-res PNG (3000x3000).\nPress 'v' (desktop) to save an SVG file.\n------------------------------------\nBuilt using p5.js. Also uses the p5.js-svg library.\nCreated in May 2023 by @jamieinfinity (Jamie Williams).",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "Sol is a companion project that complements my recent series, Metamorphosis. Both projects share a common foundation - a cellular automata engine. The state of each cell in a new generation is influenced by its own state as well as those of its neighboring cells from the last generation. The rules guiding these state transitions, however, are dynamic.\n\nSol for me is an experimental plotter project. As a gesture of my gratitude to minters of Metamorphosis, all minters will be on the reserve list for a free piece of Sol. I’ll take a snapshot of Metamorphosis for the reserve list 30 minutes prior to Sol’s launch. For three days (unless all reserve-holders mint sooner), Sol will be only for those on the reserve list and I'll add anyone who purchases Metamorphosis on primary subsequently. After this period, any remaining pieces, along with an additional 50 mints, will be available for public sale.\n\nA Note on the Name: The inspiration behind the name 'Sol' springs from my visits to SF MoMA, where I always find myself in the space dedicated to Sol LeWitt. Through the repetition and variation of a singular concept, LeWitt constructed forms that were striking, often evolving from basic geometric forms into intricate structures. The same is also echoed in the principle of emergence in cellular automata, where complex systems arise from the interactions of simple components governed by rules. This series, Sol, is a homage to LeWitt's ingenuity in favoring dispassionate geometric forms over the emotionally-infused abstract art styles.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete svg file for plotting. To download three separate svg files with individual colors for plotting press 1,2 & 3. Running an optimization tool can help decrease the plotting time.\n\nPixel Love!\n",

This figurative artwork is entirely generated through code, employing simple strokes and circular arcs. It may exhibit various inks, papers, and shapes.\n\nTo redeem the NFT, simply send an email directly to greweb@protonmail.com to request a physical plot from @greweb. The NFT serves as the key to obtaining a physically plottable art piece. It exports an SVG file that can be used for plotting with pens. Plotter artists have the freedom to utilize their own materials and ship the completed artwork to collectors, provided they possess the NFT at the time of the request. To obtain the .SVG file, simply drag and drop it into a folder or right-click and save.\n\nFor those interested in the technical details, this work was created using WebGL + Rust + WASM and is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.

It starts with triangles and lines and results in a diverse array of formations.\n\nIn 'Apertum', you will find a series of transformations and reshuffles, as well as a vibrant mix of textures and patterns. These interactions give rise to intricate compositions that I hope you'll enjoy discovering.\n\n'Apertum' is both a thank you to those who have supported my work so far and an invitation to those new to my creations. I invite you to step into the world of 'Apertum', to discover its interplay of shapes, colors, and textures.\n\nPress [s] to save a .png file of the artwork. Made with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023",

            "description": "Each NFT is a recipe to a physical postcard format (A6 size) and utilizes the Redeemables feature of fxhash, allowing owners to unlock a physical plot directly from the artist @greweb. This figurative artwork is entirely generated through code, employing simple strokes and circular arcs. It may exhibit various inks, papers, and shapes.\n\nTo redeem the NFT, simply send an email directly to greweb@protonmail.com to request a physical plot from @greweb. The NFT serves as the key to obtaining a physically plottable art piece. It exports an SVG file that can be used for plotting with pens. Plotter artists have the freedom to utilize their own materials and ship the completed artwork to collectors, provided they possess the NFT at the time of the request. To obtain the .SVG file, simply drag and drop it into a folder or right-click and save.\n\nFor those interested in the technical details, this work was created using WebGL + Rust + WASM and is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0.

            "description": "\"Landscape painting is the contemplation of the earth's features made visible to us in their most perfect moments. It is the record of nature's beauty, which often appears like a momentary revelation; and its effect is to show us how much beauty is around us that we never attend to, and by whose presence we are cheered and elevated in unobserved and unsuspected hours of depression or anxiety.”\nJohn Ruskin\n\n In this collection, I aimed to design the essence of my utopia. Instead of my usual interactive and animated designs, I created a drawing that gives the impression of lithographic printing on 2D black paper, where textures remain static. I wanted the nature objects to have a slightly dark, somewhat Fauvist style. I sought a balance between their depressive nature and the hopeful tranquility of natural light sources, which evoked the feeling I was searching for.\n\n*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as png.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.\n\n“Stratification of the Orthogonal”\n“Agora of Timeless”\n“Surely, There is an Exit”\n\nEveryone who owns the above collections is entitled to a free mint right in this collection.
