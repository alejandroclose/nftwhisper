            "description": "Toccata is a piece about decay, about the impermanent. The emergence over time or, rather, progression of entropy is a key characteristic of our universe. Everything evolves to nothing. We as mortal beings have sometimes trouble reconciling with this idea. Humans have sought immortality for millennia, be it through ancient potions or modern medicine, be it from leaving a legacy that we feel will stand the test of time. It will, only to decay later than us.\n\nToccata is a piece about change. Change lies at the heart of human cognition and human nature. Our thoughts and our emotions happen over time, and are a function of the change that is both around us and at the very core of our selves. Change comes in nature in cycles. Seasons of growth, seasons of ripe fruits of life, seasons of decay, of death, rebirth.\n\nToccata is music. We find music to convey some of the deepest streams of human condition, connecting it to some other form of being. Music also happens over time, and music happens because of change. Music encodes our feelings better than any other aid we may have. Toccata incorporates this at its very core, as the main sound is Andreas' family piano where he learned to play, sampled this past July.\n\nRead more about the piece, and the collaboration between Marcelo and Andreas on andreasrau.eu/toccata\n\n---\n\nBasic controls:\n- Click on the piece or press spacebar to start it (WebAudio requires user intervention for the music to start). Once the music has started, again click or press spacebar to play/pause.\n- Press “s” to save a still at the current resolution\n- Press “r” to start recording a video at the current resolution, then “r” again to stop.\n\n---\n\nWebM audio-video recording performed using the library RecordRTC by https://muazkhan.com/, MIT licence.",

Many of the problems we observe today are consequences of societies adhering to binary oppositions even when they no longer make sense.

We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it. Thank you very much for collecting and for your continuous support.\n\n10% of primary and secondary sales will go to fxhash team; thank you for what you are doing.\n\nSelf reserved pieces are for promised gifts to my collectors.\n\nPress S to save as PNG.

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "===== A Simple Fail =====\n\nAn attempt to release a quick follow-up to Adherence following simple rules and a concise set of features has utterly failed!  I ended up spending 9 months of development on this \"quick\" project; I didn't even spend that much time on Adherence.  What happened?  First, and foremost, I had no intention to ever release a project that I wouldn't be absolutely excited about if I were to see in the Incoming feed as a collector.  Nothing wrong with that, right!?  But, not all factors that delayed this project were so noble.  I have to admit that as I continued to stack features and techniques, my codebase, once again, has gotten away from me.  I'm not too worried about how poor my code will look to lurkers (although, God help them!).  But, poor code, without question, hampers the ability for a developer to iterate.  Each shortcut a developer takes lays traps along paths that will eventually be revisited and I took A LOT of shortcuts in my excitement of each new idea.\n\nAppropriately, my failures are fully in keeping with the project itself.  A Simple Fail explores a favorite generative theme of human imperfection through the construction of each mints foundational grid to the \"inaccuracy\" of draw styles that fill each shape.  \n\n<Read more about A Simple Fail:\n@ https://www.bfos.art/projects/a-simple-fail \n@ https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/a-simple-fail>\n\n\n==== fx(params) Info ====\n\nWARNING: 1-Day Grace Period!\n\nThere is only a 24 hour grace period before mint tickets will need to be protected with the params tax.  Why?  Because there is currently no way to trade mint tickets during the grace period.  If you don't mint your ticket immediately, I STRONGLY suggest that you immediately update the price and tax coverage on your mint ticket.  This should only matter in the fortuitous case of a sell out, but I wanted to make sure this was communicated clearly just in case!\n\nI had initially decided to not include params in this project at all.  I think params are great, but most projects released with params so far have suffered because of them, in my opinion.  Params often detract from the artist's efforts to craft the feature-probability space and tuning of the project.  I put a lot of effort into that in this project and I didn't want to see collectors struggle to replicate what I've already crafted.  That said, I loved the restrained way Tyler Boswell (@teaboswell) implemented params in Reunion to give collectors a limited ability to choose their mints.  I thought 25 seeds per wallet was a little on the light side.  So, I have doubled that to 50 potential mints a wallet can choose from.  I have also configured an option to mint a completely random mint in the traditional style.  The features in your mint might include a complementary tip of the hat to your faithfulness for being so bold!  This option is selected by default.\n\n\n===== Interactions =====\n\n{A}dapt to device screen size (twice to rotate, thrice to original)\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{P}erfect grid switch\n{Z}oom switch\n{1-8} Save at x multiple of screen size\n\n== Print Options ==\n{B}ackground switch\n{F}rame switch\n{G}rain switch\n{H}ighlight switch\n\n== URL Parameters (useful for adjusting and saving on mobile devices) ==\n(Start your group of parameters by appending \"&\" to the end of your token URL following the fxparam parameters.
