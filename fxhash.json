Some extreme sounds (frequency and amplitude) can be generated.\n\n-Supply can be halved/reduced and/or the price can be doubled if all iterations have not been minted (every 24h aprox).\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n-An audiovisual piece based on randomly generated patterns. These patterns generate endless unique pieces of electronic music (and their corresponding visuals).\n\n-This is a 16-step sequencer based on 2 basic patterns: the kick drum and the tuplets of each kick.\n\n-In each cycle (from 16 to 64 kicks) there can be changes to many of the parameters of the patterns, thus generating changes to the piece in an infinite way.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n-\"tipusGrid\": type of grid-> (lines, rects, soroll (noise), ASCII, mosaic or barcode).\n-\"baseShape\": first cicle base shape (rect, circle,lines, vlines or hlines).\n-\"baseSize\": size of base shape.\n-\"gridDensity\": grid size (16, 32 or 64).\n-\"alpha\": alpha of base image.\n-\"alpha2\": alpha of canvas.\n-\"darkMode\": dark mode (true) or light mode (false).\n-\"color\": color of lines (dark mode) or background (light mode)-> white, red, green or blue.\n-\"bpm\": Beats Per Minute. from 90 to 160 -> this value is theoretical, some devices may not be able to play the piece at a certain speed.\n-\"tipusBass\": type of bass drum (from 0 to 5).\n-\"maxTuplet\": max number of tuplets for each kick.\n-\"reverb\": has reverb effect (audio)",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

The unnatural drawing order and chromatic differences of the individual faces sometimes yields illusory or paradoxical visual geometries.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png.

            "description": "Continuing on the theme of color perception in Farbteiler, Punktwelt is an exploration of color interaction, projection and perceived depth, and the aesthetics of simple Boolean operations on form.\n\nEach shape is the result of a single block, a rectangular cuboid, subjected to a series of Boolean subtractions with other blocks, and rendered in parallel projection, oblique or axonometric, in the abstract landscape of the Punktwelt.\n\nSome have horizons, some have banded or striped backgrounds. The unnatural drawing order and chromatic differences of the individual faces sometimes yields illusory or paradoxical visual geometries.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png. Press ’4’ to export a high resolution png. Press ’8’ to export a very high resolution png. Press ’e’ to export an SVG file (may take some time and produce large files).\n\nAspect ratio variations are 4:5, 5:4, 2:3, 3:2 and 1:1.\n\nBuilt in Javascript with p5.js, p5.svg and csg.js.",

Some iterations eventually stop, some continue indefinitely.\n\nThe fun is that the project is implemented on a fragment shader. There is no array of grains of sand. Each pixel decides whether a grain of sand from a neighboring pixel will end up in it or not. This logic required a lot of banging my head against the wall, because the slightest mistake caused sand to disappear into nowhere or appear out of nothing and clutter up the entire space.\n\n0…9 — set speed\nspace — pause\ns — save picture\ndrag over — add more sand\nshift+drag — erase",

As the artwork is drawn, it constantly recomposes itself during assembly with a series of displacement techniques, creating new forms and visual elements, while others get broken into pieces and textures. The work is orientation agnostic, and will display the output in portrait orientation on tall displays.\n\nIntended to display on high resolution mode. The artwork renders with lower resolution by default to maintain compatibility with lower end devices. \n\nPress '2' to double the internal resolution (recommended).\nPress 'h' to enable full internal resolution (requires a modern desktop computer).\nPress space bar to reload the work.\nPress 's' to save the output as PNG.\nTo render a 6k PNG, first press 'h', then save with 'p' (requires a modern desktop computer).\n\n\nMade with p5.js & WebGL.\nBest displayed with a modern desktop system & Chrome browser. \n\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",
