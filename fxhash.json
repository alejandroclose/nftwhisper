            "description": "On the surface, a Cellulaire is a surface! But notice; often porous, it's also a locus. \nLocus of millions of very tiny lines, one bit and one layer at a time connecting many dots. Different species of Cellular Automata (studied by John von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam, Stephen Wolfram, and John Horton Conway) the surface hosts. The little cells interact with their neighbors following simple rules. To express themselves, in multitudes of colors, they have evolved novel gene pools.\n\nA Cellulaire may have inside itself yet bigger cells; those created by its surface intersecting itself. And on its membrane that is porous, it hosts whimsical vesicles, or maybe a lotus; sometimes hiding in private quarters, draped with fanciful silk, velvet, or lace.\n\nBut let's go beyond all this hocus pocus.\n\nSome Cellulaires look like chapels; light peeking through their stained glass windows. Others look more like walled gardens, orchards, or vineyards of grapes. And some look like modern architectural spaces; have you ever stood or walked inside the Sequence (by Richard Serra)? To me, a Cellulaire is a meditation about life itself: how all systems and organisms, natural or man-made, are modular and cellular, built from smaller subsystems with their own boundaries and membranes, that interact, communicate, and evolve together, giving rise to ever more complex systems, patterns, structures, and behaviors. \n\nWith all that, the lotus now invites you to a meditative focus while this opus is rendered on its locus.\n\nControls:\n- Click the mouse to pause/unpause.\n- Press 's' to save a PNG file.\n- Press 't' to toggle, for a larger and higher resolution version that might be partially off screen. Once fully rendered, save a bonus 4800x4800 PNG file by pressing 's'. Toggle back to the original size by pressing 't' again.\n\nLicense:\nSee included LICENSE.md\n\nCredits:\nMade in p5js.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

In the end, he decided to destroy himself to make a New cosmos of all generative planets from ash of himself and his daughter's soul to one more time in the eternity they can be with each other in a heart of a planet.

Others look more like walled gardens, orchards, or vineyards of grapes. And some look like modern architectural spaces; have you ever stood or walked inside the Sequence (by Richard Serra)? To me, a Cellulaire is a meditation about life itself: how all systems and organisms, natural or man-made, are modular and cellular, built from smaller subsystems with their own boundaries and membranes, that interact, communicate, and evolve together, giving rise to ever more complex systems, patterns, structures, and behaviors. \n\nWith all that, the lotus now invites you to a meditative focus while this opus is rendered on its locus.\n\nControls:\n- Click the mouse to pause/unpause.\n- Press 's' to save a PNG file.\n- Press 't' to toggle, for a larger and higher resolution version that might be partially off screen.

It’s intended for small-scale print.\n\nAs a kid I was obsessed with Lego, Duplo, wooden building blocks... anything I could make something with.\n\nI’d spend hours building things, imagining new worlds, new machines, new concepts, then i’d take them apart and create a whole new idea to explore.\n\nTo me, this piece to me is a reminder of that time - many days spent exploring ideas with those simple objects - no care for viability, for marketability, for audiences or business. Just pure fun.\n\nWithout this time in my life, I doubt I’d have found my passion for creating in the way I do today.",

The little cells interact with their neighbors following simple rules. To express themselves, in multitudes of colors, they have evolved novel gene pools.\n\nA Cellulaire may have inside itself yet bigger cells; those created by its surface intersecting itself.
