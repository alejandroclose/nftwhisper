Atoms form gargantuan objects - subatomic monoliths and microscopic giants. Playing with the sense of scale it draws on the viewer’s subjective way of associating forms, a pattern that becomes a mirror, a skeleton for them to project. \n\nPart artist, part viewer. Leviathan asks us to question these relationships of creation, ownership and meaning. It is a chemical reaction that the artist starts and you finish.

            "description": "If light, which is generally a wave, can also sometimes be a particle - then can matter also be a wave? Louis De Broglie suggested this idea, which is supported by performing a double slit experiment with matter particles and producing an interference pattern that indicates wave behaviour. Performing the experiment with one particle at a time also produces an interference pattern, implying the particles create interference with themselves. One way this could be possible is if the particle travels infinite potential paths simultaneously, super positioning itself in many places at once. If one electron can be in infinite places at once, is it possible that all electrons are that same one? More than thinking everything is connected, can we go one further and think that everything is the same thing? \n\n'Matter Waves' super positions connections between constellated nodes, spreading them out through space in multiple ways - an aesthetic exploration of these ideas. \n\n's' to save large file\n'1' to watch it load slowly \n'2' to watch it load super slowly\n\nFully live code in p5js\n\nwww.amygoodchild.com\n@amygoodchild",
