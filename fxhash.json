All seven palettes in this project were sampled from the album cover for Insolito by Tipper (https://tipper.bandcamp.com/album/insolito). \n\nThe project title is a play on insolito meaning \"unusual\" and the featured bubble-like cellular noise. These bubbles are used to warp low-frequency simplex noise. When combined with the vibrant palettes, striking psychedelic patterns appear.\n\nControls:\n\n[space] or click to toggle animation\n[r] to reset animation to static view\n[s] to save as 4000x4000 PNG\n[t] to toggle paper texture\n\n#genuary32nd",

The human settlements are growing like huge organisms – and the growth is often impossible to plan, control or limit.\nCities as a phenomenon are with their incredible complexity highly enigmatic structures, that are as fascinating as they are terrifying.\n\nThis project is a study of the beauty of complexity.\n\nEach city iteration is an entirely unique structure with unique hatching, arrangement of buildings, heights, sizes, additions and rare items.\nThe cities are made even more organic by the meticulous modelling of analog ink drawing.\n\nThe project is 100% generative. All lines, hatching and dots are generated for each iteration.\n\nAs a gesture of appreciation towards our supporters, 20% of royalties will go to the original minter.\n\nKey commands:\nPress 's' to save a png version\nPress '2' to render at twice the resolution\nPress 'b' to remove the colored background before saving\n\nThe loading progress is animated, hence the epileptic trigger warning.\nDue to memory constraints on mobile devices, rendering uses a lower resolution on these.\n-----------\n\nOriginal concept by @Lax_raven\nAll code by @r1b2art",

            "description": "Fragment Assembler is a chaos engine that creates complex abstract patterns and textures. As the artwork is drawn, it constantly recomposes itself during assembly with a series of displacement techniques, creating new forms and visual elements, while others get broken into pieces and textures. The work is orientation agnostic, and will display the output in portrait orientation on tall displays.\n\nIntended to display on high resolution mode. The artwork renders with lower resolution by default to maintain compatibility with lower end devices. \n\nPress '2' to double the internal resolution (recommended).\nPress 'h' to enable full internal resolution (requires a modern desktop computer).\nPress space bar to reload the work.\nPress 's' to save the output as PNG.\nTo render a 6k PNG, first press 'h', then save with 'p' (requires a modern desktop computer).\n\n\nMade with p5.js & WebGL.\nBest displayed with a modern desktop system & Chrome browser. \n\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

Looking within isn't hard, it's just a glance and knowing, but it's painfully hard to see.\n\nDisjointed, you tell yourself over and over again that it wasn't for lack of effort.\n\nBut, is it? Looking within isn't hard, it's just a glance and knowing, but it's painfully hard to see.\n\nPerhaps you weren't so lonely, perhaps you're not lonely after all.\n\n=== \n\nCAUTION \n\nPlease be aware that this artwork demands a certain level of CPU power due to the substantial number of elements that need to be rendered on the canvas.
