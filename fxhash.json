Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch D (Disruption). The grid is broken. The color palette from Sketches A, B, and C remains. Most outputs are simply single colors or black and white. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.\n\nPress the spacebar to see the unDisturbed structure.",

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

Look closely and see that the lines are made of thousands of tiny dots. Iterations vary by color scheme, background color, line thickness, density, and more, with a small chance of using a rainbow color palette.  \n  \nPress R to re-run the drawing animation; enter to save the image in high quality. Enjoy!",

            "description": "On desktop, open project in live view and click “S” to download STL file (printable / experimental)\nRotate and zoom with the mouse to explore the model\n\nCityblocks: Genesis\n\nIn the Cityblocks series, urban ensembles are generated with a simple click. With each iteration appears a new densely built city block. Graced with impeccable geometrical lines, devoid of any human presence, these buildings remind us of brutalist utopias like Le Corbusier’s Cité radieuse or Niemeyer’s Brasilia. But despite their clearly modernist feel, there is something hauntingly primitive about them. They could be either New Mexican adobe pueblos, Minoan palaces, or Turkish troglodyte dwellings. Both carved and sculpted, these Ghormenghasts of concrete float in a realm out of time, like in some architect’s dream.\n\nThe purpose of this creative work is to generate 3D architectural projects that could be implemented in the real world. The accelerating lives that we live, complicated by growing and unpredictable environmental crises, call for an enhanced capacity to come up quickly with new architectural solutions adapted to different contexts. From computer assisted design to 3D printing, from augmented reality to real-life housing, from sculpture to architecture, this work aims at bridging the gap between the virtual and the tangible.\n\nWorking as a visual artist, David Umemoto draws inspiration from his training as an architect. He has been using low-tech methods for a long time, refining his talent for elegant simple shapes and combinatory constructions. Now, poured concrete and home-made moulds are giving way to zero-gravity rotating models. The skills he developed while working with real objects find a new playground in the virtual realm.\n",

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",
