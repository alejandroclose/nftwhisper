It’s intended for small-scale print.\n\nAs a kid I was obsessed with Lego, Duplo, wooden building blocks... anything I could make something with.\n\nI’d spend hours building things, imagining new worlds, new machines, new concepts, then i’d take them apart and create a whole new idea to explore.\n\nTo me, this piece to me is a reminder of that time - many days spent exploring ideas with those simple objects - no care for viability, for marketability, for audiences or business. Just pure fun.\n\nWithout this time in my life, I doubt I’d have found my passion for creating in the way I do today.",

The fact is that, according to a few millennia of research, there are a limited number of distinct human emotions, predefined by the human psyche. Sometimes it may seem like we are experiencing a \"new\" one, but on closer inspection, we see that it is the known emotions that are superimposed. Emotions are what they are, and they exist in the same way in each of us, whether we recognize them for what they are or not. But as our history blends into a new emerging state of the world, a whole new range of emotional responses are triggered within us. An infinite maelstrom of variations generated from a simple combination of a few emotions.\n\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nInland Emotions by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "“Southern Gothic” is my debut release on the fxhash platform. The project is created entirely through code. All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n“Southern Gothic” borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",

            "description": "“Southern Gothic” is my debut release on the fxhash platform. The project is created entirely through code. All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n“Southern Gothic” borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",

            "description": "This is an algorithmic tribute to the pioneering work of Anna Atkins (1799-1871). Considered by many the first female photographer, Atkins learned about the cyanotype process soon after it was invented by John Herschel, a family friend. As a botanist, she had the idea of using the new technique to produce contact prints of plants. Her investigations succeeded in capturing the nuances in morphology and the delicate details of many species.\n\nIn 1843 she published “British Algae: Cyanotype impressions”, the first published book to use a photographic process for the illustrations. Each copy gathered around 400 prints, each of them individually produced from a different specimen. Thus, all books featured the same species, but each of them was different, in a process that was itself generative in a certain way. Today, about 17 copies of the book are preserved in different institutions.

            "description": "This is an algorithmic tribute to the pioneering work of Anna Atkins (1799-1871). Considered by many the first female photographer, Atkins learned about the cyanotype process soon after it was invented by John Herschel, a family friend. As a botanist, she had the idea of using the new technique to produce contact prints of plants. Her investigations succeeded in capturing the nuances in morphology and the delicate details of many species.\n\nIn 1843 she published “British Algae: Cyanotype impressions”, the first published book to use a photographic process for the illustrations. Each copy gathered around 400 prints, each of them individually produced from a different specimen. Thus, all books featured the same species, but each of them was different, in a process that was itself generative in a certain way. Today, about 17 copies of the book are preserved in different institutions. Atkins went on to publish two more books in the following years, with the help of her friend Anne Dixon, dedicated to various ferns and plants.\n\n“Cyanotypes” pays homage to her wonderful work, which sits at the intersection between science and art, and used technology in a novel way to capture the beauty of nature. Here things are taken one step forward, to generate algorithmic simulations of plants, ferns, and algae, which are the work of fantasy and not necessarily faithful to the traits of any real species.\n\nThe work features 28 basic configurations, each of them in turn capable of unlimited variations.

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",
