            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

The colors, textures, and movements of the artwork are all meticulously crafted through code, with every detail carefully considered to capture the essence of these natural wonders.\n\nThe use of pure code to generate these landscapes serves to highlight the beauty and complexity of mathematics and computer programming. \nIt is a testament to the power of technology and its ability to create stunning works of art that evoke deep emotions and inspire creativity.\n\nAs you gaze upon the art, you are drawn into a world of tranquility and natural beauty. The peacefulness of the mountains and the endless expanse of the ocean come to life, inviting you to explore and discover the wonders of the natural world. \nThis art project is a celebration of the beauty of nature and the incredible potential of generative art.\n\n\nby Samanta and Rosetta196 2023",

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

            "description": "------------\nIntroduction\n------------\nArgentina is world-renowned for its exquisite wine, and the Malbec grape has long been a celebrated variety. While most of the country’s wine comes from the region of Cuyo, specifically the province of Mendoza, there is another hidden gem that is often overlooked: Entre Rios.\n\nNamed after the two massive rivers that surround it, Entre Rios is a province located in the northeast of Argentina. What many people don’t know is that it boasts a long and fascinating history of wine production that dates back to the early 19th century.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Entre Rios, I had the pleasure of exploring a small vineyard located near the Parana river. As I walked among the vines, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by their vibrant colors, intricate patterns of the leaves, and the beautiful clusters of grapes. It was clear to me that there was something truly special about the vineyards of Entre Rios.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the region’s history, I discovered that until 1937, Entre Rios was one of the largest wine producers in the country, with over 60 vineyards operating in the province. However, a national law was passed that year creating the Regulating Board of Wine, which concentrated and granted exclusivity to wine production in Cuyo. It wasn’t until 1993 that the law was repealed, allowing vineyards to be planted and modified throughout the country.\n\nToday, Entre Rios is home to a small but thriving wine industry that is known for its unique blends and varietals. One of the most notable grapes is the Tannat, which was once the predominant variety in the region.\n\nInspired by the beauty of these vineyards, I decided to create a generative art collection that celebrates the colors, shapes, and textures of the grapes and vines called ‘Lorda’.\n\n\n-----------\nAbout Lorda\n-----------\nTannat originates in southwest France (Madiran). However, it was not very admired there, so Tannat began its journey: it moved to our country, in the trunks of a Basque, Juan Jauregui, and settled in Entre Rios towards the end of the 1800s. This farmer nicknamed “El Lorda” planted Tannat in Concordia and managed to make a quite respectable wine. The grape took that nickname and became known as Lorda.\n\n\n-----\n\nPress \"e\" to save a high res png while in live mode.\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2023)\n\nMade with P5js and <3",

The colors, textures, and movements of the artwork are all meticulously crafted through code, with every detail carefully considered to capture the essence of these natural wonders.\n\nThe use of pure code to generate these landscapes serves to highlight the beauty and complexity of mathematics and computer programming. \nIt is a testament to the power of technology and its ability to create stunning works of art that evoke deep emotions and inspire creativity.\n\nAs you gaze upon the art, you are drawn into a world of tranquility and natural beauty. The peacefulness of the mountains and the endless expanse of the ocean come to life, inviting you to explore and discover the wonders of the natural world. \nThis art project is a celebration of the beauty of nature and the incredible potential of generative art.\n\n\nby Samanta and Rosetta196 2023",

            "description": "The 'Unfinished Loom' is a generative system that produces variations of itself through rotations, displacements, and self-repetition. \n\nSelf-similarity in the loom is achieved by repeating the double grid system and its elements vertically (using the 'o' and 'l' keys) and horizontally (using the 'i' and 'k' keys).\n\nPressing 'a' produces automatic changes, while pressing 'x' reverts to the original composition.\n\nBy clicking on the canvas, you can play with colors and transparency. \n\nThe '1' key toggles between disorder and order. \nThe '2' and '3' keys allow you to toggle displacements.\nThe '4' key enables you to switch between entropy or not.\nThe '5' key lets you switch between mixed textures or assigned textures. \n\nYou can reduce, amplify, or flip the displacement using the 'u' or 'j' key. \nTo remove a color press 'c'. To reset to all colors, press 'v'.\n\nYou can save a PNG file using 's', a JPG using 'd', a PNG with twice your window height using 'f', and a print size image using 'g'.\n\nThis work explores composition based on generative double grid system, where rotations, displacements and noisy lines intertwine to form a playful loom.\n\nCreated with p5.js rendering in WEBGL.",

            "description": "------------\nIntroduction\n------------\nArgentina is world-renowned for its exquisite wine, and the Malbec grape has long been a celebrated variety. While most of the country’s wine comes from the region of Cuyo, specifically the province of Mendoza, there is another hidden gem that is often overlooked: Entre Rios.\n\nNamed after the two massive rivers that surround it, Entre Rios is a province located in the northeast of Argentina. What many people don’t know is that it boasts a long and fascinating history of wine production that dates back to the early 19th century.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Entre Rios, I had the pleasure of exploring a small vineyard located near the Parana river. As I walked among the vines, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by their vibrant colors, intricate patterns of the leaves, and the beautiful clusters of grapes. It was clear to me that there was something truly special about the vineyards of Entre Rios.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the region’s history, I discovered that until 1937, Entre Rios was one of the largest wine producers in the country, with over 60 vineyards operating in the province. However, a national law was passed that year creating the Regulating Board of Wine, which concentrated and granted exclusivity to wine production in Cuyo. It wasn’t until 1993 that the law was repealed, allowing vineyards to be planted and modified throughout the country.\n\nToday, Entre Rios is home to a small but thriving wine industry that is known for its unique blends and varietals. One of the most notable grapes is the Tannat, which was once the predominant variety in the region.\n\nInspired by the beauty of these vineyards, I decided to create a generative art collection that celebrates the colors, shapes, and textures of the grapes and vines called ‘Lorda’.\n\n\n-----------\nAbout Lorda\n-----------\nTannat originates in southwest France (Madiran). However, it was not very admired there, so Tannat began its journey: it moved to our country, in the trunks of a Basque, Juan Jauregui, and settled in Entre Rios towards the end of the 1800s. This farmer nicknamed “El Lorda” planted Tannat in Concordia and managed to make a quite respectable wine. The grape took that nickname and became known as Lorda.\n\n\n-----\n\nPress \"e\" to save a high res png while in live mode.\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2023)\n\nMade with P5js and <3",

            "description": "In the collaborative project for The Fable, Kristen and Iofeye are exploring questions and themes in the space where human-technology-nature intersect. Based on AI generated fable-like creatures and fictional language, combined with intuitively created analog signs as well as sound, they are playing with the idea of telling possible stories about these creatures through different unpredictable generative results. More than a predetermined story, the project is a kind of a contemplation and a question about the crucial role of language, story and imagination in our relationship to the natural world around us and the technology that we develop and engage with.\n\n\nKristen Applegate\nhttps://kristenapplegate.crevado.com/ \n\nAs an artist, I am inspired by the intersection of technology and traditional craftsmanship. My work often uses humor to make playful yet thought-provoking statements about the consumption of animals, insects, and even humans as food. Recently this exploration has taken the form of creating AI images that become actual or projected surface decoration for pieces of ceramic dinnerware. Prompt-crafting with AI interfaces such as Midjourney and DALL-E allows me to create the odd animal-like storybook characters as well as the imaginative renderings of meat that appear in my work. My “anti-tale” characters are depicted in a vintage style that adds an element of nostalgia.\nFor our Floor project, Iofeye and I are delving further into the notion of storytelling using the extra anti-tale characters who did not make the cast list for my ceramic work. In this project, they get to tell their own stories in their own languages. I'm excited to hear what they say.\n\n\nIndira Iofeye\nhttps://linktr.ee/iofeye\n\nMy art is characterised by experimentation, exploration and intuitive expression and I am drawn to the potential that lies in collisions and connections between different media, expressive formats and conceptual universes. I am fascinated by the hybrid creations, by unlikely collisions and combinations, unpredictable turns and “mistakes”. For me, art and the artistic process are not solely about expressing something that already exists or is known, but also a way to ask and address questions about multiple aspects of existence, self, world and our relationships to different phenomena. It is also about opening up to a discovery and the encounter with the unknown inside oneself and the world through the creative process.\n\nSome of the themes that I have worked with and that occupy me are storytelling by different means, the role of myth and the phenomenon of language, its role in our self-imaginary and our relationship to it.\n\nThe combination, the intersection and the synthesis of different themes, concepts and modalities of work that Kristen and I have brought into the project has given rise to a really engaging and interesting collaborative process and generated new fascinating avenues of possible explorations and discovery.\n\n--\n\nThis token is part of The Floor Exhibit co-curated by the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC and Fort Gallery NFT.\n",

And you just need to look at things from a different angle to understand the Whole and the Minimum.\n\nThe 3D shapes animation is coordinated and responsive to the music played in the environment (there are 3 possible soundtracks).\nThis piece intends to create different impressions of the generated shape depending on the viewer's position. This is possible using the mouse Scroll up or down. You can explore as much as you like.\n\nEach generated part will belong to one of the Nine GenoME's. Its 3D parameters are dependent on the fxrand() function. This is done to add a simulation of genetic variability, however similarities will always exist in the same GenoMe.\n\nThis work is a collaboration between @nt_worm and @nax_of_malpas.\n\n(Click on the Screen to start the Soundtrack)\n(MouseScroll to explore different positions)\n(On Windowed mode use Shift + MouseScroll to move arround the enviroment)",
