            "description": "ecologías - A\n\nlines are a metaphor for the communication all species engage in. We as humans have a need to leave traces - stories - that others can read and learn from. What will be the traces machines want to leave? This piece employs sinusoidal signals drawn with lines as a simple metaphor for every trace and every language, for every message and every communication.\n\necologías-A is an entity that is part of a broader ecology. Released on occasion of the show \"Unbound - Ecology in the Age of Machines\" at Unit London. The data generated by this entity is read by a different piece minted on Ethereum, creating a link between Tezos and Ethereum, a metaphor for an ecology of blockchains.\n\nit shares a common element with two other works released on fxhash: ecologías B and ecologías C, all of them contributing data to aforementioned pieces.\n\nread more at https://www.iillucid.com/ecologias\n\n15% of primary sales are donated to institutions working towards improving biodiversity and environmental efforts.\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nBuilt on p5.js, glsl\n\nappend &pd=N (N a number) to the URL in live view to increase/decrease resolution\npress s to save current image in current resolution\npress z,x,g,b,n followed by +/- to increase/decrease, respectively, brightness, contrast, gamma, blur, noise",

            "description": "\"In the boundless loneliness of space, strangeness abounds.\"\nT E C T O N I C A logs\n\nStanding here are the digital engrams of a spacefaring civilization, the final remnants of the Universe's vast computer, a layered stratum of glitched, galaxy-sized digital memory banks. These calcified data deposits have accumulated over eons, forming physical tectons that span light-years of space. They offer a glimpse into the fundamental building blocks employed by a forgotten alien civilization which encoded its entire culture as digital data in physical form. While the specifications for this stellar machine have been lost to time, its fractured components continue to perform computations, seemingly trapped in an eternal loop. We can observe the inner workings of this enigmatic structure, but its true meaning remains forever silent, its message encrypted.\n\nT E C T O N I C A serves as an artistic exploration of this fictional world and its algorithm-driven deep-space geology. Collectors can reserve their iteration by minting a ticket and use the params interface to choose their seed number and triptych part. Generator uses a WYSIWYG principle to derive a PRNG seed from the wallet address and the chosen seed number. There are 1000 seeds available for each wallet. You can explore seeds using a separate seed explorer here:\n\nhttps://protocell-labs.github.io/tectonica-seed-explorer/\n\n__________\n\nT E C T O N I C A is written in JavaScript using Three.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry and in-browser rendering (see LICENSE file for the list of all dependencies). We recommend using Chromium browser on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration to get the full functionality (like key controls). Please ensure that the token functions correctly on your device before minting.\n\nUse click (touch) to explode / unexplode the structure, click hold (touch hold) to set new explosion center (also E + click), P for pause / unpause palette cycle, B to change background color, S to download loader animation, G for gif capture, and numbers 1-5 to export progressively higher resolution of the artwork as a png image. Available URL parameters are listed in the browser console.\n\nWe paid tribute to artists and personalities who inspire our work by naming color palettes after them. To support other fellow artists on their creative journeys, we have left T E C T O N I C A code open (unminified and unobfuscated) and available in a public repository on GitHub. We believe that supporting open tools is a mission every generative artist should partake in.\n\nCreated in 2024 by {protocell:labs}",
