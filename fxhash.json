            "description": "WTBS: Olympics Poster Edition is our official collaboration with Jeres, who was kind enough to work with us in support of the show. The project leans into classic Olympic poster design motifs, embellished by Jeres' signature approach to color and shape. Huge thanks to Jeres for donating their time and enthusiasm to this one, we hope you enjoy it!\n\nAs with all WTBS projects, your minting will directly support the podcast and keep us going (and more importantly, collecting!). Our goal is to keep the show free from ads and fully supported by the community, your donations and contributions continue to make that possible. Thank you in advance to everyone who chooses to mint!\n\nJeres: I love vintage posters. When going to second-hand shops, flea markets or wherever people are selling their used goods, I’m always on the lookout for what people used to hang on their walls. Bauhaus-inspired posters, socialist propaganda, Nagel prints, anything art deco, etc.. but whenever I come across something Olympics inspired I always feel like I hit pay dirt. There’s something about the clean, simple design being used to show people coming together along with the undertones of human excellence that just feels special. And circles. I love circles. I hope you enjoy this collection as much as I enjoyed putting it together with Trinity and Will.\n\nApproximate rarity notes:\n5%: Gold Edition\n10%: Silver Edition\n15%: Bronze Edition \n\nCommands in fullscreen mode:\nS : Save current resolution\n1 : Save 2000x3000px\n2 : Save 4000x6000px\n3 : Save 6000x9000px\n4 : Save 8000x12000px\n5 : Save 10000x15000px\n\n(The higher the resolution, the longer it takes to render/save. use Chrome for best results.)",

            "description": "Limina is a study of the fine line between order and chaos.\n\nEach piece of the collection is made up of just one or two lines. These lines are defined by thousands of points that are chosen, one by one, by a simple algorithm moving across the canvas. What arises from that simple concept is a surprising variety of intricate patterns, accidental symmetries and traces of order in chaotic structures. \n\nLimina is a meditation on the concept of emergence, a concept that lies at the heart of generative art. The algorithm that defines the core of the series is only capable of making one simple choice: left, right, up or down? As it moves across the canvas, it leaves a trace of points that are connected by a curve. The order in which these points are chosen and the tightness of the curve connecting them is what creates the visual diversity of Limina. As these values fluctuate, symmetries emerge and break down again, forms, patterns and ornaments are created and combined to form both complex structures and simple abstractions. \n\nLimina shows the potential of minimalist generative concepts to generate visually dense and unexpected results. \n\nPress 's' to save your image.\n",

            "description": "We are not the only inhabitants of the earth,\n\nThe earth does not belong only to humans\n\nFrom the seas to the deserts,animals face the ongoing threat of cruelty and abuse. Bears are captured and forced to fight dogs. Marine mammals, such as whales and dolphins, get trapped in discarded fishing gear. Wild animals are traded as exotic pets.\n\nWe should end the needless suffering of animals.\nWe should influence decision makers to put animals on the global agenda.\nWe should help the world see how important animals are to all of us.\nWe inspire people to change animals’ lives for the better.\nWe should move the world to protect animals.\n\n------------------\n\nThe lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not actively seek out and prey on humans. -- Wikipedia --",

            "description": "A study of building and destroying. I built this. You may knock it over.\n\nHumans are both creators and destroyers. One of the earliest games children learn to play is building with blocks, then knocking them down. This simple activity is teaching kids about gravity, cause and effect, and imposing their will on the world around them. As children grow older, the gap between these opposing actions widens. The intention behind knocking things down becomes less innocent, and creators aren't as excited to see their work destroyed.\n\nIn 1915, the Russian avant-garde founded the abstract art movement known as Constructivism, rejecting everything except for the absolute purest aspects of form and material. This art was used in service of the Russian revolution and utilized heavily in its propaganda, intended to highlight the utilitarian nature of industrial progress. Mainly, building the new Russia. Its influence is lasting, and can be seen throughout art and design trends even today.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, footage of missiles and airstrikes decimating Ukrainian buildings permeated the media. Ukrainian lives, kitchens, windowsill gardens, and family photos tumbled to the ground. Like children's blocks. Things that took a lifetime to build were destroyed in seconds. \n\nKONSTRUKTS represents this duality in creation and destruction. Stacked children's blocks are rendered in the style of Constructivist designs like El Lissitzky's Proun series, and Alexander Rodchenko's posters. With a simple tap, blocks (or buildings) can be knocked to the ground.\n\n- Tap anywhere to reveal the KONSTRUKTS menu in the top left. Tap the menu for several options.\n- KONSTRUKTS can be exported as USDZ or GLTF models to be used in augmented reality or the metaverse.\n- Export a full resolution PNG image from the menu.\n- If you knocked over the blocks, you can reset them from the menu.\n\nKONSTRUKTS is built entirely with code, using Three.js, JavaScript, and GLSL.",
