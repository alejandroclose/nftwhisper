            "description": "The algorithm to determine the shortest path between a set of points is a famous computer science problem, notoriously difficult, and known as the \"Traveling Salesman Problem\".\n\nThis piece is another entry in my study journal of algorithmic emergent systems, and is based on this famous problem. \n\nThis time, I used the following description:\n- Place N points randomly on the canvas, and assign a random direction to each point. \n- At each step, draw the shortest line that connects all the points, and move each point along its defined direction\n\nAs usual, each step is typically drawn with very low opacity, and is repeated hundreds of thousands of times. Eventually, the interaction between overlapping lines creates unexpected patterns and textures.\n\nThe recent introduction of the new fxparams system was a great opportunity to expose the inner workings of the algorithm and let collectors actively contribute to the final outputs. In my previous long form projects, parameters ranges were carefully limited to make sure all outputs were consistent. Here, exploration of extreme ranges is voluntarily left open, allowing collectors to come up with their own variations.\n\nWith this system, the collector becomes a critical part of the art creation process. In order to acknowledge that, 75% of the royalties will go to the minter.\n\nTo go with the spirit of this token, the total number of editions will also be an emergent property of the market: starting with a large supply of 10.000 editions, half the supply will be burned every Tuesday at noon EST, and the mint price will be increased by 1 tz.\n\nThis token uses the regl.js library. Higher resolution outputs can be generated by adding ?s=2 or ?s=3 to the live view URL. The 's' key will save the output as png.",

            "description": "🔥 BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY \"open edition\" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",

            "description": "The algorithm to determine the shortest path between a set of points is a famous computer science problem, notoriously difficult, and known as the \"Traveling Salesman Problem\".\n\nThis piece is another entry in my study journal of algorithmic emergent systems, and is based on this famous problem. \n\nThis time, I used the following description:\n- Place N points randomly on the canvas, and assign a random direction to each point. \n- At each step, draw the shortest line that connects all the points, and move each point along its defined direction\n\nAs usual, each step is typically drawn with very low opacity, and is repeated hundreds of thousands of times. Eventually, the interaction between overlapping lines creates unexpected patterns and textures.\n\nThe recent introduction of the new fxparams system was a great opportunity to expose the inner workings of the algorithm and let collectors actively contribute to the final outputs. In my previous long form projects, parameters ranges were carefully limited to make sure all outputs were consistent. Here, exploration of extreme ranges is voluntarily left open, allowing collectors to come up with their own variations.\n\nWith this system, the collector becomes a critical part of the art creation process. In order to acknowledge that, 75% of the royalties will go to the minter.\n\nTo go with the spirit of this token, the total number of editions will also be an emergent property of the market: starting with a large supply of 10.000 editions, half the supply will be burned every Tuesday at noon EST, and the mint price will be increased by 1 tz.\n\nThis token uses the regl.js library. Higher resolution outputs can be generated by adding ?s=2 or ?s=3 to the live view URL. The 's' key will save the output as png.",

            "description": "\"Before the Storm\" captures a fleeting moment of calmness amidst an impending tempest. Heavy clouds loom overhead, suffusing the air with palpable moisture and an alluring aroma. Majestic evergreens stand tall and proud, bravely facing the ominous yet strangely inviting sky. The air crackles with electrifying energy, foreshadowing the raw power of nature about to be unleashed. In this fleeting moment, one cannot help but be mesmerized by the sublime forces at play, but beware, the calm will not last forever.\n\nTechnical Note:\nIf you wish to render a high-quality version of your iteration, I strongly recommend increasing the resolution (press \"R\") and setting anti-aliasing to >1 (press \"A\"). However, be aware that it might take longer to compile and may not render at all on older hardware. To save the image, press \"S\".\n\nThe code has been tested on my old MacBook and on various Windows machines. For best results, use a modern Chromium-based browser, and make sure your browser supports WebGL 2.\n\nsuperbialux",

            "description": "A collaboration between leading British high-end audio brand KEF, generative artist hieroglyphica, and creative studio Parameta, Absorbed embodies the process of noise becoming high-fidelity sound through KEF’s Metamaterial Absorption Technology (MAT™). \n\nMAT™ makes the KEF sound what it is: absorbing unwanted distortion to deliver pure, accurate sound exactly as the artist intended. Inspired by this intricacy, Absorbed illustrates pseudorandom networks of patterns, slowly emerging and transforming into the maze-like form of MAT™. Clarity is revealed, noise is absorbed – high-fidelity is found.\n\nThe noise fields used in Absorbed are of two distinct types: conventional gradient noise and “sinusoidal” noise, an original algorithm developed for this series. The use of animation as artistic medium reflects the artists’ belief that no single frame can capture the full range of complexity found in the tension between sound and noise, and lets collectors observe for themselves this ever-shifting dialogue. A more extensive discussion of the algorithms used in Absorbed can be found in hieroglyphica’s companion article on fx(text).\n\n- spacebar will pause and resume the animation\n- s will save a still image of the current frame\n- technically minded collectors can consult the index.html file for info on how to render and save high-resolution images\n- use of hardware acceleration in Chrome may impact performance\n\nFounded by BBC engineer Raymond Cooke in 1961, KEF is a leading British innovator of high-end audio products including HiFi speakers, subwoofers, architectural speakers, wireless speaker-systems, and headphones.

            "description": "Looking at a motherboard seems like leaning over a busy city. Underneath the dense buildings (the components) runs at speed of electric fields an intricate transportation network that would drive any of our most practiced commuters crazy.\nDesigning circuit boards has been my job for a while. In addition to the technical approach I've come to deeply appreciate their aesthetical quality. The bond with generative art was striking to me.\n\nThe core code for \"Bright Circuits\" is a strict transcription of the rules at work when routing circuit tracks, i.e they can make 45° or 90° turns, they must respect a security gap between each other, and above all, they must never overlap. When the routing problem has no solution, we solve it by adding another layer of tracks, which communicates through soldered drill holes (Bright Circuits can have up to 3 layers).\n\nAt this point, the engineer in me got carried away by the art. As I was evolving from function to form, I started to imagine that the tracks where lifeforms driven by natural impulses, in an attempt to reach either freedom or a higher level of collective consciousness.\nDespite the advent of AI we know that something that still differentiates the human from the machine is the ability to both feel, and conceptualise the feeling ; the free will and the ability for undeterministic decisioning.\n\nCircuit tracks have managed to escape their boxed fate and arrange in shapes such as a circle, a heart, a skull (the components of a Vanity).\nThey now seek the experience of feeling. They have comprehended that feeling comes in a large palette of possibilities. Bright tracks are attracted to light (or positive moods), while dark tracks are running away from it (dark moods). The mix of both movements reflects the complexity of human feeling, which translates into a large variety of visual patterns.\nOccasionally, they will go as far as outpassing their fundamental electronics rules and display a breakthrough creative mindset through features called \"artistic rebellion\" and \"cartesian rebellion\". \"Bright Circuits\" will also communicate through a pair of human words their clumsy attempt at feeling and doubting.\n\n\n- press [s] in live view to export a PNG image file, between 9 and 8000 pixels wide.\n- press [enter] to stop the animation and go straight to the result\n\nCode in Vanilla Javascript + CSS\n\n10% of the royalties are for minters",

            "description": "Looking at a motherboard seems like leaning over a busy city. Underneath the dense buildings (the components) runs at speed of electric fields an intricate transportation network that would drive any of our most practiced commuters crazy.\nDesigning circuit boards has been my job for a while. In addition to the technical approach I've come to deeply appreciate their aesthetical quality. The bond with generative art was striking to me.\n\nThe core code for \"Bright Circuits\" is a strict transcription of the rules at work when routing circuit tracks, i.e they can make 45° or 90° turns, they must respect a security gap between each other, and above all, they must never overlap. When the routing problem has no solution, we solve it by adding another layer of tracks, which communicates through soldered drill holes (Bright Circuits can have up to 3 layers).\n\nAt this point, the engineer in me got carried away by the art. As I was evolving from function to form, I started to imagine that the tracks where lifeforms driven by natural impulses, in an attempt to reach either freedom or a higher level of collective consciousness.\nDespite the advent of AI we know that something that still differentiates the human from the machine is the ability to both feel, and conceptualise the feeling ; the free will and the ability for undeterministic decisioning.\n\nCircuit tracks have managed to escape their boxed fate and arrange in shapes such as a circle, a heart, a skull (the components of a Vanity).\nThey now seek the experience of feeling. They have comprehended that feeling comes in a large palette of possibilities. Bright tracks are attracted to light (or positive moods), while dark tracks are running away from it (dark moods). The mix of both movements reflects the complexity of human feeling, which translates into a large variety of visual patterns.\nOccasionally, they will go as far as outpassing their fundamental electronics rules and display a breakthrough creative mindset through features called \"artistic rebellion\" and \"cartesian rebellion\". \"Bright Circuits\" will also communicate through a pair of human words their clumsy attempt at feeling and doubting.\n\n\n- press [s] in live view to export a PNG image file, between 9 and 8000 pixels wide.\n- press [enter] to stop the animation and go straight to the result\n\nCode in Vanilla Javascript + CSS\n\n10% of the royalties are for minters",

It’s intended for small-scale print.\n\nAs a kid I was obsessed with Lego, Duplo, wooden building blocks... anything I could make something with.\n\nI’d spend hours building things, imagining new worlds, new machines, new concepts, then i’d take them apart and create a whole new idea to explore.\n\nTo me, this piece to me is a reminder of that time - many days spent exploring ideas with those simple objects - no care for viability, for marketability, for audiences or business. Just pure fun.\n\nWithout this time in my life, I doubt I’d have found my passion for creating in the way I do today.",

            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.
