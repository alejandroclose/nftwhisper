From there, I specifically developed it with non-plotter printing in mind, and more specific still, Riso Printing (think a scanner with a digital screen-printer MacGyver’d on). The palettes are taken from hex-estimated Risograph colour gamuts, with three layers being multiplied together to replicate, to some degree, the blending of the semi-transparent Risographic inks. Within this study, there’s a few different things going on, the initial setup is rectangles which cascade down the canvas, inheriting more extreme rotation as they get closer to the bottom (a la Schotter). The second is a subdivision of the shapes with filled circled, outlined circles and squares — since in this study the base shapes are rectangles and not squares, distribution of the ‘dithering’ can be larger than a single ‘pixel’ size — when these multiple layers overlap, the shapes produce a halftone-moire effect, forms and structures appear from the noise as the underlying patterns intersect. \n\ntx: Who?, Cosimo, Liam Egan, Andreas Rau, Louis\n\nLicensing: CC-BY-NC-ND ",

            "description": "Watch your computer perform \"digital marbling\" by dropping digital colored inks on digital liquid and shape it with its own little digital fingers and some not very honest laws of digital physics.\n\nViscous Circles is the first iteration on a brand new Wasm/Rust fluid simulation engine. I intend to produce other generators with the many other ideas for digital marbling. If you like it, don't hesitate to mint some tokens, it helps me finance my work as it requires lots of energy & time to mix both technical exploit and artistic creation.\n\n\nControls\n\nYou can stop at any step if you like the state at this instant, you can restart it, de/increase resolution (default is 4096x4096 to have sharp image, up to what your CPU/GPU can manage) and snapshot at any resolution.\n\n- H: hide/show help.\n- Space - pause/start animation.\n- R - restart animation.\n- I - hide/show res/fps panel.\n- A-Q/D - down/up full resolution\n- S - take full resolution snapshot\n\n\nThe story\n\nI'm fascinated by the ancient art of \"marbling\", specially Turkish marbling (Ebrû), Japanese marbling (Suminagashi) but also Italian marbling from Florence and others from Persia, India, etc... Marbling's idea is so simple: drop ink droplets of different colors, viscosity, quantity in a liquid and let fluids interact following laws of nature. If they can't mix, they will repel each other create evocative shapes with respect to the strength when you drop it. Sometimes, they'll mix a bit creating new colors. Then you can shape by moving, pushing color particles with pencils, creating wind on the surface etc... Possibilities are infinite. At the end, you \"print\" the creation on a paper you put on the surface of liquid that will \"drink\" the ink. For examples, check Ertugrul Incel, a Turkish artist making amazing creations with fantastic color & compositions that can be minted on NFT platforms https://twitter.com/ErtugrulIncel.\n\nYet, what fascinates me in marbling is not only the result but the process of creation: I love watching marbling artists shaping their creations, it's like magic. You'll find plenty samples on youtube.\n\nThus, I wanted to build a unique generator inspired by those techniques and artists yet very humbly, not pretending to reproduce real-life marbling or artists. I want it to be \"digital marbling\" with its own behaviors, visuals, limitations. And the most important: I want it to offer the marbling performance made live to my minters. Finally, we are in computer world so we can simulate physics but we are also not constrained by it so we can change physics. Thus, you'll see behaviors that are impossible in real-life (specially about curls & vortices).\n\nThis generator is also the result of a long technical exploration. I've spent couple of months building a Webgl/WASM/Rust/JS engine approximating Navier-Stoke fluid mechanics equation on GPU (and CPU too), strongly relying on existing great implementations https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation and https://shahriyarshahrabi.medium.com/gentle-introduction-to-fluid-simulation-for-programmers-and-technical-artists-7c0045c40bac themselves reproducing other works, specially those from Nvidia people. The rest of the work is my own touch to make it behave as I want first and then make the generative magic happen by randomizing creation until it starts to surprise myself. And I'm really surprised.\n\nNow, time to marble!\n\nViscous Circles @naibdian 2023 Project made using Opensource WebGL, WASM/Rust/JS libs\n",

Auction will stop changing price when non-reserves are fully minted.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nNature’s wild flourish and untamed growth wondrously represent the exacting function of beauty — a function that is at once useful and infinitely creative. Perhaps nowhere is this delicate symbiosis better observed than in the flower, wherein a pure balance of physical fundamentals exists beneath ornate patterns and elaborate aesthetics.\n\nAmongst the layers of undulating, vividly colored petals, attention-grabbing stigma and stamen, and lusciously decorative features, nature’s organic abundance and disorder disguises its masterful propensity for precision. Each of the flower’s components evolve through unpredictable interactions with an unwieldy natural environment, creating spectacular adaptations that emerge from the tension between what attracts.\n\nRococo painters appreciated the organic fluidity found in flowers and vegetal forms, using their joyful abundance to depict a break from the rigid and stoic period the artists hoped to leave behind. They sought to reframe perfection away from predictability and toward compositions as surprising as the natural world around them.\n\nThus, ‘Rococo’ is a generative distortion of an old tradition: a digital painting created entirely with code that interprets and processes the natural world’s dichotomies. This painting algorithm builds upon natural structures while melding and moving their colors beyond form, growing randomly organic iterations that are as perfect as they are imperfect.\n\nCreated by Ori Ben-Shabat & Ronen Tanchum @Phenomenalabs\nCreative contributions from Tender @tender_art\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTechnical Details:\n\n- Mobile/GPU Intensive\n- Press “s” to save a .png of the artwork in live view\n- Press “p” to render a high res output + press “s” to save a printable .png",

Through this artwork, I attempt to visually represent the complex and often overwhelming emotions that I experience on a daily basis. It is a reflection of the cyclical nature of my thoughts and feelings, and the ways in which I try to make sense of them. But as I delve deeper into my own personal experiences, I realize that in the end, internal chaos should not be controlled, but accepted.\n\nThis artwork is my most personal, as it reflects my innermost sensations. It is a reminder to myself and to others that it is okay to not have everything under control, and that it is important to allow the uncertainty and unpredictability of life. I hope that it will resonate with others and provide a sense of connection and understanding. It is a reminder that we are not alone in our struggles and that it is important to embrace our own imperfections.\n\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience. Chrome is highly recommended for high res saving.\n\nMade with love and p5js.\n\n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG 1200 x 1800\n[2] - save PNG 2400 x 3600\n[3] - save PNG 4800 x 7200\n[4] - save PNG 7200 x 10800\n\nOn mobile:\n[quick tap] - save PNG",
