Each piece is a visual representation of what lies within the depths of our unconscious minds and uses the power of circles and sacred geometry to symbolize totality, wholeness, and original perfection. By exploring the juxtaposition of depth and flatness, abstraction and figuration, shadow and brightness, this collection encourages us to confront and overcome the parts of ourselves that we may not want to face, but ultimately need to for our growth and healing.",

            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

            "description": "\"Rangxel\" is part of the live outdoor art installation - 'Computational Convergence' at India Art Fair, held from 9-12 February 2023 in New Delhi. \n\nRangxel is an interpretation of traditional Rangoli formations as tesseracts, combined to form monolithic structures. \n\nRangoli is a traditional artform that originated in India and is typically created during rituals and festivals like Diwali. It involves drawing intricate designs, typically on the floor, using materials such as colored powders, flowers, and grains. \n\nRangoli is meant to bring prosperity and happiness to a home and can range from simple geometric patterns to more complex depictions of nature.\n\nThe Rangxel tesseracts are created through rule-based instructions, following traditional Rangoli formation principles like symmetry, repeating patterns, and themes, resulting in interconnected, multi-dimensional forms of fragments.\n\nThese monolithic structures also reflect natural 3D grids found in nature such as crystals and honeycombs,presenting a deconstructed, pixelated matrix of our universe. \n\nUltimately, the reality we live in is an abstraction of the algorithm narrated by the creator.\n\n#StayPixelated\n\nControls (){\nDouble click Once to Enable Rotate around Tesseract;\nDouble click Twice to Disable  Rotate;\nDouble click Thrice to Go back original Composition;\nRotate , Zoom , Pan with Touch/Mouse;\n}\n",

The work depicts a cityscape at night, with the warm glow of streetlights and windows reflecting on the calm waters below. The moon casts a silvery light across the scene, imbuing the city with a magical quality that is both captivating and enchanting.\n\nIn the foreground of the work, a delicate paper boat floats on the sea, a symbol of innocence and childlike wonder. Its fragile presence in the vast expanse of the sea highlights the endless possibilities of exploration and the hope that accompanies the embarking of a new journey. Even the smallest vessel can set out on a journey of discovery.\n\nNocturne is a work that encourages us to slow down, breathe, and take in the beauty of the world around us. Invites us to immerse ourselves in a world of wonder and imagination that captures the beauty of the night and the magic of the city, at the darkest of times, where there is always a glimmer of light and hope to be found.\n\nNocturne's color palette is limited to blues, purples, browns, and greens, evoking the moody and atmospheric quality of the night.\n\nMoon Phase: Fool Moon, Waxing Crescent Moon\nBuildings: Apartment buildings with TV antennas, Gable roofs with chimneys\nStreet Lights: Globe, Modern\n\n100% code.\n\nPress [s] to save a PNG file with a minimum resolution of 4000px.",

            "description": "Eorisis is a generative artwork created by the movement of 1000 double pendulums. \n\nA double pendulum is a chaotic and complex system that generates a unique pattern with each swing. The lines vary in width and darkness, depending on the speed and amplitude of each pendulum's swing. The resulting drawn image is dense, visually striking, and sensitive to initial conditions, representing the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the system.\n\nThe complex and unpredictable nature of these images inspires feelings of awe and wonder as we attempt to comprehend the intricate patterns created by the pendulums. The image's dense and complex nature captures the observer's attention in an effort to understand the mathematical and physical principles behind the movement of the pendulums. At the same time, the repetitive and rhythmic movement of the pendulums in a seemingly effortless manner creates a calm and serene landscape.\n\nDuring the creation of the image we only see twenty of the one thousand double pendulums. \n\nEorisis (αιώρησις) in greek means swing; the periodic motion of a body whose orbit is a circular arc.\n\nWait for the progress bar to complete at the bottom of the canvas.\n\nAfter the render is completed, press [s] to save a 4000x4000px PNG file.",

            "description": "This project was started in December 2021. At that time, I didn't know what the result would be. It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file.
