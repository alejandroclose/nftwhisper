The construction of a visual poem without words. Where letters and other signs evoke movement, rhythm, sound, echo and silence. The work plays with processes of construction/deconstruction of characters, with the visibility or subtlety of typographic elements.\n\n*'Poema' is part of the 'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io).\n\n----------------------------------\nEach iteration has:\n-> an alternative version in Portrait format, activated by the [p] key\n-> a meta-poem, built from the features' metadata, accessible in the browser console, activated by the [F12] key\n\n----------------------------------\nFeatures:\n-> Encruzilhada (Crossroad) = 2 possibilities\n-> 3 types of Reverberations \n-> 6 types of Luminescences \n-> 5 Color schemes\n-> 14 Palettes \n\n* The names of the palettes pay homage to poets and artists who deal with the visuality of writing in their work. 7 palettes honor women, 7 palettes honor men.

This is because I have become more rebellious against the artworks on the market, and I wanted to \"Reconstruct\" them in my own interpretation.\n\nThe word \"ILL\" also has the meaning of \"Disease”. I found myself becoming more and more absorbed in this field as I created my own generative art. I would spend hours agonizing over an idea, and then I would devote myself to it for days until I was satisfied with my work! I can only think of this as a disease influenced by \"Madness”!\n\nIt is a wonderful thing to be so absorbed in something!\n\n//////////\n\nBit_Bio_Box is a noise() challenge for three-dimensional objects.\n\nThe organic pattern and cubes with different colors on each side give this work a three-dimensional feel and gorgeousness, making it a work that you can enjoy no matter how many times you look at it.\n\nIn addition, by creating cavities and gaps within the Cube, it gives the impression that only a part of the stratum of a particular biotope has been extracted.\n\n//////////\n\nSora Kuramochi",

            "description": "Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project. \n\nFile Size: 5100 x 6600\nPress ’s’ to save the image as a .jpg\nPress ‘p’ to save the images as a .png\n\n//= Tiller, 2024\n",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch E. Rebuilding after the disruption of Sketch D. Color palettes from A-D remain and more palettes are introduced based on Werner's Nomenclature of Colors, first published in 1814, which served as a classification guide for natural colors before photography became commonplace and used by Charles Darwin during voyages on the HMS Beagle. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.\n\nPress the spacebar to see the framework and press the left/right arrow keys to construct and deconstruct.",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch F(ree). A gift to all Sketch A-E collectors. The underlying grid structure from A-E remains, but more variation on size and distribution is added. Many more color palettes are introduced. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.",

No external libraries have been used.\n\n<space bar>: Pause the animation.\n0, 1, 2, 3, 4: Resolution, from lowest (0) to highest (4); default is 2.

The construction of a visual poem without words. Where letters and other signs evoke movement, rhythm, sound, echo and silence. The work plays with processes of construction/deconstruction of characters, with the visibility or subtlety of typographic elements.\n\n*'Poema' is part of the 'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io).\n\n----------------------------------\nEach iteration has:\n-> an alternative version in Portrait format, activated by the [p] key\n-> a meta-poem, built from the features' metadata, accessible in the browser console, activated by the [F12] key\n\n----------------------------------\nFeatures:\n-> Encruzilhada (Crossroad) = 2 possibilities\n-> 3 types of Reverberations \n-> 6 types of Luminescences \n-> 5 Color schemes\n-> 14 Palettes \n\n* The names of the palettes pay homage to poets and artists who deal with the visuality of writing in their work. 7 palettes honor women, 7 palettes honor men. Almost all from Latin America.\n\n----------control keys------------ \n[F12] access to the meta-poem on browser console \n----------------------------------\n[p] alternate format portrait/square \n[o] border on/off \n[e] save image with 2000 pixels height\n[m] save image with 4000 pixels height\n[a] save image with actual size\n----------------------------------\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n----------------------------------\nCreated with p5.js\nTested in Chrome and Firefox on both Windows and Mac OS.\n\n----------------------------------\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2024\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada\n\n----------------------------------\n*Please note: there are two reservation lists in this project:\n-> One for my supporters & anyone who has 4 or more editions from my previous projects\n-> Another one for those who have one piece from any of my projects (this list is overallocated, which means there are more people on it than available slots, so: first come, first served).\n*If you use more than one wallet, or the address on the reserve list is your vault, contact me via one of my social networks up to 12 hours before the drop.\n----------------------------------",

The construction of a visual poem without words. Where letters and other signs evoke movement, rhythm, sound, echo and silence. The work plays with processes of construction/deconstruction of characters, with the visibility or subtlety of typographic elements.\n\n*'Poema' is part of the 'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io).\n\n----------------------------------\nEach iteration has:\n-> an alternative version in Portrait format, activated by the [p] key\n-> a meta-poem, built from the features' metadata, accessible in the browser console, activated by the [F12] key\n\n----------------------------------\nFeatures:\n-> Encruzilhada (Crossroad) = 2 possibilities\n-> 3 types of Reverberations \n-> 6 types of Luminescences \n-> 5 Color schemes\n-> 14 Palettes \n\n* The names of the palettes pay homage to poets and artists who deal with the visuality of writing in their work. 7 palettes honor women, 7 palettes honor men. Almost all from Latin America.\n\n----------control keys------------ \n[F12] access to the meta-poem on browser console \n----------------------------------\n[p] alternate format portrait/square \n[o] border on/off \n[e] save image with 2000 pixels height\n[m] save image with 4000 pixels height\n[a] save image with actual size\n----------------------------------\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n----------------------------------\nCreated with p5.js\nTested in Chrome and Firefox on both Windows and Mac OS.\n\n----------------------------------\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2024\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada\n\n----------------------------------\n*Please note: there are two reservation lists in this project:\n-> One for my supporters & anyone who has 4 or more editions from my previous projects\n-> Another one for those who have one piece from any of my projects (this list is overallocated, which means there are more people on it than available slots, so: first come, first served).\n*If you use more than one wallet, or the address on the reserve list is your vault, contact me via one of my social networks up to 12 hours before the drop.\n----------------------------------",

The construction of a visual poem without words. Where letters and other signs evoke movement, rhythm, sound, echo and silence. The work plays with processes of construction/deconstruction of characters, with the visibility or subtlety of typographic elements.\n\n*'Poema' is part of the 'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io).\n\n----------------------------------\nEach iteration has:\n-> an alternative version in Portrait format, activated by the [p] key\n-> a meta-poem, built from the features' metadata, accessible in the browser console, activated by the [F12] key\n\n----------------------------------\nFeatures:\n-> Encruzilhada (Crossroad) = 2 possibilities\n-> 3 types of Reverberations \n-> 6 types of Luminescences \n-> 5 Color schemes\n-> 14 Palettes \n\n* The names of the palettes pay homage to poets and artists who deal with the visuality of writing in their work. 7 palettes honor women, 7 palettes honor men. Almost all from Latin America.\n\n----------control keys------------ \n[F12] access to the meta-poem on browser console \n----------------------------------\n[p] alternate format portrait/square \n[o] border on/off \n[e] save image with 2000 pixels height\n[m] save image with 4000 pixels height\n[a] save image with actual size\n----------------------------------\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n----------------------------------\nCreated with p5.js\nTested in Chrome and Firefox on both Windows and Mac OS.\n\n----------------------------------\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2024\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada\n\n----------------------------------\n*Please note: there are two reservation lists in this project:\n-> One for my supporters & anyone who has 4 or more editions from my previous projects\n-> Another one for those who have one piece from any of my projects (this list is overallocated, which means there are more people on it than available slots, so: first come, first served).\n*If you use more than one wallet, or the address on the reserve list is your vault, contact me via one of my social networks up to 12 hours before the drop.\n----------------------------------",

            "description": "fx(mash) is my humble contribution to celebrating #fxhashturnsone\n\nThis series is based on a simple algorithm - lines of a random length are drawn on a square grid until the grid is full.\n\nI have added a variety of features based on some of my favorite fxhash projects and a few special guests.\n\nThis collection is intentionally diverse and disorderly, that's a nice way of saying I only had a short period of time following the release of Acequia. As a result, some of the outputs might be weird, messy, or even bordering on broken (if you get one of the latter please let me know and I'll reimburse you).\n\nDespite being a bit rough around the edges, I hope fx(mash) reflects some measure of my love for the fxhash community. If you're feeling kind, then perhaps it even harks back to the experimental early days :)\n\nThe last year has been an incredible journey, thank you for letting me be a part of our story so far.\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press [s] to save the current image\n- Press [g] to toggle grain\n- Press [h] for a high-res output\n\nBeta Controls (in live view, definitely not fully tested):\n\n- Press [p] to start/pause animation\n- Press [i] to slow down animation\n- Press [o] to speed up animation\n\nAll primary sales go to Savepakistan.\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nfx(mash) uses Gorilla Sun's grain implementation, a big thanks to him and meezwhite for a great article that is well worth supporting https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/all-about-that-grain\n\nThank you to the artists who created the following collections.
