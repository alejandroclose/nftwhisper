            "description": "Individually, the mints of this token are very simple. Each mint generates half of two cube forms, and each half is assigned random hues (in multiples of 10, from 0 to 360). Collectively as a project, this token challenges the approach of looking for \"rarities\" in a new way. How the cubes are rendered leaves the possibility for multiple mints to potentially join up on the sides with colors that perfect match each other. Will you find your lost twin?\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated November 2021\nArtist: @Yazid",

            "description": "Everything is divisible. Larger organisms are made up of smaller ones, entire galaxies are comprised of stars, planets, people, dust, and one effect here and now ripples into eternity. Nothing exists without the elemental components that have evolved to make them possible — and nothing on the plane of existence arrives in isolation from something greater. This enmeshed reality is the concept of a Holon: a whole that is simultaneously part of another whole. \n\nAs cells, energies, beings, and ideas grow in complexity, each new advancement includes and transcends their holons, the very catalysts of evolution. What does this essential process look like on its own when scale, context, and definition are removed? The senses are forced to purely observe the present interactions and reactions that occur between all parts. This is what Holons attempts to portray — the witnessing of birth, formation, and crystallization simultaneously. \n\nUpon viewing each piece and inspecting its detail with curiosity — we can observe living reality that has been temporarily suspended from motion and artificially stopped for us to witness. Can we see what is a part, and what is a whole? Can we define what these holons are? \n\nLet each Holons remind us that the impossible can always be made; let each one be nothing and everything — organisms, cosmos, energy itself — all at once, for it’s the creation of something entirely new that best reminds us that everything is actually made of the parts already here. So, remember to create without barriers or limitations because reality itself is made of that which lives now only in imagination.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x flight404\nOctober 2022\n\nPress ‘h’ in live view to render a high resolution version of any token.\nPress ‘s’ in live view to save a .png of the current view of any token.\n\nHolons was created in vanilla Javascript and WebGL, but the majority of the work was done in GLSL shaders. This setup was substantially assisted by fx(hash) community leader and artist Liam Egan who provided technical assistance and emotional support during the project's lifespan. For this reason, we have included him in the split of proceeds.\n",

            "description": "Everything is divisible. Larger organisms are made up of smaller ones, entire galaxies are comprised of stars, planets, people, dust, and one effect here and now ripples into eternity. Nothing exists without the elemental components that have evolved to make them possible — and nothing on the plane of existence arrives in isolation from something greater. This enmeshed reality is the concept of a Holon: a whole that is simultaneously part of another whole. \n\nAs cells, energies, beings, and ideas grow in complexity, each new advancement includes and transcends their holons, the very catalysts of evolution. What does this essential process look like on its own when scale, context, and definition are removed? The senses are forced to purely observe the present interactions and reactions that occur between all parts. This is what Holons attempts to portray — the witnessing of birth, formation, and crystallization simultaneously. \n\nUpon viewing each piece and inspecting its detail with curiosity — we can observe living reality that has been temporarily suspended from motion and artificially stopped for us to witness. Can we see what is a part, and what is a whole? Can we define what these holons are? \n\nLet each Holons remind us that the impossible can always be made; let each one be nothing and everything — organisms, cosmos, energy itself — all at once, for it’s the creation of something entirely new that best reminds us that everything is actually made of the parts already here. So, remember to create without barriers or limitations because reality itself is made of that which lives now only in imagination.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x flight404\nOctober 2022\n\nPress ‘h’ in live view to render a high resolution version of any token.\nPress ‘s’ in live view to save a .png of the current view of any token.\n\nHolons was created in vanilla Javascript and WebGL, but the majority of the work was done in GLSL shaders. This setup was substantially assisted by fx(hash) community leader and artist Liam Egan who provided technical assistance and emotional support during the project's lifespan. For this reason, we have included him in the split of proceeds.\n",

            "description": "This project uses cellular automata where the state of a cell in a new generation is determined based on its own and its neighbors' states in the previous generation. The guiding rules for these transitions, however, are not static; they undergo a random change every few generations, chosen from a possible 256 rules. By also slightly shifting the positions of cells and using an outline and texture that conveys a hand-drawn style, I have tried introducing an element of organic randomness.\n\nStepping away from the monochromatic color scheme used in my last three series, I have used a gradient effect to convey a transitioning hue across generations, combining a palette of two colors selected from an array of 14 different palettes. \n\nNote on the name: The alternating rules and fluctuating cell positions serve as the apparent justification for its name. However, a subtler inspiration lies in my deep admiration for Franz Kafka and his remarkable short story, \"The Metamorphosis\". Kafka’s narrative explores the constantly evolving state of human existence, where patterns appear momentarily only to dissipate quickly. Just when you think you've spotted a pattern, poof, it changes. Just like in life, right :)\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

            "description": "\"Landscape painting is the contemplation of the earth's features made visible to us in their most perfect moments. It is the record of nature's beauty, which often appears like a momentary revelation; and its effect is to show us how much beauty is around us that we never attend to, and by whose presence we are cheered and elevated in unobserved and unsuspected hours of depression or anxiety.”\nJohn Ruskin\n\n In this collection, I aimed to design the essence of my utopia. Instead of my usual interactive and animated designs, I created a drawing that gives the impression of lithographic printing on 2D black paper, where textures remain static. I wanted the nature objects to have a slightly dark, somewhat Fauvist style. I sought a balance between their depressive nature and the hopeful tranquility of natural light sources, which evoked the feeling I was searching for.\n\n*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as png.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.\n\n“Stratification of the Orthogonal”\n“Agora of Timeless”\n“Surely, There is an Exit”\n\nEveryone who owns the above collections is entitled to a free mint right in this collection.

            "description": "“Matriisi” is a generative artwork exploring the artistic, visual and conceptual possibilities of matrices in generative abstract art.\n\nIt is designed to be a digital artwork, to be viewed from a high quality monitor or tv, or printed and framed. Contemporary life is getting more and more digitalized and almost everyone has a device with a high resolution screen. With this artwork I am aiming to enable art collectors, traditional and digital, to have an artwork they can enjoy from their screen or tv, and save wall space for traditional hand made art objects.\n\nThe artwork is orientation agnostic, there is no preferred way it is supposed to be looked or hanged.\n \n\nThe artwork is based on set of number matrices used as main compositional structure. This data is then interpreted to draw the visual elements: matrices of lines and dots. As a play on digital vs handmade, lines and shapes imitating drawing highlight the forms made by the matrices. \n\nThere are 10 different colour palettes, that can be also mixed together. These colours draw inspiration from different eras and styles of art. \n\nAs the artwork is developed based on visual variety, there will are no separate features, as these would add limitations to the range of the generator.\n\n40 iterations are reserved for live minting in the gallery during the exhibition.\n\nMatriisi is shown in Luisa Catucci Gallery in Berlin between 1.9.2022 and 1.10.2022 in the generative art exhibition “Improbable Iterations” together with Joonas Toivonen aka Toiminto. He is showing his artwork “Fragment Assembler” also out on FX(Hash). Welcome to the opening of the exhibition on 1.9.2022 16-19pm @ Allerstraße 38, 12049, Berlin. Both artists will be present.\n\nControls in live view:\n-Pressing j exports the current image as jpeg\n-Pressing p exports the current image as png\n\nTo change the detail level one can access the pixel density of render by adding &pixDens=3 to the end of the URL in live view. You can of course put number other than 4 also. I it renders just a black image, you have to lower the number, since it is then too large for WEBGL to render.\n\n\nMade with p5.js\n\nAntti Pussinen, in Berlin 26.8. 2022\n",

            "description": "\"初夏の旅路 Traveling in Early Summer\"\nis part of the interactive minting experience at Proof of X with KUMALEON, Tokyo, 2023.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nConcept:\n\nAs the rainy days came to an end, the gentle fall of cherry blossoms marked the arrival of early summer. This transitional phase between spring and summer brings a mild and pleasant climate. Nature awakens, showcasing vibrant shades of green as plants thrive and flourish. A stroll through the streets of Tokyo reveals a captivating sight: hydrangeas of various colors grace every corner, casting a spell of natural beauty. While the occasional typhoon may pass by, it does not overshadow the charm of this season. Moreover, the ripening plums offer a taste of traditional Japanese flavors, with options ranging from sour plums to plum wine.\n\nMy inspiration for this piece draws upon my own impressions of early summer in Japan. In 2019, having recently arrived in Japan, I embarked on a journey to Kamakura with my friends. The vivid hydrangeas and serene ponds at Hasedera Temple left an indelible mark on my memory as my first encounter with the essence of early summer in Japan. It was during that year that I delved into the realm of creative coding, by using Processing. The following year, in 2020, I ventured further into generative art using P5.js. Both my pursuit of knowledge in Japan and my creative endeavors became integral parts of my life's journey, akin to cherished scenic spots that leave a lasting impression. Through my artwork, I aspire to share my sentiments from this transformative voyage with the audience.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nNow, let's delve into the details of my creation. The objective of this artwork was to portray a top-down perspective of a pond encircled by lush vegetation, reminiscent of a landscape painting. To imbue the work with different atmospheres, I incorporated four distinct styles for the plant elements: grass, leaves, pine needles, and bubbles. The interplay of these elements breathes life into the still scene, infusing the entire artwork with vitality. The rippling water and gracefully swimming koi in the pond evoke a sense of movement, juxtaposing the serene setting. In Eastern culture, koi symbolizes wealth, auspiciousness, health, and happiness. It bestows good fortune upon those who encounter it. Ultimately, my artwork encapsulates my initial impression of early summer in Japan through a creative approach that intertwines reality and imagination, merging motion and stillness.\n\nThrough this artistic endeavor, I aim to transport the audience to the captivating realm of early summer in Japan. With its vibrant colors, gentle breezes, and the promise of new beginnings, this season captures the essence of natural beauty and the richness of Japanese culture. May my work resonate with viewers, allowing them to embark on their own journey through the enchanting landscapes of their imagination.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nSave as a Picture:\n\nPress “s”or “S” to download a PNG copy of the artwork.\n",

A small gift to celebrate the fledgling generative art/design community on Mastodon: 20 of the 128 tokens are given to some of the people in that slowly growing community, with the remainder given as Thank You (and smoke signal/sign of life) to some of my existing collectors, randomly chosen via lottery script[2].\n\n3.
