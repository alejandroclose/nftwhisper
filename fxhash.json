Some extreme sounds (frequency and amplitude) can be generated.\n\n-Supply can be halved/reduced and the price can be doubled if half supply has not been minted (every 24h aprox).\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n-a synthesizer generates the sound and this is represented visually.\n\n-the sitetizer has 3 possible modulations: FM, AM and phaser.\n\n-carrier and modulator canhave 3 different types of wave: sine, square or sawtooth.\n\n-the modulator is an LFO (or noise)\n\n-each piece consists of 8 steps.\n\n-each step has randomly generated synthesizer parameters, visualizations and duration.\n\n-after the first cycle, the parameters of each step can change with higher or lower probability randomly (fxrand).\n\n-that's why in this project there are no defined fxfeatures, since they can change in each cycle. So we get an infinite and unique sequence for each piece.\n\n",

Some extreme sounds (frequency and amplitude) can be generated.\n\n-Supply can be halved/reduced and the price can be doubled if half supply has not been minted (every 24h aprox).\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n-a synthesizer generates the sound and this is represented visually.\n\n-the sitetizer has 3 possible modulations: FM, AM and phaser.\n\n-carrier and modulator canhave 3 different types of wave: sine, square or sawtooth.\n\n-the modulator is an LFO (or noise)\n\n-each piece consists of 8 steps.\n\n-each step has randomly generated synthesizer parameters, visualizations and duration.\n\n-after the first cycle, the parameters of each step can change with higher or lower probability randomly (fxrand).\n\n-that's why in this project there are no defined fxfeatures, since they can change in each cycle. So we get an infinite and unique sequence for each piece.\n\n",

It links a thousand pairs of points, harmoniously shifting across the canvas, with delicate lines. At each intersection of these lines, color is applied. To produce the final piece, multiple layers of varying colors and intensities are superimposed.\n\n------\n\nControls:\n\n- [x] Save a PNG\n\n- [1] Set height to 768\n- [2] Set height to 1152 \n- [3] Set height to 1536 (default)\n- [4] Set height to 2304\n- [5] Set height to 3072* \n- [6] Set height to 6144*\n- [7] Set height to 9216*\n- [8] Set height to 11520*\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render height\n\n\n* images with height over 3000 pixels render without animating, downloads a PNG automatically after rendering\n\nPlease note that high resolution outputs will take several minutes or even longer to render.

            "description": "\"Naïf\": An Introspection on Naivety\n\nFrom childhood, naivety is perceived as innate. It embodies a form of purity, an absence of experience that could have altered its original essence. In young adults or adults, especially in our productivity-focused societies, naivety is often seen as a weakness, a dysfunction, or even an exploitable incompetence, subject to mockery. As if the hardening process, deemed necessary to make an individual apt and conforming, had not operated satisfactorily.\n\nHowever, it is paradoxical to note that literature, as well as our personal experiences, are filled with examples where an adult's naivety is a strength, a means to overcome and transcend numerous obstacles. It's also a choice, conscious or unconscious, to apply a filter to the reality we observe and engage in.\n\nWith advanced age, there is often a return to this naivety, a rediscovery of that lost innocence. In the elderly, this quality becomes, in a way, normal and even desirable, especially when it doesn't stem from illnesses. It reflects a form of wisdom and resilience in the face of life's complexity, a way to lighten oneself before departure.\n\nStarted with doors attached to an unfinished perspective, this project became quite obsessive until revealing a meaning that I perceived as this introspection on naivety. Between art therapy and personal reflection, this work is a journey in which I visually experimented with some of my convictions that I, along the way, deconstructed.\n\nTo materialize this reflection, I designed a simple drawing, naively representing a set of celestial bodies and birds through cognitive doors. These doors, fixed on a stable structure without alteration, rest on a uniform background with a slight grain.\n\nFrom this original view, I then revisited each element, altering them individually before recombining them. Constructing a background of simple objects, books, and childish patterns. I added a ground and clouds to anchor this confrontation to the terrestrial. The doors combine, opening to a broader vision while reducing the number of viewpoints. The structure is distorted, dissonant, resonant, colorful, sometimes overly so, even amplified, mirroring our personal structures constantly changing and confronted by life. The doors merge, increasing the surfaces and reducing the viewpoints. The birds have changed, the celestial bodies have moved, becoming denser, taking up more space, colliding, and tearing apart. Transparency emerged, allowing a glimpse of the entirety through our own doors. The reflections of different plans connect.\n\nFrom anarchic coloring, the lines are immature, the encounters are random. This choice reflects again the desire to preserve the dissonance induced by certain encounters and the space they occupy in our internal mechanics.\n\nThis approach produced an image oscillating between disharmony and interest; sometimes pleasant, sometimes less so, even hostile or incomprehensible.\n\nThis project, in its execution, is entirely random. It was created using the p5.js, p5.noise, and chroma.js libraries.\n\nThe \"S\" key saves the three created images.",
