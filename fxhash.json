            "description": "The initial spark for this piece started with Armin Hofmann’s exercises in style and composition. Just as George Nelson wrote in the preface to Armin’s book Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practices: \"Despite all our efforts to simplify things - efforts constantly expanding in order to keep abreast of steadily increasing complexity - nothing is very simple anymore\", these explorations just opened doors to other issues, and further grounded the idea that \"if problems can be correctly stated, they can be solved.\"\n\nArmin suggests we go back to the beginning, to concern ourselves with dots and circles and lines and then bring opposed components in confrontation. \"Confrontation is a theme on which variations can be played with any desired consonances, with any imaginable values, and in a great variety of ways. [...] (Only then) (s)he will be able to find creative solutions to the problems presented by the confrontation of opposites.\"\n\nVery quickly opposed components, even with extending the angle of vision from the two-dimensional surface to the three-dimensional space, and with the contrasts of thin-thick, solid-transparent, softened-hardened line, etc., started looking like I’m weaving complicated plots, visually similar to textile works by  Bauhaus women - Gunta Stölzl, Anni Albers, Gertrud Preiswerk and others.\n\nWhen Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919, he proclaimed that “every eligible person whose talent and training are considered adequate will be accepted without regard to age and sex.” However, in practice, discriminatory gender roles were reinforced, and female students were guided and advised to work with textiles rather than in workshops for heavy crafts such as carpentry. Despite that, Gropius’s “women’s section” became one of its most collaborative and brave experimental sectors. \n\nA hundred years later, it is disappointing to see we still carry on with inherited gender roles. Check the number of female computer science students in your country. How are things going \"at the intersection of arts and technology\"? I've implemented some of the percentages from Serbia in the distribution of shapes in the final compositions. I sampled the number of female vs. male students at the Faculty of Mathematics and the University of Arts (where I studied and now work), and gender distribution among graduated students, and it didn't look bad at all. But then I realized I'm the only female professor (out of 5) teaching main subjects at doctoral studies program in digital arts.\n\n\"When a group is underrepresented, people come to take that underrepresentation as the norm.\" Since representation is imperative to achieving equality, it is equally critical to change the biases we’ve developed over centuries.\n\nFor the title, I chose a dated version of the word for a female weaver on purpose. My native language is one of the Slavic languages, which are all gender sensitive. It is natural to have feminitives, but since historically some occupations were less (or not at all) practiced by women, many of the feminitives for those professions, jobs, and specializations are rarely used or don't exist in the dictionary. Also, not surprisingly, the dominant version of the noun describing a person who weaves in Serbian would be the female noun \"tkalja\", whereas the male version is so rare that is missing from some dictionaries. Conscientiously choosing the female version of the noun for the title, I position myself and this piece in the historical context with Bauhaus weveresses, contemporary language, and gender contexts, and finally in the curatorial context of the exhibition. \n\nCode Weaveresses is part of the FEMGEN exhibition curated by Micol Ap @verticalcrypoto in partnership with @RtClick_Save and @artblocks_io.\n",

            "description": "A mix of aesthetics from the Ukiyo-e and Shin-hanga woodblock movements, with modern elements.  \n\nukiyo-e (浮世絵) = \"pictures of the floating world\", which peaked in the late 19th century. \nshin-hanga (新版画) = \"new prints\", from roughly the 1920-1950s. \n\nSome comparisons between the prints of the Japanese masters and gen-art: \n\n* The number of prints. Based on how well a piece was received, the publisher could decide to produce more copies, usually in batches of 200. Compare this to limiting the edition size on fx(hash). The initial prints would have sharp lines and accurately coloured areas. Very popular prints with thousands of impressions would slowly degrade the blocks, leaving final prints with worn-out linework and colours that weren't true to originals.  \n\n* Woodblock prints were actually a collab between the artist, the wood carver, and the printer. In many cases only the artist and publisher were recognized on the final prints. It was usually the publisher who owned the woodblock, not the artist. Often the artist was considered a worker, contracted at the request of the publisher or patrons funding the project. Compare this to the NFT space, where ownership is carved onto the blockchain, and artists have freedom to create whatever they wish. \n\n* Copyminters.... Similar to the NFT world, fake publishers sprang up from time to time, who would reproduce famous prints. Enji Takamizawa was one such counterfeiter, who was able to skilfully produce woodblocks replicating originals down to the wood grain! \n\n* While fine-quality woodblock prints from the Edo era command huge auction prices today, they were in reality affordable art for the regular people of their time. NFTs are similar in this light, where we can enjoy pieces at home rather than say, visiting galleries or museums of unattainable art. \n\n\n\nAdditional querystring params (use when viewing in a separate window) \n\n* fullsize=true (33 megapixel output) \n* colourcorrect=false \n* grain=false \n* border=false \n\n\n\nLicenses included in source. Relying on: \n\n* PIXIJS for drawing \n* JSTS for geometry functions \n* chromajs for colour functions \n* noise and gaussian helpers from p5js ",

            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

This can be toggled off by adding “&b=0” to the url.\nThe background scales with resolution to mimic a bigger canvas so it will look different at different resolutions.\nAt high resolutions a Moiré pattern may appear on the canvas background texture due to the way images are resized in the browser.

            "description": "A mix of aesthetics from the Ukiyo-e and Shin-hanga woodblock movements, with modern elements.  \n\nukiyo-e (浮世絵) = \"pictures of the floating world\", which peaked in the late 19th century. \nshin-hanga (新版画) = \"new prints\", from roughly the 1920-1950s. \n\nSome comparisons between the prints of the Japanese masters and gen-art: \n\n* The number of prints. Based on how well a piece was received, the publisher could decide to produce more copies, usually in batches of 200. Compare this to limiting the edition size on fx(hash). The initial prints would have sharp lines and accurately coloured areas. Very popular prints with thousands of impressions would slowly degrade the blocks, leaving final prints with worn-out linework and colours that weren't true to originals.  \n\n* Woodblock prints were actually a collab between the artist, the wood carver, and the printer. In many cases only the artist and publisher were recognized on the final prints. It was usually the publisher who owned the woodblock, not the artist. Often the artist was considered a worker, contracted at the request of the publisher or patrons funding the project. Compare this to the NFT space, where ownership is carved onto the blockchain, and artists have freedom to create whatever they wish. \n\n* Copyminters.... Similar to the NFT world, fake publishers sprang up from time to time, who would reproduce famous prints. Enji Takamizawa was one such counterfeiter, who was able to skilfully produce woodblocks replicating originals down to the wood grain! \n\n* While fine-quality woodblock prints from the Edo era command huge auction prices today, they were in reality affordable art for the regular people of their time. NFTs are similar in this light, where we can enjoy pieces at home rather than say, visiting galleries or museums of unattainable art. \n\n\n\nAdditional querystring params (use when viewing in a separate window) \n\n* fullsize=true (33 megapixel output) \n* colourcorrect=false \n* grain=false \n* border=false \n\n\n\nLicenses included in source. Relying on: \n\n* PIXIJS for drawing \n* JSTS for geometry functions \n* chromajs for colour functions \n* noise and gaussian helpers from p5js ",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
