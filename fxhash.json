            "description": "Dencity is a generative art project inspired by aerial views of cities with a high density of buildings. Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "Every artist and collector feels the joy of both creating and collecting. But if I could share the joy of creating with collectors. And collectors with their family and friends, what may be an additive process of joy is now perhaps exponential. Joy to the power of 26 to be exact. \n\nIn this work I invite my friends and collectors to collaborate with me. Though not in coding, but together in a process of creating narratives and visuals. Code and story. We didn’t use github, just a simple p5.js editor to try out different programs and palettes. Pedrofe and J0rdan pick their palettes tastefully and carefully. okeoke, perhaps more of a genius than he lets on, picks his palettes blind. No hex color picker. Just straight up rhymes.  \n\nIn our discussions verbal language was forbidden. Only emojis were allowed to express our tastes and views. Each emojis put down on google doc was taken with absolutely seriousness. \n\nPedro: Loves to taking his daily walks on “Magic Mushroom Mountain”\n\nJ0rdan: Wonders about “Quark Question Quiches”\n\nOkeoke: Just get lost in “Finnegans’ Flower Fields.”\n\nIt has been a great joy to present our illustration book A24Z, 8 more than you know who. Each page expresses the alphabet with the best of our knowledge in semantics and sarcasm. Collect just 1 page, collect the alphabets that spell out your name, collect the whole A to Z. Read it to your children or loved ones. Though you might need to interpolate or extrapolate with great imagination which children all have. But most importantly, like all children, have fun!\n\nPress 1 to save png, only for Chrome, not Safari.

            "description": "Extrusion is a work that brings the generation of particles that perform smooth sinusoidal movements according to the evolution of the animation frames. Each frame registers its position with a slight shading, and with continuous stacking we get the impression of depth that I like to call 'pseudo-3D'.\nThe perception of movement is something that I really enjoy watching and I hope it can have the same effect on collectors and enthusiasts of animated arts. Even so, for those who prefer static art, the work is finished after a frame count (which may vary depending on its hash) by adding a grain texture followed by a thin black beveled frame with white passe-partout for better highlighting. the post-animation result.\n\nThe palette sets were carefully chosen, totaling 19 palettes with 6 colors each, separated into themes of environment, mood, styles, materials and other elements. Of these seven are monochromatic sets with a small rarity of being obtained.\n\nThe shapes of the particles vary between 8 pointed stars (rare), circles and vertical or horizontal bars and their trail changes a lot according to the frame count and total number of objects in the scene. Sometimes they look like they are dancing while moving around creating pseudo-three-dimensional objects.\n\nThe screens can be obtained in three different aspect ratios: 1x1 (square, more common), and two wide options (16x9 landscape and 9x16 portrait, a little rarer).\n\nAs already said and I always say: carefully chosen palettes!\n\n_______________________________\nVariety of editions is guaranteed by several features:\n* Black or white backgrounds (for better highlighting of particles);\n* 19 color palettes with 6 colors each where the rarest is BW (<6%)\n* 3 aspect ratios: 1x1 (50%), 9x16 (25%) and 16x9 (25%)\n* Controlled variety of scale;\n* Controlled variety of particle number;\n* Animation time;\n* Shape type: circles (60%), bars (30%) and stars (10%);\n* Animation with coordinated movement (12%);\n* Super rare inverted move (5%)\n* Ultra rare surprise feature.... (< 4%)\n\n_______________________________\nInteractive instructions:\n* Press [P] to play/pause your animation anytime you like (this increase exponentially your possibilities, right!?);\n* After pausing the animation, press [G] to finish your piece with grain and frame effect;\n* Press [I] to change the inverted mode, if you have it.\n\n_______________________________\nSaving your .png file:\n* Press [S] to save your canvas file;\n* Press [0] to save your file in qHD resolution;\n* Press [1] to save your file in FHD resolution;\n* Press [2] to save your file in UHD (4K) resolution;\n* Press [3] to save your file in FUHD (8K) resolution;\n(for higher resolutions, please wait up for few seconds until complete render)\n\n_______________________________\nCreator: Kukuti\nMay 2022\nLicense: NFT 2.0",

            "description": "While playing with trigonometric functions, I stumbled upon a set of parameters that could generate the sort of grid-shaped composition you can see in the artwork. Even more interesting to me, the cells in the grid resembled old CRT screens, and through those screens, I could see faraway galaxies, subatomic worlds, sometimes rooms or corridors, plants, analog signals from some mad experiment, ... and maybe you see something else.\n\nOr, as you can see in the animated construction, what you are seeing is just lines drawn on a vector field constructed with a sin \\* cos function (plus some amplitude and scaling). Your choice.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal artwork by Roberto Ranon aka Doble. Made between May and June 2022 using p5.js, canvas-sketch, and love.\n\nAll primary sales are automatically redirected to KT1DWnLiUkNtAQDErXxudFEH63JC6mqg3HEx, a donation smart contract built by FxHash & Versum that supports various ONGs that are helping the people of Ukraine.\n\nIn full screen, pressing Cmd + S or Ctrl + S will save an image of the artwork.\n",

After the roses are fully formed, a random mask of heavy ink is algorithmically screened over the flowers in a pattern of horizontal or vertical lines, occasionally fully flooding the painting. The accumulation of choices evokes graffiti or printmaking. The sequence of choices are interpreted by the computer according to the algorithm. The beauty of these choices are determined by the viewer.\n\nEach piece takes roughly 10 seconds to generate.\n\nArtist: @sarah_ridgley\nPress [s] to save the image\nJavaScript / p5js | script size: 11kb\n\n",

            "description": "\"Chaos Culture\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\n《西遊記》第一回:「混沌未分天地亂，茫茫渺渺無人見。」\n\nChaos Culture is the final chapter of this series. There is a legend in the East that before Pan Gu opened up the sky and created the earth, the world was a chaotic place, and no one knew its appearance. And I have always been fascinated by this mythical story since he was a child.\n\nThese three works have a father-son relationship, Research > Memory > Culture, with each work re-growing through the remnants of the previous work, depending on its image. From the beginning of the creative coding, I like the concept of recursion the most. Here I experiment with my central thinking through this iterative relationship so that the work is not only the shadow of the artist but also the pulling force of repetition.\n\n\"混沌\" Chaos in Eastern culture represents the initial state of things. This state is consistent with what we believe in generative art: Anything can happen if different forces are applied. Letting chaos grow out of order and then destroying it, the iterative process, is like my usual dialogue with myself, and maybe it's all just a diary.\n\nThrough these three series of works, whether I can eventually find everything in my childhood fantasy, I am not sure yet. The only thing I can be sure of is that I will continue to explore.\n\n- Click the mouse to save an artwork.\n- Collectors who own this NFT have the right to print the work.\n\nArtist: Aluan Wang (ileivoivm).\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "\"Herbarium\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022\n\nOccasionally, I stumble upon vintage scientific illustrations on various topics, exotically looking charts and graphs, alternative layouts for the periodic tables or psychological research diagrams, elaborate illustrations of botany and zoology, minerals, and natural and sometimes unnatural phenomena. Most of those illustrations are part of the \"art and science\" practices from the 18th and 19th centuries. At the core of those practices were observation and interpretation, unraveling complexity through visualizing abstract ideas or finding a creative approach for understanding previously incomprehensible forms. \n\nI'm an admirer of two female pioneers in the field. Maria Sibylla Merian created, with immense dedication, a book with intricate illustrations of plants and insects, later praised by scientists. On the other hand, Anna Atkins published a book with beautiful botanical cyanotypes, considered the first book with photographic images. These topics are the visual inspiration for pieces presented at ArtBasel HK. \n\nMy mathematical background makes me naturally attracted to graphs, converting numbers to curves, and everything schematically displayed. Also, combining scientific symbols and illustrations with imaginary data inspires the spectator to find meaning in unrelated or random things or provokes latent skepticism towards assumed concepts of truth, reality, and knowledge.

            "description": "'Tesseract' is a generative collection drawing on the concept of the cube from oneirology, the interpretation of dreams. In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",
