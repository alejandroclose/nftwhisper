            "description": "Organic Illusion is one of the very first computer graphic drawings I produced that I considered worthy of being called Art. This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory. Like a child you never forget. I submit to you again in new media for you all to enjoy.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "At the heart of the borders of imagination stands my creation, \"Fata Morgana.\" \nThis abstract work is a bold exploration of the boundaries between reality and dream, a subtle dance between dimensions of perception. \nI forged this vision by giving life to a structure that eludes the human eye like a mirage in a scorching desert.\n\nFrom a distance, this creation draws the observer into a world that merges and blends with reality. The structures emerge as promises of urban architecture, but as they approach, they crumble into patterns of light and color.\n\nColors harmoniously dance, gently fading through ethereal shades. The forms themselves seem to reject definition, refusing to adhere to the laws of perspective and geometry.\n\nThe backdrop of this illusory city is a palette of chromatic emotions. Here, the boundary between the real and unreal completely dissolves, and one finds themselves wandering in a limbo of perceptions, suspended between certainty and wonder.\n\nThe artwork is an invitation to explore the unknown, a celebration of the art of illusion. It is a place where the rules of physics give way to the uninterrupted dance of creativity. In this abstract vision, I hope that everyone can find their own interpretation, a personal meaning that reveals itself like a secret guarded among the nuances of light and shadow.\n\nTo change the density from 1 to 5 (incorrect results set to 1), double-click the left mouse button,\npress S to delete background.\n\nI used p5.min.js - p5.sound.js.",

            "description": "Organic Illusion is one of the very first computer graphic drawings I produced that I considered worthy of being called Art. This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory. Like a child you never forget. I submit to you again in new media for you all to enjoy.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Organic Illusion is one of the very first computer graphic drawings I produced that I considered worthy of being called Art. This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory. Like a child you never forget. I submit to you again in new media for you all to enjoy.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Organic Illusion is one of the very first computer graphic drawings I produced that I considered worthy of being called Art. This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory. Like a child you never forget. I submit to you again in new media for you all to enjoy.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "At the heart of the borders of imagination stands my creation, \"Fata Morgana.\" \nThis abstract work is a bold exploration of the boundaries between reality and dream, a subtle dance between dimensions of perception. \nI forged this vision by giving life to a structure that eludes the human eye like a mirage in a scorching desert.\n\nFrom a distance, this creation draws the observer into a world that merges and blends with reality. The structures emerge as promises of urban architecture, but as they approach, they crumble into patterns of light and color.\n\nColors harmoniously dance, gently fading through ethereal shades. The forms themselves seem to reject definition, refusing to adhere to the laws of perspective and geometry.\n\nThe backdrop of this illusory city is a palette of chromatic emotions. Here, the boundary between the real and unreal completely dissolves, and one finds themselves wandering in a limbo of perceptions, suspended between certainty and wonder.\n\nThe artwork is an invitation to explore the unknown, a celebration of the art of illusion. It is a place where the rules of physics give way to the uninterrupted dance of creativity. In this abstract vision, I hope that everyone can find their own interpretation, a personal meaning that reveals itself like a secret guarded among the nuances of light and shadow.\n\nTo change the density from 1 to 5 (incorrect results set to 1), double-click the left mouse button,\npress S to delete background.\n\nI used p5.min.js - p5.sound.js.",
