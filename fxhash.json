            "description": "Instructures explores the endless and diverse outcomes when a minimal and straightforward set of instructions are followed to build structures out of cubes. Between 4 and 8 instructions are selected and used to generate a unique structure for each edition. The available instructions are “stack”, “pile”, “plane” and “sculpt”. As a last step, flat and/or rounded corner details are optionally added to each structure.\n\nEach artwork includes the set of instructions that were followed to build the structure. These instructions can be followed to build new structures using other methods in addition to programming, e.g. sculpting, printing, drawing, painting etc., and I plan on using this body of work to do exactly that. This project is, in fact, the result of an algorithm initially developed to generate interesting compositions and structures out of cubes to be used as points of departure for drawings, prints and paintings.\n\nEven though the algorithm is focused on generating unique structures, the additional variations in scale, composition, colour, viewing angle and drawing style create an even wider array of generative outcomes. Some outputs are recognisable as three-dimensional orthographic drawings while others are more abstract. Instructures attempts to strike a balance between traditional art and the more technical nature of computer and blockchain art by blending visual cues from both disciplines. My hope is that the works can be appreciated by audiences from both of these worlds.\n\n“The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.” — Sol Lewitt\n\nHotkeys\n=======\nEach artwork is interactive allowing the viewer to rotate, move and zoom in on the structure.\n\n[H]elp — Complete list of available hotkeys\n[I]nstructions – Instructions for structure\n[F]eatures\n[P]rint sizes\n[Right click, save] – Save PNG image\n\n[Z]oom\n[W] Move up\n[S] Move down\n[A] Move left\n[D] Move right\n[<] Rotate clockwise\n[>] Rotate anti-clockwise\n\nOriginal artwork by Herman Pretorius, 2022",

            "description": "Instructures explores the endless and diverse outcomes when a minimal and straightforward set of instructions are followed to build structures out of cubes. Between 4 and 8 instructions are selected and used to generate a unique structure for each edition. The available instructions are “stack”, “pile”, “plane” and “sculpt”. As a last step, flat and/or rounded corner details are optionally added to each structure.\n\nEach artwork includes the set of instructions that were followed to build the structure. These instructions can be followed to build new structures using other methods in addition to programming, e.g. sculpting, printing, drawing, painting etc., and I plan on using this body of work to do exactly that. This project is, in fact, the result of an algorithm initially developed to generate interesting compositions and structures out of cubes to be used as points of departure for drawings, prints and paintings.\n\nEven though the algorithm is focused on generating unique structures, the additional variations in scale, composition, colour, viewing angle and drawing style create an even wider array of generative outcomes. Some outputs are recognisable as three-dimensional orthographic drawings while others are more abstract. Instructures attempts to strike a balance between traditional art and the more technical nature of computer and blockchain art by blending visual cues from both disciplines. My hope is that the works can be appreciated by audiences from both of these worlds.\n\n“The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.” — Sol Lewitt\n\nHotkeys\n=======\nEach artwork is interactive allowing the viewer to rotate, move and zoom in on the structure.\n\n[H]elp — Complete list of available hotkeys\n[I]nstructions – Instructions for structure\n[F]eatures\n[P]rint sizes\n[Right click, save] – Save PNG image\n\n[Z]oom\n[W] Move up\n[S] Move down\n[A] Move left\n[D] Move right\n[<] Rotate clockwise\n[>] Rotate anti-clockwise\n\nOriginal artwork by Herman Pretorius, 2022",

            "description": "Each monogrid artwork gets initialized with a start up algorithm that builds up a set of rectangles and fills them with pixels. There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

Each graphical trait in the artwork is controlled by this origin, so in essence the transaction hash is responsible for the entire artwork.\n\nWhile most generative artworks hide their transaction hash in abstraction, Hash Effects shows it front and center. Each unique artwork celebrates its own transaction hash as a graphical element that morphs into various shapes over different animation scenes.",

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.
