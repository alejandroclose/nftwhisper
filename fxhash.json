            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

On the contrary, it is created to give the viewer the opportunity to stop thinking and devote some time to their feelings. Visually, it consists of color fields created with the help of code, which change their position on the screen and flow into each other in their own rhythm. Their forms are completely abstract, and the colors are contrasting. They capture and relax the attention of the viewer,        communicating with the unconscious.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, the project is webgl shaders, which use trigonometric functions and parameters passed from javascript for the creation of color fields and mixing it in a feedback loop with previous frames. The project doesn't use any third party code, libraries or external dependencies. This work includes 11 different composition mods, each of them variable in terms of the shape and arrangement of colors on the screen and has different transitions between color channels and color states. Before being rendered to the screen, the image passes through a feedback filter, which also has several settings for light channels and data processing speed. This all creates a wide variety of possible iterations.\n\nControls:\n\np - pause mode;\n[] - moving frames in a pause mode;\ni/rclick - day/night mode switch;\nd - description;  \ns - save the image;\n2-5 - change canvas resolution;\n\nThe artwork is created by MCHX and llai.59.\n",

If the piece is too dark, reduce the render length or increase the stroke weight. If the piece seems too light, alter the volatility of the noise, or slow it down with increased friction. Each parameter can, of course, be explained in great detail, but in reality the best way to work with the piece is to play.\n\nThe random numbers for the piece are generated using the minter's address, meaning that what you see as a live preview will be the exact mint received.",

What will it dream for you?\n\nThis NFT runs a fully embedded AI. A tiny diffusion model trained from images of the universe is used to hallucinate a 64x64 image. The image is upscaled using a GAN network to produce a 1024x1024 high res image. The image may be overlayed with a color in various blending modes to produce further contrast and diversity in the output. All AI models are run locally in the web browser.\n\nPress \"s\" when rendering is fully complete to download the high res image.",

BETTER enjoy it on fullscreen.\nCAUTION: features will adjust to screen size.\n- press 's' to save an image.\n- click mouse to stop animation.\n- double-click to restart animation.\n\nmade with p5js and love\nmekhno / Marc L Clapers",

When projected onto a two-dimensional canvas, it generates a series of intricate patterns reminiscent of abstract paintings. \n\nThe main parameter is the seed, which the shader uses to calculate internal hashes in the GLSL code, resulting in a variety of patterns. Up to four layers of each fractal can be stacked, and the rotation of coordinates for each layer can be controlled. \n\nOther adjustable features include stroke intensity, color saturation, an inverted color mode, and a texture composed of lines that distort the patterns. The frequency and distortion factor of the lines can be adjusted as well.\n\nRendering can be slow on low-end GPUs, and it's not suitable for mobile devices.",
