Or, you may not see anything. Instead, you can just enjoy things falling into place.\n\nGet a pack of shattered glass, snow, or ice*, uncovering a pattern. Or an axis of dancing geometries. Enter the Garden of Symmetry.\n\nThe graphic is a plottable SVG file in A3 format, ready to be drawn using a pen plotter.

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

Suddenly the daughter got sick and died like a collapsing star. God gets alone, angry, depressed and finally mad. He turned all the universe to ash and mixed the ash of her daughter's soul with it to make her alive, But he failed. In the end, he decided to destroy himself to make a New cosmos of all generative planets from ash of himself and his daughter's soul to one more time in the eternity they can be with each other in a heart of a planet.

You can see more random variations from fxhash page.\n◼ The beauty and complexity of the Planet's surface is important, But what is going on inside?\nEach planet has three grades of volume (High, Medium, Low) that show you what resources exist on the planets (Common, Rare, Legendary).\nSome resources are so valuable and infrequent.\n◼ For Example: It's possible to get Oxygen (Legendary Resource) on Low volume slot, but it's infrequent if you get it on High volume slot.\n◼ Checkout Material rarity list on webpage.\n\n📎 Webpage address: HashProtocol.tez.page\n\n⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛\n\n🔵〰Social〰🔵\n\n◼ Participant in events or get achievements to win some prizes.\nSo it's significant to see you on the discord server.
