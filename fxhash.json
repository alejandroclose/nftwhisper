            "description": "🔥 BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY \"open edition\" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",

            "description": "\"◉◉◉\" presents a collection of pointillistic drawings generated by p5js. However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.\n\"◉◉◉\" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.\n\nThe technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file.

All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM.
