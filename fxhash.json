            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px).

It starts with a collection of analog photographs, shot on film and scanned that were later used as a training dataset in Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training. This way, A.I. learns the main characteristics of film photography. In particular, it mimics its recognizable grain. Another type of pixel grain is added with the use of code and pixel shifting as well as digital manipulation. Finally, the last type of “grain” appears with the use of generative text where a different kind of A.I. was given a short description of the project and instructed to imagine the rest of the story. The fragmented and void of meaning parts of generative text are added to the images as one of the possible traits.",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

            "description": "White Mountain Winter is collaboration between myself and the machine to describe scenes that are real, or were. Yet perhaps now foreign, or out of time, or far away. I provide the seed of a dream I remember, and trust the machine to help make it real again.\n\nI grew up in a town much like some of these, homes dispersed throughout the valley beneath the shadows of the mountains rising around. This is a tribute to the memory of wintertime in that place; bleak, cold, grey, with the light seemingly always fading. Yet at the same time, the feeling of calm, solace, peace resonating through. Exposed to the mountain elements, yet protected by them. A delicate arrangement, but essential.\n\nThe seed of magic I remember is present in the experience of falling snow at dusk. Large flakes tumbling down and blanketing everything, no end in sight. The most striking thing is the silence. The fallen snow absorbing all distraction, insisting that your focus be sharpened to a singularity; right there, right then.\n\n---\n- Best rendered in Chrome browser (best performance, & canvas blur - please be patient :)\n- Made with p5js\n- Press \"s\" to save png",

Ghostly plants and flowers grow around an invisible point, but they immediately begin to fade into the dark background and are soon replaced and covered by others. This process of accumulation and disappearance builds an ever-changing floral garland, or perhaps a funeral wreath.\n\nThe monochrome vegetation is part of a fictional flora, born out of random algorithmic combinations, and does not intend to reproduce any real species. It belongs to an “artificial nature” which, like so many worlds that the computers generate for us in movies, games, and virtual reality environments, is a convincing simulation of life, but it is not actually living. AI bots, virtual assistants and non-player characters are also representatives of the uncanny realm of the not-really-alive-but-looking-like-it, which are becoming an increasingly relevant presence in our everyday lives.\n\nThese plants and flowers speak about life as a process of incessant renovation, but also about death as the background that’s always there and makes life possible. This spectral vegetation seems to thrive precisely at the verge between both worlds.\n_______________\n\n\nThis work is animated and will adapt to any screen size.

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

            "description": "*\\_../*`¬-’\\/*`¬’’¬`*\\/’-¬`*\\.._/*\n\nNature, nature, evolving might… Silent inventor, always right.\nWhere is the edge of nature and where do we begin?  \nWhat is of nature and what is of man? \nIsn't everything made by nature's hands?\n\nTo know more about the concept and technicalities of this piece, see the fxtext article “The spectrum of nature - a short making of”. Link at the bottom. If you’d rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",
