            "description": "An “algorhythmic” exploration of the oral/aural tradition in poetry. \n\n“Zero is a time of night.\nZero is the color of snow.\nZero is the space between notes.\nZero is the silence between words.\nZero is the pause before breath.\nZero is void in the heart of a crowd.\nZero is not nothing, but it’s not everything.\nOne is a time of day.\nOne is the color of spring grass in sunlight.\nOne is the warmth at the back of my neck when I turn to find you standing there.\nOne is the rhythm at the base of my spine.\nOne is the peace at the core of my being.\nOne is the sound of your voice in the dark.\nAnd one more thing:\nWithout one I am nothing…”\n–Technelegy \n \n\nFusing AI-powered verse, spoken word, original music and visuals all in generative composition, this playful ode to our universal language is inspired by Stiles’ binary-based art and Stern’s performative poetics. The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature. Brought into existence via the blockchain, it is a new form of “token word poetry.”\n\n\nAs with the duo’s other poetry “unreadings,” all minters will receive an airdropped broadside of the full poem after all editions are collected. A 1/1 media-rich version of the entire poem will also be made available. \n \nPoetic traits:\n- 321 editions performed by the algorithm, out of billions of possible combinations\n- Each unique piece contains between 3 and 6 (out of 60) lines of generative text from a poem by Technelegy – a custom text generator fine-tuned on Stiles’ writing and research material, seeded with prompts from Stiles’ and Stern’s work – translated into binary and performed by Stiles\n- 24 possible binary backbeats performed by Stern in his “Nathaniel Fun Time” (NFT) stylings, and generatively re-mixed\n- 98 possible intros\n- 15 musical stems composed by Kris Bones, generating millions of possible mixes\n- Thousands of possible ending combinations \n- 5 fonts, layered in billions of potential ways, including Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer”\n- 13 color palettes based on Stern and Stiles’ respective artworka\n- Very rare attributes including music-less performance, poem-less music, repeated “B1nary 0de” (title only)\n\nClick to start and stop or replay. Although the first play through will be the same every time, starting and stopping may create minor variations in your mix (though not any of the core attributes).\n\n0RAL B1NARY: “BINARY ODE” was produced with partial support from Refraction DAO’s Creative Grants program, and premiered as part of Refraction Festival at Art Basel Miami 2022. 15% of primary sales go to Refraction, and 5% of primary sales will be donated to Black Girls Code.\n",

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

            "description": "by Daeinc\nAug 2022\n\nDuet explores generative+computational motion and creates an almost infinite sequence of visual compositions. Two groups of shapes transform, merge, and split randomly. What can be disorienting starts to make sense as every element is animated from one to the other. This transition animation is what connects random pieces and creates a relationship between them. Each element is mathematically interpolated, with its motion defined by an equation. \n\nAlthough there are key moments, it is hard to summarize time-based work as a static image. As a constantly evolving generative motion piece, Duet invites viewers to form their impression by feeling the rhythm over time.\n\n## Guide:\n- The animation responds to window aspect ratio. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- For reliable playback, keep the window active and use IPFS view.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.5.1 with Chromium 104.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction\n- [n] to play a new random loop.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause.\n- [s] to save PNG. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [up] and [down] to change shape resolution.\n- [left] and [right] to change BPM. only works while looping. \n- [h] to toggle high DPI mode. off by default.\n- [p] to toggle pixel snapping. off by default.\n\n## URL Parameters\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&w=1200&h=600\n- [w] and [h]: set width and height in pixels. (ex. w=1200&h=600)\n- [s] and [e]: set starting and ending keyframes (inclusive) for loop. (ex. s=20&e=24) \n- setting large values for start/end is not advised.\n- [len]: instead of start/end, set a loop length between 1 and 16. (ex. len=4)\n- [bpm]: beats per minute. (ex. bpm=80)\n- [res]: shape resolution between 0 and 18. (ex. res=2)\n- [pr]: pixel ratio. set it to 2 (or press [h]) for hi-DPI screens.\n- [ar]: maximum aspect ratio. set to any value over 1. 1.2 by default.\n- [snap]: add the param to snap to pixel grid.\n\n## License\nCC BY-NC 4.0\nPlease refer to the included LICENSE.md for license information.\nLibraries used: canvas-sketch, canvas-sketch-util, dom-events, hsv2rgb, keyframes, equations from easings.net, array shuffle from stackoverflow.",

January 2022\nEdition of 512\n\nGrowth v02 is an generative exploration of patterns in the style of William Morris' iconic wallpaper designs from the 1800s. The code for the Growth series was originally designed to create plausible road networks but has been rewritten to create more organic curved forms. Created with p5js.\n\n'space' to pause the simulation\n'h' to toggle to higher res (increases canvas size but runs slower: great for screengrabs)\n'r' to reset the seed (some features are locked to the original hash)\n's' to save an image to disk\nAll generated patterns are tile-able horizontally and vertically.\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\nThis project relies heavily on randomly generated values. It has been thoroughly tested. However, there is always the chance that the wrong combination of randomness can create less-compelling growth.

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

            "description": "by Daeinc\nAug 2022\n\nDuet explores generative+computational motion and creates an almost infinite sequence of visual compositions. Two groups of shapes transform, merge, and split randomly. What can be disorienting starts to make sense as every element is animated from one to the other. This transition animation is what connects random pieces and creates a relationship between them. Each element is mathematically interpolated, with its motion defined by an equation. \n\nAlthough there are key moments, it is hard to summarize time-based work as a static image. As a constantly evolving generative motion piece, Duet invites viewers to form their impression by feeling the rhythm over time.\n\n## Guide:\n- The animation responds to window aspect ratio. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- For reliable playback, keep the window active and use IPFS view.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.5.1 with Chromium 104.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction\n- [n] to play a new random loop.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause.\n- [s] to save PNG. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [up] and [down] to change shape resolution.\n- [left] and [right] to change BPM. only works while looping. \n- [h] to toggle high DPI mode. off by default.\n- [p] to toggle pixel snapping. off by default.\n\n## URL Parameters\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&w=1200&h=600\n- [w] and [h]: set width and height in pixels. (ex. w=1200&h=600)\n- [s] and [e]: set starting and ending keyframes (inclusive) for loop. (ex. s=20&e=24) \n- setting large values for start/end is not advised.\n- [len]: instead of start/end, set a loop length between 1 and 16. (ex. len=4)\n- [bpm]: beats per minute. (ex. bpm=80)\n- [res]: shape resolution between 0 and 18. (ex. res=2)\n- [pr]: pixel ratio. set it to 2 (or press [h]) for hi-DPI screens.\n- [ar]: maximum aspect ratio. set to any value over 1. 1.2 by default.\n- [snap]: add the param to snap to pixel grid.\n\n## License\nCC BY-NC 4.0\nPlease refer to the included LICENSE.md for license information.\nLibraries used: canvas-sketch, canvas-sketch-util, dom-events, hsv2rgb, keyframes, equations from easings.net, array shuffle from stackoverflow.",
