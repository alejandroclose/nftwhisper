(Up to 1min)\nCode was written in typescript.\nThe only used libraries were chroma.js and simplex-noise",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "\"A mille-feuille (French pronunciation: ​[mil fœj], \"thousand-sheets\"), also known by the names Napoleon, vanilla slice, and custard slice, is a dessert made of puff pastry layered with pastry cream. Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.\n\nTraditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry (pâte feuilletée), alternating with two layers of pastry cream (crème pâtissière). The top pastry layer is finished in various ways: sometimes it is topped with whipped cream, or it may be dusted with icing sugar, cocoa, pastry crumbs, or sliced almonds. It may also be glazed with icing or fondant alone, or in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) or other colored icing stripes, and combed to create a marbled effect.\" — Wikipedia\n\nPrints available upon request: prints@stefancontiero.com\nBest enjoyed on browsers supporting Display-P3 color gamut.\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n@stefan_contiero\n",

The sense of regularity strengthens and we feel it swelling towards a singularity. Heeere weeee goooo… BAM! Then off again marching back into chaos to repeat the cycle.\n\nProposed by cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter in his 1979 book “Gödel, Escher, Bach”, and further developed in his 2007 book “I Am a Strange Loop”, “Strange Loops” are Hofstadter’s attempt at explaining the mechanisms that give rise to the sensation of “I” - through hierarchical, self-referential, and at times seemingly paradoxical feedback-loops of abstraction and causality. \n\n—\n\n“Who shoves whom around in the tangled megaganglion that is your brain, and who shoves whom around in ‘this teetering bulb of dread and dream’ that is mine?”\n\n“Do dreads and dreams, hopes and griefs, ideas and beliefs, interests and doubts, infatuations and envies, memories and ambitions, bouts of nostalgia and floods of empathy, flashes of guilt and sparks of genius, play any role in the world of physical objects? Do such pure abstractions have causal powers? Can they shove massive things around, or are they just impotent fictions?” \n\n\"In the end, we are self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages that are little miracles of self-reference. [...] Poised midway between the unvisualizable cosmic vastness of curved spacetime and the dubious, shadowy flickerings of charged quanta, we human beings, more like rainbows and mirages than like raindrops or boulders, are unpredictable self-writing poems — vague, metaphorical, ambiguous, and sometimes exceedingly beautiful.”\n\n- Douglas Hofstadter, “I Am a Strange Loop”, 2007\n\n–-\n\nMemo Akten \nƈօʍքʊtǟtɨօռǟʟ Aʀȶɨֆȶ; AI wrangler; curious philomath; PhD in Creative Artificial Intelligence with Meaningful Human Control; works with code to create images, sounds, films, large-scale responsive installations and performances; fascinated by trying to understand the nature of nature and the human condition.\n\nJames Paterson \nSynthesizing drawing, animation, sculpture and code under the moniker Presstube since 1999.

            "description": "\"The images is not a closed field of knowledge; it is a whirling, centrifugal field. It is not a fiedl of knowledge like any other; it is a movement demanding all the anthropogical aspects of being and time\" Didi-Huberman\n\nContinuing in the experimentation of photography and generative art.\n\nWhat's left of what's left ... Seeks to take the reflection beyond the simple superimposition of images, highlighting the \"human\" x \"machine\" interaction.\n\nThe areas of light, fog and shadows present us with image clippings in a large tangle of visual reflections.\n\nThe algorithm builds unique images from the combination of different layers, according to a bank of photographs extracted from my own collection. In total, there are six layers containing 10 photographs each, in addition to a base layer containing 20 photos of urban fragments.\n\nIn addition, the code implements, in a random and semi-autonomous way, some adaptations such as masking, colorization, rotation and blending modes for specific layers.\n\n* Features\nPlace - Where have i been. 20 distinct urban fragments;\nMode - “Color” 80% or “B&W” 20%;\nZone - “Amazon” 25%; “Mist” and “Terracotta” 20%, “Old Sky” 15%; and “Ocher” and “Golden” 10%.\nInvert - 2.5%\n\n\"In a sense of overlapping past/future, not as an idea of ​​current time, but as places of memory dispute. This \"non-place\", traversed by layers, is solidified in the images, almost like a truce from the endless war of this inconstancy.\nthere is no winner\" Raffa Gomes\n\nGenerative Token by of Morbeck for fxhash\n\naugust 21, 2022",

The role of lines is such that sometimes they help the dynamics of the composition and sometimes they appear in the form of texture and its contrast with empty spaces leads to the visual richness of the work. I avoided drawing various visual elements in favor of clarity of composition. Also, in order to avoid exaggeration, I used colors sparingly because I think they will have a stronger impact in their occasional presence.\n\nCreated using p5.js.",

Auction will stop changing price when non-reserves are fully minted.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nNature’s wild flourish and untamed growth wondrously represent the exacting function of beauty — a function that is at once useful and infinitely creative. Perhaps nowhere is this delicate symbiosis better observed than in the flower, wherein a pure balance of physical fundamentals exists beneath ornate patterns and elaborate aesthetics.\n\nAmongst the layers of undulating, vividly colored petals, attention-grabbing stigma and stamen, and lusciously decorative features, nature’s organic abundance and disorder disguises its masterful propensity for precision. Each of the flower’s components evolve through unpredictable interactions with an unwieldy natural environment, creating spectacular adaptations that emerge from the tension between what attracts.\n\nRococo painters appreciated the organic fluidity found in flowers and vegetal forms, using their joyful abundance to depict a break from the rigid and stoic period the artists hoped to leave behind. They sought to reframe perfection away from predictability and toward compositions as surprising as the natural world around them.\n\nThus, ‘Rococo’ is a generative distortion of an old tradition: a digital painting created entirely with code that interprets and processes the natural world’s dichotomies. This painting algorithm builds upon natural structures while melding and moving their colors beyond form, growing randomly organic iterations that are as perfect as they are imperfect.\n\nCreated by Ori Ben-Shabat & Ronen Tanchum @Phenomenalabs\nCreative contributions from Tender @tender_art\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTechnical Details:\n\n- Mobile/GPU Intensive\n- Press “s” to save a .png of the artwork in live view\n- Press “p” to render a high res output + press “s” to save a printable .png",
