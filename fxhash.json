            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "Chromoplasms have 10 features which approximately describe their configuration, behavior and appearance. Like their predecessors monocells, they start from a basic primitive shape and develop in several stages through application of growth rules. Highest stage observed for a chromoplasm is 4, which is also GPU intensive to display and interact with. Each chromoplasm has both structural as well as behavioral features. Structural ones include starting primitive, stage (1-4) and order (symmetric / irregular), with many growth-related features remaining hidden. Behavioral features include reconfiguration of node connections, modulation of node distances and degeneration type. Occasionally, nodes change size in oscillating patterns. Around 300 color palettes are grouped in 8 categories.\n\nPress o_o for recording an animation clip (available only in fullscreen / live mode).

It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "“monuMOments” was inspired by the work of visual artist Penelope Umbrico, seeking a reflection on the era of techno fossils and on the relationship of human beings with technology and the environment as a whole, whether manufactured or natural.  See more in \n\n“Penelope Umbrico's MONUMENT explores the monolithic state of current technologies in relation to their obsolescence. Umbrico begins with the idea that all technologies - including the electronics we use at home and in the workplace - are in effect “black boxes” whose contents are largely incomprehensible to end users. Although we tend to think of screens as invisible and we never see the workings of our technologies, almost everything we learn and know these days is mediated through the filters of technology. Umbrico aims to demystify the black-box device and to engage the public in creative modes of transforming and visualizing the electronic detritus that accumulates in our homes and in landfills.” (https://www.bricartsmedia.org).\n\nThe algorithm initially simulates the static noise of old televisions and from there on, several elements and layers follow one another that, through different blending modes, colors, lights and shadows, shape the final image.\n\nAbout the ultra rare feature, CASTING OUT NINES refers to the work of the same name done in 2020 that deals with the largest environmental crime in terms of extension that is known in the country, where hundreds of tons of crude oil were spilled on the coast of northeast Brazil.\nEach of the nine photographs in the work represent one of the states reached, where a specific color was superimposed.\n\nThe colors superimposed on each of the images appeared by chance, or not so much, and were constructed from temporal data and the location of the appearance of the spots on Brazilian beaches. In the RGB palette of “oil” tones, the value of “R” came from the sum of the tens contained in the date of the first oil record in each of the states, as well as the values of “G” and “B” came from the sum of the numbers contained in the geographic coordinates of latitude and longitude, respectively, of the affected locations.\n\n#Main Features\n\n- 16 color schemes “zones”;\n* CASTING OUT NINES – 1,5% chance\n* NO SIGNAL – 2% chance\n* WOODCUT – 3% chance\n* GREY SCALE – 3,5% chance\n* TAGs | GOLDEN, SILVER, BRONZE and BLOOD – 4% chance each\n* SHAKE + - 6% chance\n* SHAKE - - 8% chance\n* FRAQUENCIES | 9hz, 10hz, 11hz, 12hz, 13hz and 14hz – 10% chance each\n  \n- 3 canvas formats;\n- 4 rotation frequency;\n- 3 degrees of granulometry;\n\n#Royalties split: 30% for minters.\n\nClaimmable physical print: Minters of the ultra rare feature will receive an edition of the book AUGUST TIDE and a collection of 9 exclusive prints (20x12 cm each), numbered and signed, about CASTING OUT NINES.\n \nThe book and the prints can be claimed by DM on Twitter @morbeck_art or by email contato@mateusmorbeck.com\n\nOther interested parties may purchase separately the book or a printed and signed version of their edition.\n\nJune 04, 2022\n\nGenerative Token by Morbeck for fxhash.",

By dropping the plotter drawing constraint, new perspectives for exploration appeared.\nThis is how these cells began to intertwine, live together, mutate and change color, like an evolving system.\n\nWhat surprises me the most in this new series, is the stories appearing behind each new composition. See how these abstracts shapes can come to life and narrate us things through our imagination.\n\nEach color palette takes us into a different world, drawing a very specific atmosphere.\n\nAs me, let yourself be carried away by these stories 💫 !\n\nArtwork by Julien_Espagnon, 2022.\n\nControl : Press « S » to save the image as a PNG.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

This journey is life and, if you're fortunate, the majority of your journey is good and you eventually meet your Gods knowing that you've lived well.\n\nReisiger means Traveler in Afrikaans, and this work is meant to portray the hope, joy and diversity of our travail through life.\n\nThis piece assembles a simple mesh along a bezier spline of an orbital path around a series of bodies. It uses Newtonian gravity - adequately mangled to make it more interesting - and applies a number of transformations in flight. Hatching and occlusion algorithms are custom, but are developed based on work by Reinder Nijhoff. \n\nThis is a plotter artwork and is intended to be enjoyed both on screen and in print. When printing, choose your pens appropriately - gel pens for dark paper etc, all colours are meant as a suggestion and all versions should look just fine in monochrome if you so choose. If you want an upscaled raster artwork (for regular printing) just add a dpr param to the URL like &dpr=10.\n\nLeft-click to download a PNG.\nDouble-click to download an SVG file ready for plotting.\n\nLicensing: BY-NC-ND see license.md for details.",

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

Some paths are filled with love, others, with blues. \nWe grow up, and we broaden our paths, or narrow them. \n\nOr, you can think of this piece as just a bunch of lines, grown progressively using a process similar to Substrate (Jared Tarbell, 2003), modified with a vector field generated with trigonometric functions. \n\nRandom features include the color palette, the number of lines, their width, the scaling of the vector field, and margins.\n\nSome color palettes were inspired by the beautiful plotter works of Iskra Velitchkova.\n\nOriginal artwork by Roberto Ranon aka Dobleganger aka Doble · Made with p5.js · Udine, 2021",

            "description": "Fabula (lat.) is a chronologically sequential representation of events and adventures in a work of art; canvas, a scheme of development of life events, presented in a sequential order.\n\nAs in \"Secrets\" and \"Melancholia\", in this work I continue to explore the psychological diversity of people and their feelings, using colors and abstract shapes.\n\nJust a few of my actions from the past define the overall picture of my life. These are important events in a certain sequence, my achievements and mistakes, which most significantly affected where I am now. There are only a few of them, but their influence on my present and my future is enormous. I would like to change some of my actions, but it is already too late - the decisions have been made, the roads to my future have been paved, the plot of my story has been formed, the picture of my life has been drawn. The only thing left for me is to believe that I will still be able to add a few good touches to the canvas. In this work, the placement of figures on the canvas demonstrates the influence of one or another of my actions on my entire life, and the colors indicate its psychological evaluation. Probably, the same can be said about every person. Each of us creates our own fabula and paints our own picture, the colors and shapes of which sometimes make up a very harmonious overall image, regardless of what meaning it carries, positive or negative. And this strange harmony can become a separate topic for an interesting discussion, because it can be the key to proper self-awareness and self-perception.\n\nTechnically, we have a simple Voronoi algorithm with my own metric. No predefined shapes like lines, curves or circles are used here. 3-14 points (X,Y-coordinates, in the console) are randomly fixed on the canvas => these are the vertices of the diagram, around which, according to the metric, unique Voronoi cells are sequentially formed pixel by pixel, each of which has its own shape and color. The number of important human actions corresponds to the number of colors and vertices of the Voronoi diagram. Also, note that the borders of the cells are specially blurred (clearly visible if you zoom in), because each of the colors (actions) can potentially displace part of the others, increasing its impact on the overall picture. After all, the past does not just weigh on us, it largely determines our future.\n\nPress \"S\" to save PNG (4000x5200px).\n\nKyiv, 01.2023",
