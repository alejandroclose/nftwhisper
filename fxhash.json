            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background. Contact me for a white background version of your iteration.",

            "description": "1 of 5 in CENTURY-XXX, Series 2\nEdition of 1000\n\nTribute to Herbert W. Franke\n“In Honor of the Dinosaur of Computer Art” \n\nHerbert W. Franke, a pioneer of computer art, passed away on July 16, 2022 at the age of 95. CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE is an homage to Franke’s MONDRIAN software developed for the Texas Instruments TI 99/4 home computer in 1979, and it’s a fundraiser to digitize his archive:\n\n“Our goal is to raise 20,000 Euro so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. If we raise more money, it will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.” \n\nEach frame, a single “pixel” is added to the CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE image. When the software first loads, 100,000 frames are run in the background to start things off. Keep it running for hours or days to see it transform entirely — it’s an “infinite animation.”",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "Everything is divisible. Larger organisms are made up of smaller ones, entire galaxies are comprised of stars, planets, people, dust, and one effect here and now ripples into eternity. Nothing exists without the elemental components that have evolved to make them possible — and nothing on the plane of existence arrives in isolation from something greater. This enmeshed reality is the concept of a Holon: a whole that is simultaneously part of another whole. \n\nAs cells, energies, beings, and ideas grow in complexity, each new advancement includes and transcends their holons, the very catalysts of evolution. What does this essential process look like on its own when scale, context, and definition are removed? The senses are forced to purely observe the present interactions and reactions that occur between all parts. This is what Holons attempts to portray — the witnessing of birth, formation, and crystallization simultaneously. \n\nUpon viewing each piece and inspecting its detail with curiosity — we can observe living reality that has been temporarily suspended from motion and artificially stopped for us to witness. Can we see what is a part, and what is a whole? Can we define what these holons are? \n\nLet each Holons remind us that the impossible can always be made; let each one be nothing and everything — organisms, cosmos, energy itself — all at once, for it’s the creation of something entirely new that best reminds us that everything is actually made of the parts already here. So, remember to create without barriers or limitations because reality itself is made of that which lives now only in imagination.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x flight404\nOctober 2022\n\nPress ‘h’ in live view to render a high resolution version of any token.\nPress ‘s’ in live view to save a .png of the current view of any token.\n\nHolons was created in vanilla Javascript and WebGL, but the majority of the work was done in GLSL shaders. This setup was substantially assisted by fx(hash) community leader and artist Liam Egan who provided technical assistance and emotional support during the project's lifespan. For this reason, we have included him in the split of proceeds.\n",

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. www.tribute-hwf.com\n\n\"Since the classical age of Greece, the golden ratio has been well known as the most balanced and therefore most aesthetically perfect proportion. In fact, it is supposedly often found in the fine arts and architecture and it is certainly important in geometry. But where is the proof that it is really the most beautiful proportion?\n\n\"The computer is proving to be a useful tool in exact art theory. Works of computer art are produced with the help of programs that describe the logic of the construction and its relevant measures. By varying the parameters you can vary the shapes of objects, and on the basis of the reaction of the public you can determine the best option. So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n\"A statistical evaluation would be interesting. Please email me with your results for the optimal proportion.\"\n\nI found it heartwarming that in 2011, Herbert W. Franke wrote the above, accompanied with a simple functional program on a Wolfram Demonstration page (https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/IsTheGoldenRatioReallyTheMostBeautifulProportion/) titled 'Is the Golden Ratio Really the Most Beautiful Proportion?' and invited people to submit their findings to him.\n\nThe main idea behind this project is ratios, a variety of them, used in a variety of ways, such as how a rectangle is repeatedly subdivided, or how it influences the aspect ratio of the piece, or how the colors in a palette are selected. These are represented in various styles, some of which are inspired by the aesthetic of Herbert W. Franke's diverse artworks, and his openness to experimentation with new technologies, such as plotter drawings, screens, screenprints, or 2D and 3D digital renderings.\n\nThis project, while not designed to be a formal statistical evaluation, is but my fun, colorful, and humble response to your inquiry, dear Herbert.\n\n---\n\n25% of primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke, with the goal of raising 20,000 Euros so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any money raised beyond this goal will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• Double-click/tap or 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n\nNote: Some mints require WEBGL and/or may take several seconds to fully render.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid",

However, I've developed a new small bit of code I am testing here; I am trying to create a \"clumping\" noise function that looks natural but doesn't have the obvious \"look\" of Perlin noise, and is more controllable. This piece contains my first public use of this. So it is, in a way, a test. \n\nI was inspired by the IRL paintings of Francesco D'Adamo, specifically his \"Manifesti\" series, although (as is the way of things) the end result looks nothing like what I started with, and is a more general 1950s abstract expressionism look. \n\nThis piece is a gift to the collectors of all my recent \"a\" mints.

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "menToll was inspired by a series of OP Art paintings done by Victor Vasarely, called Toll (from the Permutations Series). (c. 1965) Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the fifth in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nmenToll is two layered piece. A 2x2 array of arrays of circles contained within a background square. A similar sized array of squares (with no background of its own) is superimposed and centered on top. Each array of circles with a square has an opacity gradient applied to it allowing its uniquely colored random background to show through its elements. The superimposed top layer of squares is a solid random color.\n\nThere are many Gestalt interactions within this piece. Circle groups within each of their containers interact with each other, and their background, in interesting ways. Each new generation with its random color assignments significantly affects your depth perception. The top layer appears to come forward or recede depending on the layer it overlaps. And depending on color combinations there is a variety of \"after-imagism\" interactions between the squares in the top set. More candy for your mind.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Cousin Sirko was inspired by a series of OP Art prints done by Victor Vasarely, called Tlinko. (c. 1956) Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the seventh in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nCousin Sirko is a black and white composition. It is drawn either with black figures on a white background or vice versa. Its in an optical piece that starts out as a regular field of squares but random smaller areas of squares within the frame are transformed. Transformations to these smaller areas can be rotation, skew, and squash.\n\nThe visual phenomena represented here is called differences against a background. My understanding is that in our evolution as humans, when we were all hunters, we learned to see slight differences in a large background such as a forest canopy, grassland or desert. For example, a squirrel moving in the trees or a rabbit through a field of grass. I'm sure there is some psychological term for this but I'll leave that for you to investigate.\n\nAgain, there are many Gestalt interactions within this piece. The most prominent being the figure-ground relationship. As well areas of unifying structure. \n\nBy the way my father's sister Juby married George Sirko. As a result I have three cousins named Sirko: Randy, Mary and Daniel.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",
