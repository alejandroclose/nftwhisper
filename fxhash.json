            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

            "description": "At length, I summoned the courage to approach.\n\n-\n\nI was worn. Months of aimless wandering have culminated in this series; a meditation on my struggles to find a direction in my life and with my art.\n\nAt times paralyzed by too many possibilities, and at other times completely void of ideas. I was lost in the depths of my thinking, overwhelmed by indecision and doubt.\n\nGenerative works are a form of process art, yet along the way I’d forgotten to “trust the process”. It was time to cede control and let each line of code light the way.\n\n-\n\nThis project paints on a 2D canvas, pixel by pixel. I used a custom projection that blends isometric and perspective techniques, to create an uncanny viewpoint between the two. Objects are randomly generated, then an algorithm applies color mixing and position displacement to each pixel as it’s rendered.\n\nBy default the canvas has 2k pixels on its longest edge. You can change this in live view by pressing any number from 1-9. For example, pressing ‘4’ would render it with 4k pixels along the longest edge. I recommend ‘4’, but this can take up to a few minutes to render.\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the rendered image.",

            "description": "In the collaborative project for The Fable, Kristen and Iofeye are exploring questions and themes in the space where human-technology-nature intersect. Based on AI generated fable-like creatures and fictional language, combined with intuitively created analog signs as well as sound, they are playing with the idea of telling possible stories about these creatures through different unpredictable generative results. More than a predetermined story, the project is a kind of a contemplation and a question about the crucial role of language, story and imagination in our relationship to the natural world around us and the technology that we develop and engage with.\n\n\nKristen Applegate\nhttps://kristenapplegate.crevado.com/ \n\nAs an artist, I am inspired by the intersection of technology and traditional craftsmanship. My work often uses humor to make playful yet thought-provoking statements about the consumption of animals, insects, and even humans as food. Recently this exploration has taken the form of creating AI images that become actual or projected surface decoration for pieces of ceramic dinnerware. Prompt-crafting with AI interfaces such as Midjourney and DALL-E allows me to create the odd animal-like storybook characters as well as the imaginative renderings of meat that appear in my work. My “anti-tale” characters are depicted in a vintage style that adds an element of nostalgia.\nFor our Floor project, Iofeye and I are delving further into the notion of storytelling using the extra anti-tale characters who did not make the cast list for my ceramic work. In this project, they get to tell their own stories in their own languages. I'm excited to hear what they say.\n\n\nIndira Iofeye\nhttps://linktr.ee/iofeye\n\nMy art is characterised by experimentation, exploration and intuitive expression and I am drawn to the potential that lies in collisions and connections between different media, expressive formats and conceptual universes. I am fascinated by the hybrid creations, by unlikely collisions and combinations, unpredictable turns and “mistakes”. For me, art and the artistic process are not solely about expressing something that already exists or is known, but also a way to ask and address questions about multiple aspects of existence, self, world and our relationships to different phenomena. It is also about opening up to a discovery and the encounter with the unknown inside oneself and the world through the creative process.\n\nSome of the themes that I have worked with and that occupy me are storytelling by different means, the role of myth and the phenomenon of language, its role in our self-imaginary and our relationship to it.\n\nThe combination, the intersection and the synthesis of different themes, concepts and modalities of work that Kristen and I have brought into the project has given rise to a really engaging and interesting collaborative process and generated new fascinating avenues of possible explorations and discovery.\n\n--\n\nThis token is part of The Floor Exhibit co-curated by the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC and Fort Gallery NFT.\n",

I'm putting it out as a limited release with some organization imposed on the placement of the beads. Hopefully someone will find a rare one with 8 spheres!\n\nRoyalties will be shared with THREE.js and Girls Who Code as I have chosen to support both causes in all of my work starting with Orbital Plowing v1.0.\n\nContinuing my experiment to create very realistic glass spheres that can be manipulated and moved within the THREE.js environment. The glass spheres move in unusual orbital paths plowing through a field of hundreds of plastic beads of various sizes.\n\nExtremely rare to get 8 glass spheres... By the randomness imposed, 30% will have one sphere, 30% two, 20% three, 10% four, 5% five, 3.5% six, 1% seven and 0.5% eight. Happy hunting!\n\nInteractive with several user controls:\n\nWith the mouse:\n\nLeft click and drag to change the viewing angle\nRight click and drag to change the view center\nMouse wheel to change the distance to the view center\n\nWith the keyboard:\n\nKeys \",\" and \".\" (i.e. \"<\" and \">\") change the rotation speed left or right. You can stop it entirely, or speed it up to what I consider a reasonable maximum, rotating to the left or to the right. Each time you press, it adjusts the rotation speed.\n\nPress \"a\" to change the lighting angle.",

            "description": "In the collaborative project for The Fable, Kristen and Iofeye are exploring questions and themes in the space where human-technology-nature intersect. Based on AI generated fable-like creatures and fictional language, combined with intuitively created analog signs as well as sound, they are playing with the idea of telling possible stories about these creatures through different unpredictable generative results. More than a predetermined story, the project is a kind of a contemplation and a question about the crucial role of language, story and imagination in our relationship to the natural world around us and the technology that we develop and engage with.\n\n\nKristen Applegate\nhttps://kristenapplegate.crevado.com/ \n\nAs an artist, I am inspired by the intersection of technology and traditional craftsmanship. My work often uses humor to make playful yet thought-provoking statements about the consumption of animals, insects, and even humans as food. Recently this exploration has taken the form of creating AI images that become actual or projected surface decoration for pieces of ceramic dinnerware. Prompt-crafting with AI interfaces such as Midjourney and DALL-E allows me to create the odd animal-like storybook characters as well as the imaginative renderings of meat that appear in my work. My “anti-tale” characters are depicted in a vintage style that adds an element of nostalgia.\nFor our Floor project, Iofeye and I are delving further into the notion of storytelling using the extra anti-tale characters who did not make the cast list for my ceramic work. In this project, they get to tell their own stories in their own languages. I'm excited to hear what they say.\n\n\nIndira Iofeye\nhttps://linktr.ee/iofeye\n\nMy art is characterised by experimentation, exploration and intuitive expression and I am drawn to the potential that lies in collisions and connections between different media, expressive formats and conceptual universes. I am fascinated by the hybrid creations, by unlikely collisions and combinations, unpredictable turns and “mistakes”. For me, art and the artistic process are not solely about expressing something that already exists or is known, but also a way to ask and address questions about multiple aspects of existence, self, world and our relationships to different phenomena. It is also about opening up to a discovery and the encounter with the unknown inside oneself and the world through the creative process.\n\nSome of the themes that I have worked with and that occupy me are storytelling by different means, the role of myth and the phenomenon of language, its role in our self-imaginary and our relationship to it.\n\nThe combination, the intersection and the synthesis of different themes, concepts and modalities of work that Kristen and I have brought into the project has given rise to a really engaging and interesting collaborative process and generated new fascinating avenues of possible explorations and discovery.\n\n--\n\nThis token is part of The Floor Exhibit co-curated by the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC and Fort Gallery NFT.\n",

            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "by Daeinc\nAug 2022\n\nDuet explores generative+computational motion and creates an almost infinite sequence of visual compositions. Two groups of shapes transform, merge, and split randomly. What can be disorienting starts to make sense as every element is animated from one to the other. This transition animation is what connects random pieces and creates a relationship between them. Each element is mathematically interpolated, with its motion defined by an equation. \n\nAlthough there are key moments, it is hard to summarize time-based work as a static image. As a constantly evolving generative motion piece, Duet invites viewers to form their impression by feeling the rhythm over time.\n\n## Guide:\n- The animation responds to window aspect ratio. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- For reliable playback, keep the window active and use IPFS view.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.5.1 with Chromium 104.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction\n- [n] to play a new random loop.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause.\n- [s] to save PNG. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [up] and [down] to change shape resolution.\n- [left] and [right] to change BPM. only works while looping. \n- [h] to toggle high DPI mode. off by default.\n- [p] to toggle pixel snapping. off by default.\n\n## URL Parameters\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&w=1200&h=600\n- [w] and [h]: set width and height in pixels. (ex. w=1200&h=600)\n- [s] and [e]: set starting and ending keyframes (inclusive) for loop. (ex. s=20&e=24) \n- setting large values for start/end is not advised.\n- [len]: instead of start/end, set a loop length between 1 and 16. (ex. len=4)\n- [bpm]: beats per minute. (ex. bpm=80)\n- [res]: shape resolution between 0 and 18. (ex. res=2)\n- [pr]: pixel ratio. set it to 2 (or press [h]) for hi-DPI screens.\n- [ar]: maximum aspect ratio. set to any value over 1. 1.2 by default.\n- [snap]: add the param to snap to pixel grid.\n\n## License\nCC BY-NC 4.0\nPlease refer to the included LICENSE.md for license information.\nLibraries used: canvas-sketch, canvas-sketch-util, dom-events, hsv2rgb, keyframes, equations from easings.net, array shuffle from stackoverflow.",

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.
