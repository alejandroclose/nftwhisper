          "description": "This is a variant of John Conway's Game of Life, which adds an important restriction: water.  All life needs water to survive in this variant, either on the organism's square, or on an adjacent square. Owners of the token can enjoy viewing life survive under different sets of randomized deterministic environments with different beautiful color schemes, and different % of water in the environment under the modified rules for the game.  Frame rate is also a feature, as life proceeds and moves at different paces, and the owner will either get the advantage of something very slow to look at, or life, death, fruitfulness, famine, and colonization which seems to unfold in moments depending on whether the organism was able to get to water.  The token owner will be able to view different scenarios by changing screen size, but running the simulation again on the same screen size will produce the same unique simulation.  Some people say it looks like a microscope.  Maybe it is.  Or maybe it's the start of a grand simulation in the metaverse.  Hopefully children will see this token today and learn to appreciate the beauty of the world around us today.  This is my Genesis NFT.

          "childrenDescription": "This is a variant of John Conway's Game of Life, which adds an important restriction: water.  All life needs water to survive in this variant, either on the organism's square, or on an adjacent square. Owners of the token can enjoy viewing life survive under different sets of randomized deterministic environments with different beautiful color schemes, and different % of water in the environment under the modified rules for the game.  Frame rate is also a feature, as life proceeds and moves at different paces, and the owner will either get the advantage of something very slow to look at, or life, death, fruitfulness, famine, and colonization which seems to unfold in moments depending on whether the organism was able to get to water.  The token owner will be able to view different scenarios by changing screen size, but running the simulation again on the same screen size will produce the same unique simulation.  Some people say it looks like a microscope.  Maybe it is.  Or maybe it's the start of a grand simulation in the metaverse.
