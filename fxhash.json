Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid.

Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction.

            "description": "'Tesseract' is a generative collection drawing on the concept of the cube from oneirology, the interpretation of dreams. In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

            "description": "Our vision is to create meaningful generative artworks that express human sentiments about their social experiences.\n\nWe’re currently focused on experiences centered around celebration, and we’ve chosen a theme that connects people through music.\nMusic has the power to evoke a wide range of emotions within us, especially when experienced through a collective experience.\n\nWe wanted to generate an artistic script that visually captures these expressions. \n\nOur first music NFT collection reflects human sentiments towards Tomorrowland 2022. \nIt's a creative collaboration with dahleea, an artist dedicated to colors, who gave us the inspiration for the visuals you are seeing through one of her beautiful and colorful artworks.\n\nCoding, music, and art collide to recreate emotions expressed by people coming together from all over the world to share music and connection at one of the world’s leading music festivals. \n\nThe creative process:\n\nData was collected via emotion analysis using Twitter’s API. Our data is derived from emotion analysis models to extract the emotion scores (Happiness, Anger, Sadness, Fear, and Surprise) from 105,762 tweets, written in English, and containing mention of ‘Tomorrowland' between July 15, 2022, to August 8, 2022. \n\nOur analysis demonstrated the following emotions:\n\nHappiness: 38%\nAnger 8%\nSadness: 26%\nFear: 28%\n\nMusic:\n\nIn Pillars of Tomorrow, there are 4 instruments: bass, piano, percussion (hi-hat, kick, snare, claps, fx sounds), and a quiet pad. All the rhythms are self-written using Ableton, exported, and randomly selected to create the backbone of our generative music NFT.\n\nThis music piece has 4 different parts (basic, drop, break, after-drop) which are looped 3 times. All parts include different rhythm variations which are chosen randomly. \n\nThe generative harmony is present in the basic and after-drop parts. The key to generating harmony is using the emotion percentages above as possibilities for the next piano chord and melody to sound happy or sad.  \nWe chose to distort our bass sound according to anger trait values, as distortion can turn a mild bass into an aggressive one. \n\nFinally, there is also an emotion of surprise, which is associated with a special background and the sound of bells ringing.  The surprise element trait of the mints will be revealed after the Pillars of Tomorrow collection is fully minted.\n\nWe wanted to make a dynamic collection that would give you the feeling of a live music event, an interactive experience. A big stage flowing with music and diverse human expressions.\n\nc-camera start/stop\np pause (or play)\n\nspace (play/stop)\n\nl (change where the camera look)\n\nArrow Up (View pillars from above)\nArrow down (go to starting position)\nArrow left/right (camera moving direction)\n\nAWSD work as arrows as well\nscroll (Zoom In/Out)\n\nenter (screenshot)\n\nFor an optimal experience, we recommend using Google Chrome.\n\n#CodingIsArt\n\n",

Additional patterns are combined in the grid with these distortions to create the final artwork.\n\nPatterns for the individual blocks in the grid are divided into categories, and various amounts are picked for each work, with dozens of possible mixtures. Patterns can flow in different directions across the varied canvases. Distribution of these patterns across the grid varies from work to work, providing for different feels as they bunch together or spread apart.",

In this series, urban ensembles are generated with a simple click. With each iteration appears a new densely built city block. Graced with impeccable geometrical lines, devoid of any human presence, these buildings remind us of brutalist utopias like Le Corbusier’s Cité radieuse or Niemeyer’s Brasilia. But despite their clearly modernist feel, there is something hauntingly primitive about them. They could be either New Mexican adobe pueblos, Minoan palaces, or Turkish troglodyte dwellings. Both carved and sculpted, these Ghormenghasts of concrete float in a realm out of time, like in some architect’s dream.\n\nThe purpose of this creative work is to generate 3D architectural projects that could be implemented in the real world. The accelerating lives that we live, complicated by growing and unpredictable environmental crises, call for an enhanced capacity to come up quickly with new architectural solutions adapted to different contexts. From computer assisted design to 3D printing, from augmented reality to real-life housing, from sculpture to architecture, this work aims at bridging the gap between the virtual and the tangible.\n\nWorking as a visual artist, David Umemoto draws inspiration from his training as an architect. He has been using low-tech methods for a long time, refining his talent for elegant simple shapes and combinatory constructions. Now, poured concrete and home-made moulds are giving way to zero-gravity rotating models. The skills he developed while working with real objects find a new playground in the virtual realm.\n",
