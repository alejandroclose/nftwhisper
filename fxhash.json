            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

J. T. Mitchell discusses the concept of \"digital imagery\" and references a mythological figure, Urizen, who appears in the works of William Blake. Mitchell states:\n\n\"Urizen represents measurement and division, drawing the circumference of the world and delineating the boundaries between light and darkness, serving as the sacred rational architect fundamental to the visible universe.\"\n— \" Image Science: Iconology, Visual Culture, and Media Aesthetics \" Chapter 11, by W. J. T. Mitchell.\n\nFrom William Blake's portrayal of Urizen, I sense a central figure in the creation of the world's myriad forms, one immersed in calculating the incalculable, measuring elusive patterns, and tracing the vortex of ever-flowing boundaries.\n\nIn my view, this represents the ongoing collaboration between humanity and computer today.\n\n▒\n\nIn mathematics, θ (theta) typically represents an angle on a plane. Through calculations involving points, lines, and angles (with the assistance of computers), we can create an almost infinite array of shapes. For me, at this level, θ has become a fundamental metaphor underlying the creation of digital imagery.\n\nIn this artwork 'θ', I attempt to connect the metaphorical aspects of mythology with mathematical calculations, imagining myself as a cartographer of creation, striving to capture the fissures in image generation.\n\nHowever, this also signifies that I cannot create anything outright; I am always an individual trying to master the elusive calculations. Only be continually captivated by the corporeal perception and temporal characteristics of digital imagery.\n\n▒\n\n[Key] commands\n\n〘P〙 - pause / continue drawing\n\n〘S〙 - save image // (keep Drawing)\n\n〘1〙〘2〙〘3〙〘4〙 - get higher res image // (Stop Drawing)\n〘2642x3852〙〘3303x4815〙〘3963x5778〙〘4624*6714〙\n\n▒\n\n[Note]\n\n-The display on mobile devices may vary slightly, and it is recommended to open live view on a computer for the best experience.",

            "description": "Generative animated artwork made using shader feedback and pixel quantization.\n\nWRAPPERS is a study of virtual surfaces and textures. It explores the tension between hard and soft forms and parallel projection, where the illusion of perspective is flattened into a highly geometric composition. These geometries feature a flowing texture that runs infinitely, reflecting on the endless nature of virtual space. The project blends together imagery from early computer terminals, video games, and ascii art to produce a dynamic, intricate, visual experience.\n\nWRAPPERS is very GPU intensive. For a smoother experience, you can change the scale by adding the parameter \"?scale=2\" to the URL.\n\nPress 'i' to invert the colors.\nPress '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6' to scale the bitmap glyphs.\nPress 'g' to download a looping animated GIF (150 frames). Please make sure to let the animation run for at least 30 seconds first.\nPress 's' to capture a single frame.\nPress 'f' (or double tap in mobile) to stretch to full screen.\nMade with vanilla javascript and GLSL.

            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

            "description": "There is a place in a remote village with only forest and huge meadows and hills around it. I used to spend a few days there in the summer. This year it has become my retreat for the whole summer. There is silence around and no persistent explosions from the bombing. I wanted to use this time to relax and reflect.\n\nWhen I began working on the project, I had no specific goals in my mind. I didn't set myself any tasks, didn't commit to any deadlines. Suddenly, I found something that reminded me of blooming meadows, it was in tune with my state at that moment. So I started to develop this theme. I did not aim to turn it into a realistic picture. The images were supposed to remain abstract, just to convey the general mood and impressions I was feeling.\n \nInitially, it was a story about summer meadows and grasses. But in the process, I had memories of impressions that arose in different seasons, which I observed in nature here. Colour became the main conductor of the story about various states of nature. It is common to see a lot of black soil in spring through which fresh shoots break through, creating bright splashes on a dark background. During the early summer, the area is covered in lush grasses and wildflowers, as well as butterflies. The world blooms and life is reborn. Eventually, the grasses wither due to the hot sun. Sun-burnt straw sheaves take on a special beauty and texture.  As autumn approaches, we turn to the terracotta range, which offers a variety of ripe mature flowers. Winter is all about graphics. During this period, I usually like to take black and white pictures. Every time, every state of nature has its own beauty. As well as every period of our life.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nPlease pay attention: for rendering the project you might need a rather powerful CPU.

J. T. Mitchell discusses the concept of \"digital imagery\" and references a mythological figure, Urizen, who appears in the works of William Blake. Mitchell states:\n\n\"Urizen represents measurement and division, drawing the circumference of the world and delineating the boundaries between light and darkness, serving as the sacred rational architect fundamental to the visible universe.\"\n— \" Image Science: Iconology, Visual Culture, and Media Aesthetics \" Chapter 11, by W. J. T. Mitchell.\n\nFrom William Blake's portrayal of Urizen, I sense a central figure in the creation of the world's myriad forms, one immersed in calculating the incalculable, measuring elusive patterns, and tracing the vortex of ever-flowing boundaries.\n\nIn my view, this represents the ongoing collaboration between humanity and computer today.\n\n▒\n\nIn mathematics, θ (theta) typically represents an angle on a plane. Through calculations involving points, lines, and angles (with the assistance of computers), we can create an almost infinite array of shapes. For me, at this level, θ has become a fundamental metaphor underlying the creation of digital imagery.\n\nIn this artwork 'θ', I attempt to connect the metaphorical aspects of mythology with mathematical calculations, imagining myself as a cartographer of creation, striving to capture the fissures in image generation.\n\nHowever, this also signifies that I cannot create anything outright; I am always an individual trying to master the elusive calculations. Only be continually captivated by the corporeal perception and temporal characteristics of digital imagery.\n\n▒\n\n[Key] commands\n\n〘P〙 - pause / continue drawing\n\n〘S〙 - save image // (keep Drawing)\n\n〘1〙〘2〙〘3〙〘4〙 - get higher res image // (Stop Drawing)\n〘2642x3852〙〘3303x4815〙〘3963x5778〙〘4624*6714〙\n\n▒\n\n[Note]\n\n-The display on mobile devices may vary slightly, and it is recommended to open live view on a computer for the best experience.",

            "description": "Summer Daydream is the final chapter in a nature trilogy that I've worked on throughout 2023. The inspiration comes from both the superbloom in California this spring, and the carefree summer vacations of my childhood. I used to live close to a beautiful woodland in northern China, with a willow-lined creek filled with lotus and water lilies. I spent many long summer days playing in the woods with my friends, pretending to be explorers, detectives, martial arts masters, and more ... back then I only dreamed of the future, and now I sometimes dream of the past. Things as small as the taste of a hawthorn berry or the fragrance of a pagoda tree would pull my mind back to that simpler time. I can't remember the shape of the creek or the paths we took, yet the colors are still vivid as new, and they bring me a sense of happiness and peace. \n\nThe artwork is best viewed in full screen mode in a Chrome browser. \n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.09\n\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is based on the width of the browser window.\n[j] Save a JPEG image of the live view, default resolution is based on the width of the browser window.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 1.78 (16/9)]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1.33]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n&res=[output size of the long edge]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

            "description": "Generative animated painting made from looping gestures in a virtual void.\n\nVoyagers is an exploration of automated gestures and screenspace layering effects. Each brush stroke sweeps through the canvas leaving a trail of color that either disappears or mixes with adjacent colors. The image slowly builds up to achieve an equilibrium between the rhythm of the gestures and the interaction of color values. These colors are quantized and dithered to produce chunky, textured, blocks of light that reify the materiality of the screen and the pixel. Two aspect ratios are possible, each with its own material relationship to screen-based work, 1:1 and 4:3 (vertical).\n\nPress 's' to save looping animated GIF (live mode only).\nPress 'p' to pause the animation.\nPress 'c' to capture a single frame.\nMade with P5.js and GLSL.

J. T. Mitchell discusses the concept of \"digital imagery\" and references a mythological figure, Urizen, who appears in the works of William Blake. Mitchell states:\n\n\"Urizen represents measurement and division, drawing the circumference of the world and delineating the boundaries between light and darkness, serving as the sacred rational architect fundamental to the visible universe.\"\n— \" Image Science: Iconology, Visual Culture, and Media Aesthetics \" Chapter 11, by W. J. T. Mitchell.\n\nFrom William Blake's portrayal of Urizen, I sense a central figure in the creation of the world's myriad forms, one immersed in calculating the incalculable, measuring elusive patterns, and tracing the vortex of ever-flowing boundaries.\n\nIn my view, this represents the ongoing collaboration between humanity and computer today.\n\n▒\n\nIn mathematics, θ (theta) typically represents an angle on a plane. Through calculations involving points, lines, and angles (with the assistance of computers), we can create an almost infinite array of shapes. For me, at this level, θ has become a fundamental metaphor underlying the creation of digital imagery.\n\nIn this artwork 'θ', I attempt to connect the metaphorical aspects of mythology with mathematical calculations, imagining myself as a cartographer of creation, striving to capture the fissures in image generation.\n\nHowever, this also signifies that I cannot create anything outright; I am always an individual trying to master the elusive calculations. Only be continually captivated by the corporeal perception and temporal characteristics of digital imagery.\n\n▒\n\n[Key] commands\n\n〘P〙 - pause / continue drawing\n\n〘S〙 - save image // (keep Drawing)\n\n〘1〙〘2〙〘3〙〘4〙 - get higher res image // (Stop Drawing)\n〘2642x3852〙〘3303x4815〙〘3963x5778〙〘4624*6714〙\n\n▒\n\n[Note]\n\n-The display on mobile devices may vary slightly, and it is recommended to open live view on a computer for the best experience.",
