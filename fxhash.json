And while we devise systems for solving unfathomably complex problems, generating algorithmic creativity, and unlocking regenerative biological possibilities, we simultaneously cling to the power and originality of emotional feeling – believing it to be the irreplaceable source of what makes us human.\n\nIf the body is our shell for emotion and soul, can an artificial humanoid be another vessel for these thoughts and feelings – for human essence itself? If our ‘soul’ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable? That we may see answers to these questions looks more real every year, and is perhaps a little frightening. \n\nEmotional Shell uses introspective portraits of future selves to question what it means to be human, when the people around us are no longer human.\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 1-3 to select from low, medium, and high quality settings\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2400px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nTENDER x wwatkns\nAugust 2022",

Sometimes those variations will combine, sometimes you have to get to really high numbers for multiple prime numbers to combine.\n\nWhere the finally Tally! ends up who knows?

In practical terms, as the iteration count increases, both the minimum and maximum possible number of cols&rows gradually increase.\n\n3200x3200px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

            "description": "#tezpole has demonstrated to us all the importance of effective Cable Management. Intrigued by this challenge, I've delved deep into the pixels of this issue. 🙂\n\nDrawing inspiration from Rev Dan Catt’s 'Tally!' and applying similar principles of Cable Management, I've assembled a fun and free OE project.\n\nThis project dynamically evolves with each iteration.Grid is determined by a random value calculated as follows: the lower bound starts at 3 and increases incrementally with every 100 iterations, while the upper bound starts at 4 and increases with every 30 iterations. In practical terms, as the iteration count increases, both the minimum and maximum possible number of cols&rows gradually increase.\n\n3200x3200px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

            "description": "Our lives are like a rich tapestry of interconnected moments, emotions, and decisions that weave and evolve through space and time. These experiences meld together, forming the intricate fabric of our being, shaping our perspectives, and influencing our sense of self, identity, and worldview. Within this elaborate lattice of life, the delicate threads that fill the interstitial spaces illuminate our existence's fluid and ever-changing dynamics.\n\n\"Liminalia\" is an abstract generative art collection that celebrates these liminal moments and spaces that define us, embracing the beauty of imperfection, transformation, and the interrelation of human experiences. The collection employs abstract visual language to portray the delicate balance between randomness and structure, emphasising the significance of our perception of time in shaping these elements and our individual experiences.\n\nThe collection explores life's complexity through the interwoven colours and picture planes that create fluid spaces and in-between zones. With an appreciation for natural surfaces and organic processes, such as erosion, ageing, and patina formation, the collection emphasizes interconnectedness through an organic aesthetic. The carefully designed colour palettes, inspired by various events and phenomena, capture the essence of time and enhance the liminal themes explored throughout the collection.\n\nThrough its harmonious blend of colour, form, and space, \"Liminalia\" explores the subtle junctures where time, nature, and personal development meet and interact. The collection fosters a dialogue between art, science, and the enigmatic mysteries of our existence, underlining the ties between humans and the ever-evolving beauty of the natural world. Consequently, it imparts a sense of optimism, prompting self-reflection and contemplation, and encourages us to appreciate the inherent charm of time's rhythm and the interdependence of all things.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nfx(params)\nLiminalia has recently introduced the fx(params) system, allowing initial minters greater engagement and influence over the final artwork. This innovative system lets you to personalize the final output while exposing the algorithm to greater scrutiny. As a token of appreciation, 20% of the royalties go to the minter.\n\nFor more information on Liminalia's core themes, creative process, and key parameters, see my recently published article at https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/liminalia.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical\nMade with P5JS and Chroma.js\nOptimized and best viewed in Chrome.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nResolution and Printing\nLiminalia is best experienced in print, providing an immersive and detailed view of the intricate details, rich colour palettes and dynamic interplay of themes.\n\nControls in live mode\n# Press [1] - [5] to change the resolution.\n# Press [s] or [j] to save as PNG or JPEG at the current resolution\nHigh res [5] will output a 10,500px x 16,000px image.\nPlease note that the rendering is processed in 3 main steps, and the filters applied at the end may take a few minutes to render for very high resolution.\n\nTo track the progress of the rendering process, access the development console in your desktop browser.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nLicense\nThis project is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAcknowledgements\nA big shout-out to everyone who pitched in on this project; your input and effort were invaluable. I'm grateful for your collaboration, and you all totally rock!\n------------------------------------------------------------",

            "description": "Our lives are like a rich tapestry of interconnected moments, emotions, and decisions that weave and evolve through space and time. These experiences meld together, forming the intricate fabric of our being, shaping our perspectives, and influencing our sense of self, identity, and worldview. Within this elaborate lattice of life, the delicate threads that fill the interstitial spaces illuminate our existence's fluid and ever-changing dynamics.\n\n\"Liminalia\" is an abstract generative art collection that celebrates these liminal moments and spaces that define us, embracing the beauty of imperfection, transformation, and the interrelation of human experiences. The collection employs abstract visual language to portray the delicate balance between randomness and structure, emphasising the significance of our perception of time in shaping these elements and our individual experiences.\n\nThe collection explores life's complexity through the interwoven colours and picture planes that create fluid spaces and in-between zones. With an appreciation for natural surfaces and organic processes, such as erosion, ageing, and patina formation, the collection emphasizes interconnectedness through an organic aesthetic. The carefully designed colour palettes, inspired by various events and phenomena, capture the essence of time and enhance the liminal themes explored throughout the collection.\n\nThrough its harmonious blend of colour, form, and space, \"Liminalia\" explores the subtle junctures where time, nature, and personal development meet and interact. The collection fosters a dialogue between art, science, and the enigmatic mysteries of our existence, underlining the ties between humans and the ever-evolving beauty of the natural world. Consequently, it imparts a sense of optimism, prompting self-reflection and contemplation, and encourages us to appreciate the inherent charm of time's rhythm and the interdependence of all things.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nfx(params)\nLiminalia has recently introduced the fx(params) system, allowing initial minters greater engagement and influence over the final artwork. This innovative system lets you to personalize the final output while exposing the algorithm to greater scrutiny. As a token of appreciation, 20% of the royalties go to the minter.\n\nFor more information on Liminalia's core themes, creative process, and key parameters, see my recently published article at https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/liminalia.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical\nMade with P5JS and Chroma.js\nOptimized and best viewed in Chrome.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nResolution and Printing\nLiminalia is best experienced in print, providing an immersive and detailed view of the intricate details, rich colour palettes and dynamic interplay of themes.\n\nControls in live mode\n# Press [1] - [5] to change the resolution.\n# Press [s] or [j] to save as PNG or JPEG at the current resolution\nHigh res [5] will output a 10,500px x 16,000px image.\nPlease note that the rendering is processed in 3 main steps, and the filters applied at the end may take a few minutes to render for very high resolution.\n\nTo track the progress of the rendering process, access the development console in your desktop browser.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nLicense\nThis project is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAcknowledgements\nA big shout-out to everyone who pitched in on this project; your input and effort were invaluable.

            "description": "'Bustling Bright' is a generative drawing on the conpect of the nature of flowers, light, and ground, in an planer and abstract art style. I explore different geometric layouts to mimic variants of plants structures in the nature environment of my garden, full of youth and vitality. The representation of ground is aggregated by group of polygons, filled with smooth and chaotic textures.\n\nThis work is also an exploration of generative art in its deterministic structures and stochastic variants. I try to use minimal factors to construct a rich, varied and meaningful results. The constrints and combinations between parameters/factors are deterministic parts of the generative art and the emergence of variety in the complex generation process is its stochastic and unpredictable soul. The deterministic structure provides a stable state of the generative process, but the stochastic parts give the most interesting and unique feelings of the artwork. So what is a generative artwortk? In my opinion, the genrative artwork is not about any one piece of generated result. The Generative artwork is about the total generative space, which represents its all structures and varieties. The creation process of a generative art is not about the author, but also with all its collectors in minting. Because this is a samling process of the generative space, and it is the only way for our human to feel and understand this high dimensional generative space.\n\nI hope you like this work and enjoy the whole nature in its beauty.\n\nVariables:\n- 7 strucure pattern\n- 17 color palette\n- 2 layout\n\nPlease be patient with drawing process.",

            "description": "'Bustling Bright' is a generative drawing on the conpect of the nature of flowers, light, and ground, in an planer and abstract art style. I explore different geometric layouts to mimic variants of plants structures in the nature environment of my garden, full of youth and vitality. The representation of ground is aggregated by group of polygons, filled with smooth and chaotic textures.\n\nThis work is also an exploration of generative art in its deterministic structures and stochastic variants. I try to use minimal factors to construct a rich, varied and meaningful results. The constrints and combinations between parameters/factors are deterministic parts of the generative art and the emergence of variety in the complex generation process is its stochastic and unpredictable soul. The deterministic structure provides a stable state of the generative process, but the stochastic parts give the most interesting and unique feelings of the artwork. So what is a generative artwortk? In my opinion, the genrative artwork is not about any one piece of generated result. The Generative artwork is about the total generative space, which represents its all structures and varieties. The creation process of a generative art is not about the author, but also with all its collectors in minting. Because this is a samling process of the generative space, and it is the only way for our human to feel and understand this high dimensional generative space.\n\nI hope you like this work and enjoy the whole nature in its beauty.\n\nVariables:\n- 7 strucure pattern\n- 17 color palette\n- 2 layout\n\nPlease be patient with drawing process.",

As an analogy to this daily occurrence, emoticons appear and with the good spirit of simplifying they begin to gnaw away so much literary flourish.\n\nThe piece puts in counterpoint two forms of communication: emoticons and traditional writing. Here an inevitable contrast is sought between the standardization of the feelings of emojis, and the excessive flourishes of texts, possibly already from other times.\n\nOriginal flute (tap & frullato), cello (pizz) and marimba samplers.\n((click to start sound))\n\n[s] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)",
