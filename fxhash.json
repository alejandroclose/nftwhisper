            "description": "The work is part of a digital art movement that integrates art, mathematics, and physics in the creation of new works of art.\nIn my work, I deconstruct materials and investigate the nature of bodies and their components, which has some overlap with experimental particle physics. Particle accelerator experimental devices produce a set of geometric shapes and lines, which I have used in this work. Various exotic particles are created through acceleration, filtering, and collisions. It is often my intention to question relationships between objects and contexts, reality and imagination, and realism and abstraction using imaging and machine learning methods. This project is very close to what I think of as the machine mentality that by imagination is activated as demarcation and categorization critique, it conforms.\n\nMade by, p5.js - CSG.js\ns = save",

I discussed it with a friend and we decided to do it together.\nWe bought the stones, took them to the garden, and started paving clumsily.\nWhen we had only done a small amount of it, I was very frustrated and tired.\nI went inside the building to see the paving from the top floor.\nI was amazed by what I saw. A full-fledged artwork!\nMaybe we didn't follow the rules and principles of paving, but when we looked at the result from above, everything was in its proper place.\nNow, every time I step on this pavement, I tell myself, don't forget to look from above!\nThat trouble and helplessness turned into pleasure and peace for me with just one look from above.\nMaybe this is the main point of life. Looking at the issues from above.\nThis collection is inspired by this simple story, but it was a valuable achievement for me.\nI hope the audience of this work will enjoy looking at things from above.\n\nS = Save\nMade by p5.js",
