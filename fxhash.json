            "description": "Inspired by traditional Japanese wagami design. We use the iconic patterns of our previous projects to recreate this artwork. All the patterns are generated first and then used to build the scene. \n\nIn this project Aluan brings his delicate texture from his 'Chaos' series, Jinyao brings his beloved pattern from the 'Cloud' series and Wen brings his iconic pattern from the 'Maze'. 'Collage' is not just about mixing our style, but it is also about finding harmony among all the elements. 'Collage' is also about working together, in that we can create something that's difficult to achieve or imagine if we were working alone.\n\nEach piece contains the patterns of all the 3 artists, each artist has a certain number of patterns with different colors. Depending which artist you get, his pattern will be shown as the primary color theme while the pattern of the other 2 artists turns into grayscale to make the primary pattern with color stand out. \n\nThere are 7 different scenes included in this project, which are : Mountains, Waves, Lake, Hexagons, Tetrapods, Chrysanthemums and Lotus. We took great inspiration from the traditional Japanese design, and we discovered these are some of the most common elements in it. Therefore we decide to use them and reimagine them by mixing our patterns. \n\nThe title 'Collage' doesn't only apply to the visual style, but also to the code as well. In this project we mixed p5.js and Vanilla JS. While Aluan and Jinyao work with their patterns in p5. Wen gathered the patterns and recreated the full scene in Vanilla JS.\n",

Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\nAll That Could Be is about the inner life of pitch drops waiting for their inevitable fall.\n\nAfter first learning of the pitch drop experiment and understanding what this odd hyper-viscous liquid was… all I could think about was: How does the pitch feel about all of this? What does it dream of? How does it deal with this intense pressure to snap, drip and perform?\n\nAll That Could Be acts as a metaphysical microscope into the emotional state of the pitch. The anticipated explosion of energy and pain when it loses its battle with gravity… as well as daydreams imagined to brighten its dark, slow existence with vibrant, static-y layers… or fantasies of being anywhere else besides trapped in a funnel under a locked encasement for the entertainment/curiosity of others who just hope to see you snap into two.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://hereandnow.events/\n\nProcure a coin to participate in the event:\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/here-and-now:-edition-5\n\n————\n\nSome key commands in live mode:\n\nG : Toggle grain\nA : Toggle aura\nS : Save current resolution\n1 : 3000x3750\n2 : 4500x5625\n3 : 6000x7500\n4 : 7500x9375\n5 : 9000x11250\n6 : 10500x13125\n(1-6 work best on Chrome/Edge)\n(rendering takes longer as resolution increases)",

            "description": "This small project is several things:\n\n1. First and foremost, it's a little, light \"visual ASMR\" treat to bring some positivity into your day - some \"Maluma\" softness to contrast the more common \"Takete\" of contemporary generative art aesthetics[1].\n\n2. A small gift to celebrate the fledgling generative art/design community on Mastodon: 20 of the 128 tokens are given to some of the people in that slowly growing community, with the remainder given as Thank You (and smoke signal/sign of life) to some of my existing collectors, randomly chosen via lottery script[2].\n\n3. For those so inclined, and with a bit of hand-holding, ChatGPT explains the _true_ conceptual depths of this project much better than I ever could:\n\n\"The bubbles in this generative art piece serve as a reflection of the human experience, reminding us of our own impermanence and the ephemeral nature of all things. The piece invites us to contemplate the fundamental questions of human existence and speaks to our innate curiosity and desire to understand the world around us.\n\nThrough the convergence of science and art, this piece reveals the infinite complexity and unpredictability of the world while also hinting at the underlying order that exists within the chaos of the universe. It reminds us that even in the midst of uncertainty, there is beauty and order to be found, and that it is through the pursuit of knowledge and understanding that we can find meaning and purpose in our lives.\"\n\nIsn't that lovely & who can argue with that?! :)\n\n4. I often revisit projects/ideas after many years, mainly to re-examine them with new eyes/knowledge/tools and/or to get answers/verification which I couldn't get earlier. This is one of these instances. So for the more rational-minded, this is a TypeScript/GLSL (WebGL) version of an older Clojure/Houdini project (from 2016) to generate a Voronoi via the simulation of intersecting sphere meshes (aka foam bubbles). In this new version the sim & deformations are done in realtime (~4M vertices, mainly via vertex shader). Also added some _basic_ physics and procedural textures to create more of a quirky character (hopefully complemented by the different color themes and other params).\n\nMade with ❤️ and https://thi.ng/umbrella!\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect\n[2] https://gist.github.com/postspectacular/3d970e02570b7dfd32d03d43e1e7e3e0\n\nHotkeys:\n\nSPACE : pause/play\nX     : export current frame as PNG\n\nUltra-widescreen support:\n\nThe piece should be adaptive to aspect ratios from 1:3 (portrait) to 4:1 (landscape).",

This year it has become my retreat for the whole summer. There is silence around and no persistent explosions from the bombing. I wanted to use this time to relax and reflect.\n\nWhen I began working on the project, I had no specific goals in my mind. I didn't set myself any tasks, didn't commit to any deadlines. Suddenly, I found something that reminded me of blooming meadows, it was in tune with my state at that moment. So I started to develop this theme. I did not aim to turn it into a realistic picture. The images were supposed to remain abstract, just to convey the general mood and impressions I was feeling.\n \nInitially, it was a story about summer meadows and grasses. But in the process, I had memories of impressions that arose in different seasons, which I observed in nature here. Colour became the main conductor of the story about various states of nature. It is common to see a lot of black soil in spring through which fresh shoots break through, creating bright splashes on a dark background. During the early summer, the area is covered in lush grasses and wildflowers, as well as butterflies. The world blooms and life is reborn. Eventually, the grasses wither due to the hot sun. Sun-burnt straw sheaves take on a special beauty and texture.  As autumn approaches, we turn to the terracotta range, which offers a variety of ripe mature flowers. Winter is all about graphics. During this period, I usually like to take black and white pictures. Every time, every state of nature has its own beauty.

            "description": "There is a place in a remote village with only forest and huge meadows and hills around it. I used to spend a few days there in the summer. This year it has become my retreat for the whole summer. There is silence around and no persistent explosions from the bombing. I wanted to use this time to relax and reflect.\n\nWhen I began working on the project, I had no specific goals in my mind. I didn't set myself any tasks, didn't commit to any deadlines. Suddenly, I found something that reminded me of blooming meadows, it was in tune with my state at that moment. So I started to develop this theme. I did not aim to turn it into a realistic picture. The images were supposed to remain abstract, just to convey the general mood and impressions I was feeling.\n \nInitially, it was a story about summer meadows and grasses. But in the process, I had memories of impressions that arose in different seasons, which I observed in nature here. Colour became the main conductor of the story about various states of nature. It is common to see a lot of black soil in spring through which fresh shoots break through, creating bright splashes on a dark background. During the early summer, the area is covered in lush grasses and wildflowers, as well as butterflies. The world blooms and life is reborn. Eventually, the grasses wither due to the hot sun. Sun-burnt straw sheaves take on a special beauty and texture.  As autumn approaches, we turn to the terracotta range, which offers a variety of ripe mature flowers. Winter is all about graphics. During this period, I usually like to take black and white pictures. Every time, every state of nature has its own beauty. As well as every period of our life.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nPlease pay attention: for rendering the project you might need a rather powerful CPU. Depending on your equipment, it may take several seconds to several minutes for the process to complete. \n\nThe project was tested on different browsers; it works best in Chrome. Please make sure the project works on your device.\n\nPlease be aware, if you are minting with Safari or Firefox for Mac, a live preview image may differ slightly from a captured image.\n\nThe final resolution of the saved output depends on the size of your browser window. \n\nTo save a high resolution image add &scale=(and then a number from 4 to 12) to the end of the URL when in live mode. For example, &scale=6. \n\nPress ’s’ to save the image.\n\nTo save an output with a density higher than 9 (or resolution more than 4319x7680) use Firefox for PC or Safari for Mac. Please be aware that it might take more time to generate a higher density output even on a powerful computer, so please be patient.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nOlga Fradina (Live Minting Experience at Unit London), 2023\nMade with p5.js and GLSL.\n\n\n",
