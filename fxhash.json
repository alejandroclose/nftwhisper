            "description": "🎧 CLICK/TAP FOR SOUND ON\n\nSaṅkhāra is a portrait of symbolic consciousness in three movements.\n\nColorful automata represents direct experience: touch, sight, hearing, smell, taste and thought in a ceaseless flow of novelty.\n\nThe automata congeals into form alluding to the way our minds close over experience with symbolic representation, like a plastic bag coming down over a kaleidoscope of butterflies. What was free in the open air is now trapped. What was previously wild and unpredictable is now under control, frozen and communicable.\n\nThe form’s dispersal mimics the release of mental formation, the unbinding of a symbol, the letting go of a belief. It’s a visceral reflection of the process of ceasing to identify with separateness. To strain the previous metaphor, it’s the opening of the bag and letting the butterflies return to the flow of raw, boundless experience.\n\n—\n\nK.C. Austin\nFrom his cockpit in the Blue Ridge Mountains K.C. Austin (aka bzor) spends his days shaping realtime software art systems of all stripes. Informed by game design, modular synths, virtual reality and consciousness research, K.C. plays shaders like a fiddle and fashions creative pipelines like a spider spins webs.\n\nJames Paterson\nFascinated by the relationship between ancient and futuristic mediums, James Paterson has been exploring a unique synthesis of drawing, code, animation and sculpture under the moniker ‘Presstube’ since 1999. Paterson draws inspiration from meditation, molecular biology, music, parenting and psychedelics - the seen, the heard, the felt, the cognized.",

According to legend, an ancient civilization of high intelligence, called the Explorers of Latent Space, distributed hundreds of monoliths throughout time and space in order to study the behavior of species in the infinite Universe.\n\nSome say that it is the divine intelligence of God. Others say that, in spite of their objectual and material condition, the monoliths possess their own consciousness and an intelligence beyond the natural and artificial. Their purpose or objective, to this day, remains a mystery.\n\n_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_\n\nthis work is done only with code, using threejs and p5js\nit might be a bit slow on low-end devices, be patient",
