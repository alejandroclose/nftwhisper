            "description": "Strands of memory are twisted and entangled with each other, blending in and out with the surrounding fog of chaos. Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

            "description": "There’s so much more to our world than what we are able to perceive, let alone understand. Will we ever be able to even fully understand ourselves?\n\n–\n\nElevation is a series of 320 generative elevation drawings of imaginary structures. It is a reminder of the limits of our consciousness, and an ode to the manifold nuances that lie beyond what we can perceive, beyond what we even can imagine.\n\nAs a generative artist, I aim to elevate my own consciousness with the help of the machine. I welcome algorithms and randomness into the creation of my works, taking full control, and intentionally giving it away, always seeking to expand my imagination. For as humans alone, we remain limited to our own edifice of thought, and often fail to free ourselves from the visible, mundane world.\n\nBoth are present in Elevation: the visible and the imaginary, the mundane and the transcendent, the solid and the fragile. Where an architect’s elevation drawing marks the transition from the thought world into the visible world, Elevation remains in-between, depicting both the idea of an imaginary structure, and the structure itself.\n\n–\n\nElevation is intended for print. All holders of an Elevation NFT will be able to order the corresponding signed print in the respective paper format via andreasrau.eu/elevation. Press [s] to save the image as displayed or [p] to generate a print-ready PNG image at 300 dpi. This might take a while, depending on paper format and your hardware.\n\n–\n\nElevation\np5.js, glsl, html, css\nAndreas Rau, 2022",

            "description": "640 unique sketches of imaginary walls, inspired by the work of Norwegian architect Erling Viksjø (1910–1971) and his artist collaborators. Viksjø designed the Government Quarter in Oslo and invited artists from different disciplines to help design the facades and interiors of the buildings.\n\nViksjø’s aim was to “soften” modernist architecture. He invented «Natural Concrete», a type of concrete that deliberately exposes the mixed-in stones on its surface to give it warmth and a human touch. In my work, I have similar ambitions—using code instead of concrete.\n\nThe different styles of the piece are inspired by, and dedicated to some of the artists who worked together with Viksjø: Jakob Weidemann (~2%), Carl Nesjar (~18%), Odd Tandberg (~30%), and Tore Haaland (~50%).\n\nIn live mode, press ‘S’ to save an image at current resolution or ‘P’ to save a high-resolution file at 6000×6000px (this might take a while depending on your hardware).\n\nOriginal artwork by Andreas Rau · Made with p5.js & glsl · Oslo, 2021",

            "description": "Tendencies is the first in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art in the 1970s.\n\nZajec's generative work was motivated by redundancy in his paintings: \"The monotony of the manual task and the limited number of variations which I was able to produce in a given time made me realize the inadequacy of traditional methods in dealing with our present reality.\" Tendencies was inspired by — and pays tribute to — one if Zajec's earliest forays into generative creation: a work titled RAM 10 V.15, which was written on an IBM 1620 and programmed in FORTRAN.\n\nThe title of the collection itself is a reference to the first exhibition of Zajec's RAM series, while the number of editions minted referencing the year Zajec put plotter to paper.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated December 2022\nBy @christine_hall\n",

            "description": "This series explores the remnants and imprints of past events; the unintended consequences and marks left behind: The floor of a painter's studio, layered with splatters and spills; the face of a rock, sculpted by the relentless touch of water and ice; the rusty hood of a forsaken car, weathered and chipped under the harsh sun.\n\nThe art piece is crafted by an algorithm simulating the effects of abrasion from a consistent yet dynamic process. It links a thousand pairs of points, harmoniously shifting across the canvas, with delicate lines. At each intersection of these lines, color is applied. To produce the final piece, multiple layers of varying colors and intensities are superimposed.\n\n------\n\nControls:\n\n- [x] Save a PNG\n\n- [1] Set height to 768\n- [2] Set height to 1152 \n- [3] Set height to 1536 (default)\n- [4] Set height to 2304\n- [5] Set height to 3072* \n- [6] Set height to 6144*\n- [7] Set height to 9216*\n- [8] Set height to 11520*\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render height\n\n\n* images with height over 3000 pixels render without animating, downloads a PNG automatically after rendering\n\nPlease note that high resolution outputs will take several minutes or even longer to render.
