This piece was used as the cover of The Tickle #30, and also received a static mint on Rarible. \n\nSeveral months later, I re-visited the land of isometrics and \"fake 3D\" for my \"isometry\" piece here on fx(hash), and which you can find here: https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/13199\n\nI always wanted to do a true determinative piece in the style of the original \"cityscapes,\" and this weekend I finally sat down and \"ported\" it to modern fx(hash) output. Since this piece and \"isometry\" share a commonality, I named this piece \"isometry II,\" and added the \"watercolor\" as that was the original name of the piece before I minted it on H3N. \n\nI hope you enjoy it!",

            "description": "🔥 BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY \"open edition\" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",

If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",

The objective is to share a personal perspective on how we bring home and nurture us while involving ourselves in a new environment.\nMy starting point towards the installation, is Legado, a generative art piece I created in 2022 where I explored the legacy of the women in my family and how I integrate it in my present life to take care of myself.\nIn “Arraigos, estudios 2” I go back to a classroom, my notebooks, and my pens. From that place I just drew lines, free lines, wondering lines. I keep drawing them. They bring me home.\nI always chose graph paper, even to write and there used to be four common pen colors in my school days: blue, black, red, and green.  That is the palette I have created for this mint.\nPress from “1” to “7” to render at higher resolutions. \nPress “s” to save a .png file at you given resolution.\n",

A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time. \nRichard Nadler created the textures to control composition and color. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels. This collaboration is enabled by twitter and fxhash, as the generative art community continues to explore abstraction in summer 2022 – while extreme temperatures, wildfires, ongoing conflicts and volatile markets continue to escalate. \n\n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color. \n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen mode. \n- Press “s” to save the current canvas. \n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nhttps://leanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/",

            "description": "ASCII-SCAPE\n\nLike for many others growing up during the 1980s & 90s, my very first hands-on encounter with actual computer graphics (outside of games) was in the form of \"textmode\" and its various alphanumeric characters and other symbols available on the 8bit home computers of that period. These machines were perfectly capable of producing fairly high-resolution & multi-color graphics (all relative), yet most systems booted into an interactive prompt with the so-called textmode as de-facto standard environment, providing a level, if also limited, playing field for the creation of text-based graphics from a patchwork of characters & symbols of a predefined font (system or custom). As is so often the case, limitation is the mother of invention and the regular, monospaced grid and standardized set of characters quickly encouraged an entire subculture of specialized designers & artists to emerge (which is currently being re-discovered & remixed by younger generations), applying & showcasing their creativity (with often surprisingly ingenious skills) in the form of game designs, user interfaces, disk mags, demoscene productions, competitions, flyers, BBSes and even various early Web designs of the mid/late 90s.\n\nASCII-SCAPE is an attempted non-nostalgic homage to these roots & culture. It is also a textmode-only (no canvas!) rework of my previous piece C-SCAPE. It combines my love of cellular automata with the stripped back aesthetics & limitations of using only text as representation medium of these co-evolving generative systems. It required an almost complete rewrite & re-curation of various elements: 1200+ new handpicked rule combinations, 32 character sets, 40 color themes, new relationships & biases to better manage the resulting textures, densities and contrast.\n\nAlthough technically not strictly \"ASCII\" (an actual standard, but also a popular shorthand for \"text only\"), the entire simulation only uses various Unicode characters and the beautiful Iosevka open source typeface by Renzhi Li aka Belleve Invis.\n\nLike its parent C-SCAPE, this project is dynamic and evolves indefinitely. It's best viewed on non-mobile devices, where there's a decent horizontal resolution to provide sufficient simulation space. Please see the C-SCAPE project description for further details. There's no graphical export feature, but output can be captured into an UTF-8 plain text file (max. 100k lines/generations).\n\nThe following keyboard shortcuts are available:\n\n- space : toggle simulation updates (pause/play)\n- r : randomize environment\n- x : start/stop recording\n- f : toggle scroll speed (fast/slow)\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nIosevka typeface licensed under OFL-1.1 license\n\nhttps://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and https://thi.ng",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Each city comes with its own randomized city day.\n\nEach mint has a native setting (Day or Night) which combined with the current time of viewing influences real-time movements of celestial bodies in your mint, e.g. on a mint with the Day setting, the sun will only appear when viewed during the day. The piece will re-render every minute.\n\nThe individual strokes of this token feature some of my latest developments of an algorithm that generatively simulates the texture of print imperfections. They are randomized at each render to give it a unique character. Note that depending on the complexity of each mint, some renders may introduce a brief pause. The aesthetics are greatly inspired by plotter art of early computer artists such as 'City Painting' by Grace C. Hertlein.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Nov 2021\nArtist: @Yazid",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "In Between\n\nGenuary is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things, with 31 prompts to base your code art off. Genuary 2023 took place during the month of January 2023. Afterwards, as it happens, comes Genuary 32nd. This is an imaginary week, during which we develop one of our Genuary pieces into a 32 edition \"not very long\"-form generative project on fx(hash).\n\nMy Genuary 32nd project is based on Genuary 22nd: Shadows, the design of which again was based on the \"art deco\" pattern from day 20.\n\nThe patterns form a grid-like fence structure, dividing the space and creating an infinite cage. Light coming from the outside casts stark shadows on the floor. Several variations on halftoning techniques are used to portray tone, occasionally destroying depth perception into an abstract interplay of form.\n\nThe code of this piece has been diminished into a mere 3397 characters.\n\nYou can use the URL-parameter &m=2 as a resolution multiplier, to render images larger than your screen.\n\n(c) 2023 by Piter Pasma. https://piterpasma.nl",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens —created in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco— that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking “what if” questions such as “What if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?” Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road —one direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature— it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario’s thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",
