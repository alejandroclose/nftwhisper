In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

The template is aimed at TypeScript (but can be easily adapted to plain JavaScript) and, at the time of writing, uses Vite as dev & build tool, ensuring an altogether great & speedy workflow with minimal fuzz.\n\n(In the future, I'm aiming to provide an alternative version for more advanced hybrid projects using TypeScript, Zig (https://ziglang.org) and WebAssembly (https://webassembly.org/)...)\n\nFramework agnostic\n\nEven though several packages from the https://thi.ng/umbrella ecosystem are used to provide various essential overarching functionality, the template is organized in such a way that the main parts are completely framework-agnostic. You should be able to easily plug in your own toolkit of choice, however I cannot promise to provide support for this myself (though happy to accept PRs, also in terms of further docs, how-tos, guides etc.)\n\nExample project\n\nA tiny, fully documented throwaway example sketch is included, illustrating the following:\n\n- Overall project structure & build commands\n- FXhash related setup\n- Static & dynamic configuration and state (re)initialization (via dependency graph)\n- FXhash PRNG wrapper & utilities\n- Canvas & SVG conversion/export/download\n- 2D geometry creation, transformation & drawing\n- Basic vector algebra example usage\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\n\n- space :  pause/play animation\n- x : download canvas as PNG\n- s : download SVG version\n\nIn case of doubt, it's this example project what is used here for minting. The funding, however, will be used for the further maintenance of both this project template and supporting my other open source work. 20% are also donated to the FXhash development team itself.\n\nThank you for your support! üôèüòç",

            "description": "ASCII-SCAPE\n\nLike for many others growing up during the 1980s & 90s, my very first hands-on encounter with actual computer graphics (outside of games) was in the form of \"textmode\" and its various alphanumeric characters and other symbols available on the 8bit home computers of that period. These machines were perfectly capable of producing fairly high-resolution & multi-color graphics (all relative), yet most systems booted into an interactive prompt with the so-called textmode as de-facto standard environment, providing a level, if also limited, playing field for the creation of text-based graphics from a patchwork of characters & symbols of a predefined font (system or custom). As is so often the case, limitation is the mother of invention and the regular, monospaced grid and standardized set of characters quickly encouraged an entire subculture of specialized designers & artists to emerge (which is currently being re-discovered & remixed by younger generations), applying & showcasing their creativity (with often surprisingly ingenious skills) in the form of game designs, user interfaces, disk mags, demoscene productions, competitions, flyers, BBSes and even various early Web designs of the mid/late 90s.\n\nASCII-SCAPE is an attempted non-nostalgic homage to these roots & culture. It is also a textmode-only (no canvas!) rework of my previous piece C-SCAPE. It combines my love of cellular automata with the stripped back aesthetics & limitations of using only text as representation medium of these co-evolving generative systems. It required an almost complete rewrite & re-curation of various elements: 1200+ new handpicked rule combinations, 32 character sets, 40 color themes, new relationships & biases to better manage the resulting textures, densities and contrast.\n\nAlthough technically not strictly \"ASCII\" (an actual standard, but also a popular shorthand for \"text only\"), the entire simulation only uses various Unicode characters and the beautiful Iosevka open source typeface by Renzhi Li aka Belleve Invis.\n\nLike its parent C-SCAPE, this project is dynamic and evolves indefinitely. It's best viewed on non-mobile devices, where there's a decent horizontal resolution to provide sufficient simulation space. Please see the C-SCAPE project description for further details. There's no graphical export feature, but output can be captured into an UTF-8 plain text file (max. 100k lines/generations).\n\nThe following keyboard shortcuts are available:\n\n- space : toggle simulation updates (pause/play)\n- r : randomize environment\n- x : start/stop recording\n- f : toggle scroll speed (fast/slow)\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nIosevka typeface licensed under OFL-1.1 license\n\nhttps://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and https://thi.ng",

The template is aimed at TypeScript (but can be easily adapted to plain JavaScript) and, at the time of writing, uses Vite as dev & build tool, ensuring an altogether great & speedy workflow with minimal fuzz.\n\n(In the future, I'm aiming to provide an alternative version for more advanced hybrid projects using TypeScript, Zig (https://ziglang.org) and WebAssembly (https://webassembly.org/)...)\n\nFramework agnostic\n\nEven though several packages from the https://thi.ng/umbrella ecosystem are used to provide various essential overarching functionality, the template is organized in such a way that the main parts are completely framework-agnostic. You should be able to easily plug in your own toolkit of choice, however I cannot promise to provide support for this myself (though happy to accept PRs, also in terms of further docs, how-tos, guides etc.)\n\nExample project\n\nA tiny, fully documented throwaway example sketch is included, illustrating the following:\n\n- Overall project structure & build commands\n- FXhash related setup\n- Static & dynamic configuration and state (re)initialization (via dependency graph)\n- FXhash PRNG wrapper & utilities\n- Canvas & SVG conversion/export/download\n- 2D geometry creation, transformation & drawing\n- Basic vector algebra example usage\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\n\n- space :  pause/play animation\n- x : download canvas as PNG\n- s : download SVG version\n\nIn case of doubt, it's this example project what is used here for minting.
