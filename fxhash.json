It draws inspiration from an impersonal observation of modern society, critically examining historical events, corporations, and notable figures who have sold their soul for individualistic power that disregards the lives of others and the environment.\n\nAn ever-evolving project that will mature its search for soulless bodies over time.\n\n1984 token, at a price as provocative as the theme of the collection.\n\nAny reference to individuals, things or concepts is entirely coincidental and generated by a hash.",

The name \"Sketch Block\" reflects the process of creation that inspired the token's design. Like an artist's sketchbook, the token captures the playful experimentation and exploration that underlies the creative process.\n\nThe hand-drawn style gives a playful feel to the project, with each shape looking as if it was quickly drawn onto the canvas. Along with the use of vibrant color palettes with tones ranging from soft pastels to bold and bright tones, the projects can produce a wide range of different results.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Controls:\n\n- Press 'h' to save the image",

Releasing this project means a lot, not only from the work I've put in it, but from the chapter of my life it closes.",

By working on the spacing of these lines and the drawing angle, we obtain what I see as some kind of negative artwork if we compare it to the original project.\n\nNot wanting to distort my initial work, I chose to publish this in a separate complementary experimental work. So this is a gift to all of you who chose to collect my work \"Paths of Thought\", to let you explore a detail of the project that I really do like.\n\nIf you have the opportunity to plot your edition, I recommend doing it with a used pen, which will achieve a vintage look and an interesting end result.\n\nIn live view, you can download a plottable SVG by pressing \"s\"\n\nCoded with care, and with the help of p5.js and p5.js-svg libraries.\nConsider any bug that you could get in your edition as a blessing from the RNG Gods !",

            "description": "Inspired by the work of Georg Nees, this project uses various rules to connect vertices to lines, building many chaotic shapes. By constraining these shapes into a grid, we can achieve a regularly chaotic artwork. And by reintroducing a bit of randomness in the size of the cells of the grid, we end up with an irregularly chaotic work.\n\nFrom this mixture of regularity and chaos, of lines and vertices, arise multiple questions about the many possible paths that everyone can take at any given time when faced with a decision. Whether we take the simplest or the most twisted path, whether we free ourselves from the limits or whether we stay within the imposed bounds, whether we take the most obvious path or whether we look for the most astute one, in the end, we too often have the impression of going around in circles...\n\nAs always, it's complicated!\n\n---\n\nYou can downloads various SVG versions of this artwork :\n\n1/ open artwork in live view\n\n2/ Press 0 to 4 to get a plottable SVG :\n\n- 0 for a printable SVG, which use alpha transparency for filling (default mode)\n- 1 for 0.1mm pen tip plottable SVG\n- 2 for 0.3mm pen tip plottable SVG\n- 3 for 0.5mm pen tip plottable SVG\n- 4 for 1mm pen tip plottable SVG\n\n3/ If you are asking for a plottable SVG, you can press C to get separate hatching colors for each alpha transparency filling color, which allow you in Saxi to use different pen colors for hatching.

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

            "description": "This experimental project involves an on-chain cellular automaton. The features and cellular automaton rules are derived from the minter's address. Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",
