            "description": "### OVERVIEW ###\nThis project revisits some of the foundational ideas in my previous work \"Above (The Infinite)\" and makes them available in a parameterized form for your exploration.\n\nThis project both rewards and requires exploration. I intentionally left the parameter space very broad so that edge case configurations would be possible. In practice this means that additional curation beyond the initial random parameters will very likely be required, in a way that mimics my day to day experience as a generative artist.\n\nThanks to Karsten Schmidt for his excellent thi.ng libraries (https://thi.ng/), which form the technical foundation upon which this work was built.\n\n### CONTROLS ###\ne - Save the current frame as a PNG\nspace - Pause/Resume animation\n\n### PARAMETERS ###\nNOTE: Some combinations of parameters will cause flashing/strobing, which is why I have attached the \"Epileptic Seizure\" label to the project.\n\n* Color Palette: The color palette to apply to the output.\n* Merge Technique: The method used to combine the different patterns.\n* Patterns: The various patterns that can be combined to form the overall resulting tiled pattern.\n* Pattern Scales: The scales used to combine patterns. Higher scale values provide more visible pattern repetition.\n* Deformers: An optional additional spatial deformation of a pattern.\n* Deformer Scales: The scale of the deformation itself. Lower values use less of the deformation space, while higher values include more.\n* Detail: Acts as a filter on the visual complexity of the overall tiled pattern. Lower values will reduce visual complexity, while higher values will increase it.\n* Rotation Rate/Scroll Rates: How fast should the image rotate or scroll. Note: adjusting these parameters may result in visuals that trigger motion sickness.\n* Zoom: Lower values zoom in, higher values zoom out.\n* Round Scales Up?: When checked the pattern scales are rounded up to the nearest integer.\n* Animate?: Should some parameters be adjusted with the passing of time?\n* Low Res?: When checked, force device pixel density to 1, which reduces strain on the GPU, but may result in graphical artifacts. I usually keep this unchecked unless I want to lighten the load on the GPU.\n* Anti-alias?: When checked each pixel will be sampled multiple times to attempt to smooth out possible aliasing. This will put more load on the GPU, and will typically be slower. Can be useful when \"Low Res?\" is enabled.\n\n### HOWTO ###\nHere's how I find interesting things.\n\nFirst, I lock all of the parameters below \"Pattern 3\" at their default values. I will also usually lock both Deformers to \"Empty\", as they can sometimes hide interesting patterns while exploring, and then I experiment with enabling one or both once I have found something interesting.\n\nYou can also explore the options individually (to a certain degree) by setting other patterns to \"Empty\". This can make how patterns affect one another more obvious when you set them.\n\nAt this point I'll randomize the parameters, and then do one of the following:\n\n- If I see something that's extremely noisy/detailed, I'll turn down the \"Detail\" level, which can sometimes smooth things out.\n\n- If a tiling is very tight, I'll lower the \"Zoom\" to see more of the pattern, or the reverse if I want to see more overview.\n\n- If there's still a lot of aliasing/noise in the image, sometimes enabling anti-aliasing will help, but that will affect performance. I usually try to adjust the Scale/Detail/Zoom before resorting to anti-aliasing.\n\n- Interesting patterns are formed by the scale factors controlling how pattern overlap happens. Sometimes enabling \"Round Scales Up?\" will introduce some appealing visual symmetry.\n\n- Enable one or both of the deformers to see what impact they have on the pattern.\n\nFinally, once I've found a pattern that's interesting, I may enable scrolling or rotation. Note that enabling additional movement can increase graphical aliasing, so anti-aliasing may be required depending on the pattern.\n\nI hope you enjoy the exploration process!\n\n- Jeff Palmer\n",

            "description": "### OVERVIEW ###\nThis project revisits some of the foundational ideas in my previous work \"Above (The Infinite)\" and makes them available in a parameterized form for your exploration.\n\nThis project both rewards and requires exploration. I intentionally left the parameter space very broad so that edge case configurations would be possible. In practice this means that additional curation beyond the initial random parameters will very likely be required, in a way that mimics my day to day experience as a generative artist.\n\nThanks to Karsten Schmidt for his excellent thi.ng libraries (https://thi.ng/), which form the technical foundation upon which this work was built.\n\n### CONTROLS ###\ne - Save the current frame as a PNG\nspace - Pause/Resume animation\n\n### PARAMETERS ###\nNOTE: Some combinations of parameters will cause flashing/strobing, which is why I have attached the \"Epileptic Seizure\" label to the project.\n\n* Color Palette: The color palette to apply to the output.\n* Merge Technique: The method used to combine the different patterns.\n* Patterns: The various patterns that can be combined to form the overall resulting tiled pattern.\n* Pattern Scales: The scales used to combine patterns. Higher scale values provide more visible pattern repetition.\n* Deformers: An optional additional spatial deformation of a pattern.\n* Deformer Scales: The scale of the deformation itself. Lower values use less of the deformation space, while higher values include more.\n* Detail: Acts as a filter on the visual complexity of the overall tiled pattern. Lower values will reduce visual complexity, while higher values will increase it.\n* Rotation Rate/Scroll Rates: How fast should the image rotate or scroll. Note: adjusting these parameters may result in visuals that trigger motion sickness.\n* Zoom: Lower values zoom in, higher values zoom out.\n* Round Scales Up?: When checked the pattern scales are rounded up to the nearest integer.\n* Animate?: Should some parameters be adjusted with the passing of time?\n* Low Res?: When checked, force device pixel density to 1, which reduces strain on the GPU, but may result in graphical artifacts. I usually keep this unchecked unless I want to lighten the load on the GPU.\n* Anti-alias?: When checked each pixel will be sampled multiple times to attempt to smooth out possible aliasing. This will put more load on the GPU, and will typically be slower. Can be useful when \"Low Res?\" is enabled.\n\n### HOWTO ###\nHere's how I find interesting things.\n\nFirst, I lock all of the parameters below \"Pattern 3\" at their default values. I will also usually lock both Deformers to \"Empty\", as they can sometimes hide interesting patterns while exploring, and then I experiment with enabling one or both once I have found something interesting.\n\nYou can also explore the options individually (to a certain degree) by setting other patterns to \"Empty\". This can make how patterns affect one another more obvious when you set them.\n\nAt this point I'll randomize the parameters, and then do one of the following:\n\n- If I see something that's extremely noisy/detailed, I'll turn down the \"Detail\" level, which can sometimes smooth things out.\n\n- If a tiling is very tight, I'll lower the \"Zoom\" to see more of the pattern, or the reverse if I want to see more overview.\n\n- If there's still a lot of aliasing/noise in the image, sometimes enabling anti-aliasing will help, but that will affect performance. I usually try to adjust the Scale/Detail/Zoom before resorting to anti-aliasing.\n\n- Interesting patterns are formed by the scale factors controlling how pattern overlap happens. Sometimes enabling \"Round Scales Up?\" will introduce some appealing visual symmetry.\n\n- Enable one or both of the deformers to see what impact they have on the pattern.\n\nFinally, once I've found a pattern that's interesting, I may enable scrolling or rotation. Note that enabling additional movement can increase graphical aliasing, so anti-aliasing may be required depending on the pattern.\n\nI hope you enjoy the exploration process!\n\n- Jeff Palmer\n",

Sliders?\n\n\n“Pensado a mano” explores the intersection of Generative Art and Hand Drawing. The collector, by drawing a predefined number of shapes on canvas, creates a unique hand-crafted seed that generates the final artwork. That is the only customisable param, thought by hand, which interacts with various random attributes to produce a unique composition.\n\n“…the time we spend doing and making things, the process…”\n\nAnd yet the process continues. On the background, the code generates a plottable svg.\nAn artificially extended process, from hand to screen, from screen to paper, that creates a new kind of mixed media.\n\nSigned plots will soon be claimable via Artfora (tbd price + shipping)\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1 - Draw the requested shapes and wait to see the result. You can change the Seed Nr. slider if you don't like the selected mode.\n2 - Press “C” to copy drawing to Clipboard\n3 - Copy the clipboard contents to the text-input on the fx(params) sidebar\n\n***Important. If you buy several tickets, make sure you don't mint the same Seed Nr. twice (slider)\n\npress “S” to save the PNG, press “P” to plot the SVG\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis is a high-supply token minted during a bear market.

            "description": "WARNING: Read instructions so you don’t get a broken token!!\n----\n\n\nQ: Why haven’t you tried fx(params)?\nA: Pff.. Sliders?\n\n\n“Pensado a mano” explores the intersection of Generative Art and Hand Drawing. The collector, by drawing a predefined number of shapes on canvas, creates a unique hand-crafted seed that generates the final artwork. That is the only customisable param, thought by hand, which interacts with various random attributes to produce a unique composition.\n\n“…the time we spend doing and making things, the process…”\n\nAnd yet the process continues. On the background, the code generates a plottable svg.\nAn artificially extended process, from hand to screen, from screen to paper, that creates a new kind of mixed media.\n\nSigned plots will soon be claimable via Artfora (tbd price + shipping)\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1 - Draw the requested shapes and wait to see the result. You can change the Seed Nr. slider if you don't like the selected mode.\n2 - Press “C” to copy drawing to Clipboard\n3 - Copy the clipboard contents to the text-input on the fx(params) sidebar\n\n***Important. If you buy several tickets, make sure you don't mint the same Seed Nr. twice (slider)\n\npress “S” to save the PNG, press “P” to plot the SVG\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis is a high-supply token minted during a bear market. Have Fun.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "Action; system is an experimental study inspired by the work of François Morellet. Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution.

Sliders?\n\n\n“Pensado a mano” explores the intersection of Generative Art and Hand Drawing. The collector, by drawing a predefined number of shapes on canvas, creates a unique hand-crafted seed that generates the final artwork. That is the only customisable param, thought by hand, which interacts with various random attributes to produce a unique composition.\n\n“…the time we spend doing and making things, the process…”\n\nAnd yet the process continues. On the background, the code generates a plottable svg.\nAn artificially extended process, from hand to screen, from screen to paper, that creates a new kind of mixed media.\n\nSigned plots will soon be claimable via Artfora (tbd price + shipping)\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1 - Draw the requested shapes and wait to see the result. You can change the Seed Nr. slider if you don't like the selected mode.\n2 - Press “C” to copy drawing to Clipboard\n3 - Copy the clipboard contents to the text-input on the fx(params) sidebar\n\n***Important. If you buy several tickets, make sure you don't mint the same Seed Nr. twice (slider)\n\npress “S” to save the PNG, press “P” to plot the SVG\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis is a high-supply token minted during a bear market.

            "description": "WARNING: Read instructions so you don’t get a broken token!!\n----\n\n\nQ: Why haven’t you tried fx(params)?\nA: Pff.. Sliders?\n\n\n“Pensado a mano” explores the intersection of Generative Art and Hand Drawing. The collector, by drawing a predefined number of shapes on canvas, creates a unique hand-crafted seed that generates the final artwork. That is the only customisable param, thought by hand, which interacts with various random attributes to produce a unique composition.\n\n“…the time we spend doing and making things, the process…”\n\nAnd yet the process continues. On the background, the code generates a plottable svg.\nAn artificially extended process, from hand to screen, from screen to paper, that creates a new kind of mixed media.\n\nSigned plots will soon be claimable via Artfora (tbd price + shipping)\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1 - Draw the requested shapes and wait to see the result. You can change the Seed Nr. slider if you don't like the selected mode.\n2 - Press “C” to copy drawing to Clipboard\n3 - Copy the clipboard contents to the text-input on the fx(params) sidebar\n\n***Important. If you buy several tickets, make sure you don't mint the same Seed Nr. twice (slider)\n\npress “S” to save the PNG, press “P” to plot the SVG\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis is a high-supply token minted during a bear market. Have Fun.",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution. I tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge / Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iPhone, but please make sure it works on your device before minting.\n\n-----\n\nPossible features:\n\ncolor scheme: cairngorm, alborz, bardenas, atlas, bieszczady, watkins\n\nproportions: square, wide, standard, narrow\n\nframe: none, vignette, bright, dark, bright with vignette, dark with vignette\n\nvisitors: tourists, tourists and birds, solitary flock of birds, only light\n",
