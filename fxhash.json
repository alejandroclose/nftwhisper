            "description": "Everything is divisible. Larger organisms are made up of smaller ones, entire galaxies are comprised of stars, planets, people, dust, and one effect here and now ripples into eternity. Nothing exists without the elemental components that have evolved to make them possible — and nothing on the plane of existence arrives in isolation from something greater. This enmeshed reality is the concept of a Holon: a whole that is simultaneously part of another whole. \n\nAs cells, energies, beings, and ideas grow in complexity, each new advancement includes and transcends their holons, the very catalysts of evolution. What does this essential process look like on its own when scale, context, and definition are removed? The senses are forced to purely observe the present interactions and reactions that occur between all parts. This is what Holons attempts to portray — the witnessing of birth, formation, and crystallization simultaneously. \n\nUpon viewing each piece and inspecting its detail with curiosity — we can observe living reality that has been temporarily suspended from motion and artificially stopped for us to witness. Can we see what is a part, and what is a whole? Can we define what these holons are? \n\nLet each Holons remind us that the impossible can always be made; let each one be nothing and everything — organisms, cosmos, energy itself — all at once, for it’s the creation of something entirely new that best reminds us that everything is actually made of the parts already here. So, remember to create without barriers or limitations because reality itself is made of that which lives now only in imagination.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x flight404\nOctober 2022\n\nPress ‘h’ in live view to render a high resolution version of any token.\nPress ‘s’ in live view to save a .png of the current view of any token.\n\nHolons was created in vanilla Javascript and WebGL, but the majority of the work was done in GLSL shaders.

            "description": "I recall living for quite some time in urban village areas, where they formed within a striking urban setting. Unlike suburban houses where spaces are ample and most housings are planned with careful consideration of other houses, these urban villages are limited by site and geographic boundaries. So it's almost inevitable that houses are built so close with each other, so much that no house has a backyard or front yard, everything was just roof and walls as far as the eye can see. Because these dwellings grow persistently according to the wants and needs of their dwellers, as the families within these walls grow, so does the urban village.\n\nIt's a chaotic scene for sure, but urban villages have their own candid beauty. Just by looking from the stacked facades of the walls that made up the houses, we can imagine the warm dynamic between the people and strong living impulses that spark from behind these walls.\n\n------------\n20 Color Palettes\nZoomed-in View\nVarious Window Shapes\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\n\n\nCreated using p5.js\nDirbots - Oct22",

Unlike suburban houses where spaces are ample and most housings are planned with careful consideration of other houses, these urban villages are limited by site and geographic boundaries. So it's almost inevitable that houses are built so close with each other, so much that no house has a backyard or front yard, everything was just roof and walls as far as the eye can see. Because these dwellings grow persistently according to the wants and needs of their dwellers, as the families within these walls grow, so does the urban village.\n\nIt's a chaotic scene for sure, but urban villages have their own candid beauty. Just by looking from the stacked facades of the walls that made up the houses, we can imagine the warm dynamic between the people and strong living impulses that spark from behind these walls.\n\n------------\n20 Color Palettes\nZoomed-in View\nVarious Window Shapes\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\n\n\nCreated using p5.js\nDirbots - Oct22",

            "description": "I recall living for quite some time in urban village areas, where they formed within a striking urban setting. Unlike suburban houses where spaces are ample and most housings are planned with careful consideration of other houses, these urban villages are limited by site and geographic boundaries. So it's almost inevitable that houses are built so close with each other, so much that no house has a backyard or front yard, everything was just roof and walls as far as the eye can see. Because these dwellings grow persistently according to the wants and needs of their dwellers, as the families within these walls grow, so does the urban village.\n\nIt's a chaotic scene for sure, but urban villages have their own candid beauty. Just by looking from the stacked facades of the walls that made up the houses, we can imagine the warm dynamic between the people and strong living impulses that spark from behind these walls.\n\n------------\n20 Color Palettes\nZoomed-in View\nVarious Window Shapes\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\n\n\nCreated using p5.js\nDirbots - Oct22",

            "description": "Everything is divisible. Larger organisms are made up of smaller ones, entire galaxies are comprised of stars, planets, people, dust, and one effect here and now ripples into eternity. Nothing exists without the elemental components that have evolved to make them possible — and nothing on the plane of existence arrives in isolation from something greater. This enmeshed reality is the concept of a Holon: a whole that is simultaneously part of another whole. \n\nAs cells, energies, beings, and ideas grow in complexity, each new advancement includes and transcends their holons, the very catalysts of evolution. What does this essential process look like on its own when scale, context, and definition are removed? The senses are forced to purely observe the present interactions and reactions that occur between all parts. This is what Holons attempts to portray — the witnessing of birth, formation, and crystallization simultaneously. \n\nUpon viewing each piece and inspecting its detail with curiosity — we can observe living reality that has been temporarily suspended from motion and artificially stopped for us to witness. Can we see what is a part, and what is a whole? Can we define what these holons are? \n\nLet each Holons remind us that the impossible can always be made; let each one be nothing and everything — organisms, cosmos, energy itself — all at once, for it’s the creation of something entirely new that best reminds us that everything is actually made of the parts already here. So, remember to create without barriers or limitations because reality itself is made of that which lives now only in imagination.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x flight404\nOctober 2022\n\nPress ‘h’ in live view to render a high resolution version of any token.\nPress ‘s’ in live view to save a .png of the current view of any token.\n\nHolons was created in vanilla Javascript and WebGL, but the majority of the work was done in GLSL shaders. This setup was substantially assisted by fx(hash) community leader and artist Liam Egan who provided technical assistance and emotional support during the project's lifespan. For this reason, we have included him in the split of proceeds.\n",

            "description": "Everything is divisible. Larger organisms are made up of smaller ones, entire galaxies are comprised of stars, planets, people, dust, and one effect here and now ripples into eternity. Nothing exists without the elemental components that have evolved to make them possible — and nothing on the plane of existence arrives in isolation from something greater. This enmeshed reality is the concept of a Holon: a whole that is simultaneously part of another whole. \n\nAs cells, energies, beings, and ideas grow in complexity, each new advancement includes and transcends their holons, the very catalysts of evolution. What does this essential process look like on its own when scale, context, and definition are removed? The senses are forced to purely observe the present interactions and reactions that occur between all parts. This is what Holons attempts to portray — the witnessing of birth, formation, and crystallization simultaneously. \n\nUpon viewing each piece and inspecting its detail with curiosity — we can observe living reality that has been temporarily suspended from motion and artificially stopped for us to witness. Can we see what is a part, and what is a whole? Can we define what these holons are? \n\nLet each Holons remind us that the impossible can always be made; let each one be nothing and everything — organisms, cosmos, energy itself — all at once, for it’s the creation of something entirely new that best reminds us that everything is actually made of the parts already here. So, remember to create without barriers or limitations because reality itself is made of that which lives now only in imagination.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x flight404\nOctober 2022\n\nPress ‘h’ in live view to render a high resolution version of any token.\nPress ‘s’ in live view to save a .png of the current view of any token.\n\nHolons was created in vanilla Javascript and WebGL, but the majority of the work was done in GLSL shaders. This setup was substantially assisted by fx(hash) community leader and artist Liam Egan who provided technical assistance and emotional support during the project's lifespan. For this reason, we have included him in the split of proceeds.\n",
