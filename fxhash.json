            "description": "A mix of aesthetics from the Ukiyo-e and Shin-hanga woodblock movements, with modern elements.  \n\nukiyo-e (浮世絵) = \"pictures of the floating world\", which peaked in the late 19th century. \nshin-hanga (新版画) = \"new prints\", from roughly the 1920-1950s. \n\nSome comparisons between the prints of the Japanese masters and gen-art: \n\n* The number of prints. Based on how well a piece was received, the publisher could decide to produce more copies, usually in batches of 200. Compare this to limiting the edition size on fx(hash). The initial prints would have sharp lines and accurately coloured areas. Very popular prints with thousands of impressions would slowly degrade the blocks, leaving final prints with worn-out linework and colours that weren't true to originals.  \n\n* Woodblock prints were actually a collab between the artist, the wood carver, and the printer. In many cases only the artist and publisher were recognized on the final prints. It was usually the publisher who owned the woodblock, not the artist. Often the artist was considered a worker, contracted at the request of the publisher or patrons funding the project. Compare this to the NFT space, where ownership is carved onto the blockchain, and artists have freedom to create whatever they wish. \n\n* Copyminters.... Similar to the NFT world, fake publishers sprang up from time to time, who would reproduce famous prints. Enji Takamizawa was one such counterfeiter, who was able to skilfully produce woodblocks replicating originals down to the wood grain! \n\n* While fine-quality woodblock prints from the Edo era command huge auction prices today, they were in reality affordable art for the regular people of their time. NFTs are similar in this light, where we can enjoy pieces at home rather than say, visiting galleries or museums of unattainable art. \n\n\n\nAdditional querystring params (use when viewing in a separate window) \n\n* fullsize=true (33 megapixel output) \n* colourcorrect=false \n* grain=false \n* border=false \n\n\n\nLicenses included in source. Relying on: \n\n* PIXIJS for drawing \n* JSTS for geometry functions \n* chromajs for colour functions \n* noise and gaussian helpers from p5js ",

The pixels are constantly rearranging, being transferred from offer to taker, liquify, appear and disappear. They are forming endless compositions, sometimes intransparent or with strange spins.\n\nThe level of abstraction has been set to a 2x pixel size and the color palette of the NES with 12 different color modes. 16 pixel patterns serve as the fundamental building blocks and a simplex noise field determines the direction of movement.\n\nclick || space => pause/unpause\n\nView all tr4ns4ctions at https://tr4ns4ctions.com\n\nKim Asendorf, 2022",

            "description": "It may appear as an indecipherable map to some. To others, it may present itself as a cross section of an underground cave. Or maybe an uncanny landscape of volcanic activity, a diagram of geological strata, or even something else entirely. Some vague structure may also appear; is it the remains of an ancient civilization? Or perhaps a glimpse into our own tomorrow?\n\nIn \"Agharta\", I sought to create a generative work that could invite the viewer to explore the depths of their imagination and uncover hidden structures within the seemingly chaotic composition. The idea came to me when I was exploring Simplex noise and pixel displacement in Cables. I was surprised by the emergent structures that appeared when some set of parameters paired with the right texture. \n\nThe title of the piece references the mythical underground world said to be located at the earth's core. This idea of hidden depths and secret worlds within the earth resonates with the abstract and enigmatic nature of the result generated by the noise. Imagery of landscape, vague structures, or geological features may appear but never stand out on its own; it exists in a state of constant flow and intersection as if viewed from another dimension. And just like the myth itself that bring up numerous theories that doesn’t necessarily connected to each other, it hints at that idea of an elusive imagined realm while never actually represent it completely.\n\n\n\n=========\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024px (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048px\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840px\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[Scroll/pinch] to zoom and drag to pan\n\n[r] or [zoom out to max] Reset position\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot of the current state at rendered resolution\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* This project use shaders that relies on GPU. Hi-res output may slow down your device. Since it also utilize GPU instance for thumbnail rendering, expect longer time for every iterations to be signed by fx(hash).\n\n* If 'glitching' occurs or the composition behaves differently at different resolution, just refresh the page to reset it (except for the thin lines, which are always drawn at approximately 1 pixel, so expect it to vary at different resolution).\n\nMade with cables.gl, a node-based webgl environment\n\nXALTED 2022",

            "description": "We cannot compose life, at best we hum along to the melodies that life has been played in front of us. Looking back at the scores of our lives, the notations are never neatly noted, but fully felt.  Rewinding the songs of life are our memories, whether sad, happy, angry, or melancholy. It is not clear whether I am dreaming or awake, but our songs all do end. \n\nIn this final drop (for ?), I have reused the first ever class calligraphy(){} I have written from my genesis drop “Nothing comes from nothing”. As time passes, 10 drops later, across almost to the year, I am grateful for the progress I have made, as an artist, and more importantly as a human. After all, what is behind the code of generative art is a human being. \n\nScores of music, scrolls of calligraphy, calendar or diary, notating life, time passes, and changes are inevitable. Sometimes we sing louder in laughter and joy, sometimes we scribble in uneasiness, sometimes we just get lost in neon lights. Life goes on. You and me, all the same and yet different.  \n\nThere are too many friend artists, friend collectors, fxhash team members, to thank for helping me through this journey. I would like to pay homage to Rudxane in this work, who has taken me under his wings, mentoring and encouraging me in art as well as showing me some degen stuff on the side:-). This homage is not copy-minting, or copying of styles, which I do not have the coding skills to do so even if I wanted to. But it is the influence of taste in many works of Rudxane. In a vague but agreeable taste, I present to you Life has no scores. \n\nWhat I was taught was disrupted, and grid studies left unfinished, and oh do we have a BINGO?\n\nTested on Chrome. Other browsers may render different or not at all (firefox)\n\nPress ‘2’ to save png.\n\nCopyright (©) 2022 Jimi Wen\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n",

In reality, algorithms can be simple. Very simple in fact.\n\nThis project, \"binary_trees\", uses a simple two step algorithm to search for a secret number. \n\nFor example, to find a secret number between 1 and 100 these are the steps:\nStep 1) Pick a number between the lowest number, 1, and the highest number, 100.  \nStep 2) If the picked number is higher than the secret number, set the new highest number to be the picked number.  \nOr, if the picked number is lower than the secret number, set the new lowest number to be the picked number.  \n\nRepeat Steps 1 and 2 until the secret number is found.\n\nbinary_trees repeats hundreds of these searches with each found secret number spawning new searches. Perlin noise, colour selections, arc widths and radii are used to bring a sense of structure to the visual output.\n\nMore detail about this project and early development renders can be found in the README.md, README.pdf and test_renders/ folder. \n\n\nFive Features \n---\n1. Aspect ratios:  \n- Landscape\n- Portrait\n- Square\n\n2. Seven colour palettes   \nThe colour palettes are adapted from Mark Rothko paintings as interpreted by Merritt Smith, https://github.com/mmerrittsmith/rothko.  \n\n3. Three Organizing Principle Ratios:\n- Super Golden Ratio\n- PHI\n- Golden Angle\n\n4. Number of search trees\n\n5. Maximum Search Space\nThis feature determines the size of the largest search space to find the secret number. \n\n\nInteraction\n---\nThis piece is dimension agnostic and can be exported to PNG format at several different sizes.\n\nThe outputs are not scaled but instead re-rendered at each of the dimensions listed below.\n\nPress t: thumbnail @ 200 x 200\nPress s: your current screen size\nPress p: print size @ 4800 x 4800 which is 16\"@300dpi\nPress h: HD4K on the vertical @ 2160 x 2160\nPress m: Max size @ 10800 x 10800\n\n\nAcknowledgements and #fxhashTurnsOne\n---\nbinary_trees is a (late) contribution to the first anniversary celebration for fxhash. I am very grateful to the developers/admins/organizers and the community that makes fxhash possible.\n\nA portion of the primary sales are split between the Processing Foundation and Tezos for Iran.\n\nAnd as always, none of this is possible without my family. Thank you the most to KIRH.\n\nLibraries Used for Development\n---\nMade with Processing / P5.js\np5.js v1.4.2 \n\n\nLicense info\n---\nSee LICENSE.md\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/",
