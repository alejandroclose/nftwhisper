It may take several seconds to produce a recognizable image, and several minutes to produce a high-quality render with no visible noise.\n\nCreated with webgl and clojurescript.\n\nControls:\n\nClick on the canvas to open a menu in the top right corner. In this menu you will see controls to capture a screenshot, adjust resolution, and adjust the camera, along with several other controls.\n\nWhen the \"optimized render\" option is checked, the page will compute an acceleration structure before rendering to allow the piece to converge much faster. With this option checked, the piece may need to process for up to a minute before rendering begins, but subsequently the rendering will proceed much more quickly than normal. This can be used to generate high-quality captures more quickly than when the option is not checked.\n\nWhen the \"filtering\" option is checked, a noise filter will be applied to the result of the render, reducing the appearance of noise.\n\nThe \"logic multiple\" slider can be used to multiply the amount of rendering work done each frame. Increasing this number may allow the piece to render more quickly, but may also make the page laggy. It is not recommended to increase this number unless you have a powerful GPU.",

A million thanks to the team. You are so appreciated as are the artists and collectors that have made this such a beautiful community. 🥂\n\nDefinitely check out “Forever” mode by tapping “F” or mouse click/tap — it will animate (you guessed it) forever and will change its layout every 365 frames, in honor of this wonderful year, and every year after. Some forever modes will “never forget” and others will fade as they progress. No idea if that’s a metaphor but it is a trait, that much I know.\n\nAll primary sales are donated to Code/Art, which is a charity that uses “…Art to Inspire Girls in Computer Science.” Read about Code/Art here: https://www.code-art.com/\n\nCeremony uses public domain art (which is the original, more implicit version CC0) made exclusively by women.\n\nSee fxtext article linked from the project page for a gallery of the source material and other notes.\n\nCeremony is also CC0, so feel free use anything here in other projects.\n\nYou can read more about CC0 here:\nhttps://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\n\nF : “Forever” mode (tap after initial render completes)\nP : Pause/Play\n(mouse click/tap also works to start “Forever” mode or Pause/Play)\n\nA : Add Grain (only works when paused in “Forever” mode.)\nG : Toggle Grain (resets the whole piece)\nM : Toggle Matte (resets the whole piece)\n\nS : Save Image\n1 -> 6 : Set pixel density (resets the whole piece)\n(Default pixel density is 1 @ 2000x2000)\n\nIf you want to start in \"Forever\" mode, you can append \"&forever=true\" to the url in the live view.\nYou can also add pixel density to the url by appending “&density=2” (or 3, 4, etc) to have it render at higher resolutions by default.",

There are 9 different color palettes, which may or may not be combined over the course of this linear work. \n\nThe artwork is designed to be contained within a rectangle, with the possibility of outbreaks as it edges towards the end. \n\nSegment begins, and it ends. The primary exploration happens in between. \n\n\nSegment is respondent to your viewport size. Reload browser to replay animation. ",

(...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

Blank-leaving is intentionally applied at various degrees throughout the series. The vast empty space beyond the plants is open to and embraces every kind of interpretation.\n\nZhu's outputs span hours of the day from dawn to dusk to night. Its color schemes explored four styles from traditional to modern. The simple yet complex senses and feelings reflected are surprisingly versatile.",
