Pollock's paintings are chaotically fractal and complex, whereas Mondrian's are simple, clean, and straight lines.\nAlthough Mondrian has always supported Pollock, their perspectives on abstract art are diametrically opposed.\nUnlike Mondrian, who spent weeks organizing his works, Pollock painted his canvases on the floor quickly and spontaneously.\nDespite significant differences in the creative process and method of execution, both artists saw their ultimate goal as reaching a level beyond life, which is only possible through the direct and profound aesthetic expression of nature.\nThe art world viewed both abstract forms at their peak with skepticism, unable to find a link between those works and the world he dealt with on a daily basis. \n Both forms of abstract art are considered modern masterpieces fifty years later.\nPollock's work demonstrates that the visual complexity of his paintings is founded on fractal patterns, which can be found in a wide range of natural objects.\nFurthermore, visual perception experiments conducted in collaboration with psychologists have revealed that fractal patterns have an aesthetic quality. \nFor the last fifty years, his work's precise concept of color rotation has been debated in art.\nAlthough Pollack always avoided commenting on his works, he mentioned somewhere that: My interest goes back to the rhythm of nature.\nThe visual complexity of fractal patterns necessitates the use of descriptive perspectives that are fundamentally at odds with traditional Euclidean geometry.\nThe fractal dimension is an important parameter in this category because it numerically represents the ascending fractal relationship between patterns observed in different unfolding trends.\nPollock's style can be described as fractal expressionism rather than computer-generated, emotionless art. Pollock drew complex patterns in nature 25 years before the scientific discovery of fractals and demonstrated the ability to directly create and manipulate fractal patterns.\nIn the \"Auroria\" collection, I presented a two-way view of modern art in opposition to classical art, using dark points, crossed lines, and fractal shapes that I drew in monochrome in the background in the works of artists such as Kandinsky, Miro, and Pollock, and I used them in the foreground in the works of artists such as Mondrian, Gerrit Rietveld in the Neo-plasticism movement.\nIn the background, I've discussed another aspect of this point of view, Mondrian, and so on, using geometrical forms and pre-determined and conventional graphic structures and compositions.\nThe point here is that foreground colors and lines take their identity from the background, fade into it, and colors sometimes find identity by passing through background spots, and their nature is determined by the same spots.\nThis means that throughout the history of art, all of these theories and deconstructions have evolved into modern art by following different art schools before them and developing a distinct identity, and they are now regarded as the sparks and examples of modern art. The birth certificate of art is a chain that connects each node.\nAnd this is an undeniable ratio that places the history of modern art behind the type of view and opinion that is either in favor of or against classical art. \n\n \"Auroria\" implies a focus on the beauty and complexity of light and color. The name is inspired by the natural light displays in the sky known as auroras, which are often associated with mystery and wonder. \nThis project uses 27 different color palettes and five different background colors with varying rarities for form and colors. \nMade in p5js\nCreated March 2023\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

The shapes slide under others, go out of view and reappear in an ever-changing canvas.\n\nOn a grid of 4 to 7 cells we place triangles, squares, and circles of different sizes. Their color and draw order are determined by their initial row placement. They move around freely inside the canvas indefinitely, showing a quasi-infinite number of combinations.\n\nThere are 10 possible colors, with 2 that are very rare that change the blend method to \"exclusion\" or \"difference\".\n\nCoded with p5js\n\nOriginal artwork by William Watkins · Lyon, 2021",

            "description": "Piet Mondrian's abstract paintings and Jackson Pollock's art are widely recognized as opposite ends of the modern art visual spectrum.\nWe all know that Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) and Jackson Pollock (1912-1956) had very different and opposing lives.\nMondrian's genius is found in the combination of patterned elements, resulting in a profound aesthetic that triumphantly emerges from absolute simplicity. Pollock's paintings are chaotically fractal and complex, whereas Mondrian's are simple, clean, and straight lines.\nAlthough Mondrian has always supported Pollock, their perspectives on abstract art are diametrically opposed.\nUnlike Mondrian, who spent weeks organizing his works, Pollock painted his canvases on the floor quickly and spontaneously.\nDespite significant differences in the creative process and method of execution, both artists saw their ultimate goal as reaching a level beyond life, which is only possible through the direct and profound aesthetic expression of nature.\nThe art world viewed both abstract forms at their peak with skepticism, unable to find a link between those works and the world he dealt with on a daily basis. \n Both forms of abstract art are considered modern masterpieces fifty years later.\nPollock's work demonstrates that the visual complexity of his paintings is founded on fractal patterns, which can be found in a wide range of natural objects.\nFurthermore, visual perception experiments conducted in collaboration with psychologists have revealed that fractal patterns have an aesthetic quality. \nFor the last fifty years, his work's precise concept of color rotation has been debated in art.\nAlthough Pollack always avoided commenting on his works, he mentioned somewhere that: My interest goes back to the rhythm of nature.\nThe visual complexity of fractal patterns necessitates the use of descriptive perspectives that are fundamentally at odds with traditional Euclidean geometry.\nThe fractal dimension is an important parameter in this category because it numerically represents the ascending fractal relationship between patterns observed in different unfolding trends.\nPollock's style can be described as fractal expressionism rather than computer-generated, emotionless art. Pollock drew complex patterns in nature 25 years before the scientific discovery of fractals and demonstrated the ability to directly create and manipulate fractal patterns.\nIn the \"Auroria\" collection, I presented a two-way view of modern art in opposition to classical art, using dark points, crossed lines, and fractal shapes that I drew in monochrome in the background in the works of artists such as Kandinsky, Miro, and Pollock, and I used them in the foreground in the works of artists such as Mondrian, Gerrit Rietveld in the Neo-plasticism movement.\nIn the background, I've discussed another aspect of this point of view, Mondrian, and so on, using geometrical forms and pre-determined and conventional graphic structures and compositions.\nThe point here is that foreground colors and lines take their identity from the background, fade into it, and colors sometimes find identity by passing through background spots, and their nature is determined by the same spots.\nThis means that throughout the history of art, all of these theories and deconstructions have evolved into modern art by following different art schools before them and developing a distinct identity, and they are now regarded as the sparks and examples of modern art. The birth certificate of art is a chain that connects each node.\nAnd this is an undeniable ratio that places the history of modern art behind the type of view and opinion that is either in favor of or against classical art. \n\n \"Auroria\" implies a focus on the beauty and complexity of light and color. The name is inspired by the natural light displays in the sky known as auroras, which are often associated with mystery and wonder. \nThis project uses 27 different color palettes and five different background colors with varying rarities for form and colors. \nMade in p5js\nCreated March 2023\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "Piet Mondrian's abstract paintings and Jackson Pollock's art are widely recognized as opposite ends of the modern art visual spectrum.\nWe all know that Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) and Jackson Pollock (1912-1956) had very different and opposing lives.\nMondrian's genius is found in the combination of patterned elements, resulting in a profound aesthetic that triumphantly emerges from absolute simplicity. Pollock's paintings are chaotically fractal and complex, whereas Mondrian's are simple, clean, and straight lines.\nAlthough Mondrian has always supported Pollock, their perspectives on abstract art are diametrically opposed.\nUnlike Mondrian, who spent weeks organizing his works, Pollock painted his canvases on the floor quickly and spontaneously.\nDespite significant differences in the creative process and method of execution, both artists saw their ultimate goal as reaching a level beyond life, which is only possible through the direct and profound aesthetic expression of nature.\nThe art world viewed both abstract forms at their peak with skepticism, unable to find a link between those works and the world he dealt with on a daily basis. \n Both forms of abstract art are considered modern masterpieces fifty years later.\nPollock's work demonstrates that the visual complexity of his paintings is founded on fractal patterns, which can be found in a wide range of natural objects.\nFurthermore, visual perception experiments conducted in collaboration with psychologists have revealed that fractal patterns have an aesthetic quality. \nFor the last fifty years, his work's precise concept of color rotation has been debated in art.\nAlthough Pollack always avoided commenting on his works, he mentioned somewhere that: My interest goes back to the rhythm of nature.\nThe visual complexity of fractal patterns necessitates the use of descriptive perspectives that are fundamentally at odds with traditional Euclidean geometry.\nThe fractal dimension is an important parameter in this category because it numerically represents the ascending fractal relationship between patterns observed in different unfolding trends.\nPollock's style can be described as fractal expressionism rather than computer-generated, emotionless art. Pollock drew complex patterns in nature 25 years before the scientific discovery of fractals and demonstrated the ability to directly create and manipulate fractal patterns.\nIn the \"Auroria\" collection, I presented a two-way view of modern art in opposition to classical art, using dark points, crossed lines, and fractal shapes that I drew in monochrome in the background in the works of artists such as Kandinsky, Miro, and Pollock, and I used them in the foreground in the works of artists such as Mondrian, Gerrit Rietveld in the Neo-plasticism movement.\nIn the background, I've discussed another aspect of this point of view, Mondrian, and so on, using geometrical forms and pre-determined and conventional graphic structures and compositions.\nThe point here is that foreground colors and lines take their identity from the background, fade into it, and colors sometimes find identity by passing through background spots, and their nature is determined by the same spots.\nThis means that throughout the history of art, all of these theories and deconstructions have evolved into modern art by following different art schools before them and developing a distinct identity, and they are now regarded as the sparks and examples of modern art. The birth certificate of art is a chain that connects each node.\nAnd this is an undeniable ratio that places the history of modern art behind the type of view and opinion that is either in favor of or against classical art. \n\n \"Auroria\" implies a focus on the beauty and complexity of light and color. The name is inspired by the natural light displays in the sky known as auroras, which are often associated with mystery and wonder. \nThis project uses 27 different color palettes and five different background colors with varying rarities for form and colors. \nMade in p5js\nCreated March 2023\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "Piet Mondrian's abstract paintings and Jackson Pollock's art are widely recognized as opposite ends of the modern art visual spectrum.\nWe all know that Piet Mondrian (1872-1944) and Jackson Pollock (1912-1956) had very different and opposing lives.\nMondrian's genius is found in the combination of patterned elements, resulting in a profound aesthetic that triumphantly emerges from absolute simplicity. Pollock's paintings are chaotically fractal and complex, whereas Mondrian's are simple, clean, and straight lines.\nAlthough Mondrian has always supported Pollock, their perspectives on abstract art are diametrically opposed.\nUnlike Mondrian, who spent weeks organizing his works, Pollock painted his canvases on the floor quickly and spontaneously.\nDespite significant differences in the creative process and method of execution, both artists saw their ultimate goal as reaching a level beyond life, which is only possible through the direct and profound aesthetic expression of nature.\nThe art world viewed both abstract forms at their peak with skepticism, unable to find a link between those works and the world he dealt with on a daily basis. \n Both forms of abstract art are considered modern masterpieces fifty years later.\nPollock's work demonstrates that the visual complexity of his paintings is founded on fractal patterns, which can be found in a wide range of natural objects.\nFurthermore, visual perception experiments conducted in collaboration with psychologists have revealed that fractal patterns have an aesthetic quality. \nFor the last fifty years, his work's precise concept of color rotation has been debated in art.\nAlthough Pollack always avoided commenting on his works, he mentioned somewhere that: My interest goes back to the rhythm of nature.\nThe visual complexity of fractal patterns necessitates the use of descriptive perspectives that are fundamentally at odds with traditional Euclidean geometry.\nThe fractal dimension is an important parameter in this category because it numerically represents the ascending fractal relationship between patterns observed in different unfolding trends.\nPollock's style can be described as fractal expressionism rather than computer-generated, emotionless art. Pollock drew complex patterns in nature 25 years before the scientific discovery of fractals and demonstrated the ability to directly create and manipulate fractal patterns.\nIn the \"Auroria\" collection, I presented a two-way view of modern art in opposition to classical art, using dark points, crossed lines, and fractal shapes that I drew in monochrome in the background in the works of artists such as Kandinsky, Miro, and Pollock, and I used them in the foreground in the works of artists such as Mondrian, Gerrit Rietveld in the Neo-plasticism movement.\nIn the background, I've discussed another aspect of this point of view, Mondrian, and so on, using geometrical forms and pre-determined and conventional graphic structures and compositions.\nThe point here is that foreground colors and lines take their identity from the background, fade into it, and colors sometimes find identity by passing through background spots, and their nature is determined by the same spots.\nThis means that throughout the history of art, all of these theories and deconstructions have evolved into modern art by following different art schools before them and developing a distinct identity, and they are now regarded as the sparks and examples of modern art. The birth certificate of art is a chain that connects each node.\nAnd this is an undeniable ratio that places the history of modern art behind the type of view and opinion that is either in favor of or against classical art. \n\n \"Auroria\" implies a focus on the beauty and complexity of light and color. The name is inspired by the natural light displays in the sky known as auroras, which are often associated with mystery and wonder. \nThis project uses 27 different color palettes and five different background colors with varying rarities for form and colors. \nMade in p5js\nCreated March 2023\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

Pollock drew complex patterns in nature 25 years before the scientific discovery of fractals and demonstrated the ability to directly create and manipulate fractal patterns.\nIn the \"Auroria\" collection, I presented a two-way view of modern art in opposition to classical art, using dark points, crossed lines, and fractal shapes that I drew in monochrome in the background in the works of artists such as Kandinsky, Miro, and Pollock, and I used them in the foreground in the works of artists such as Mondrian, Gerrit Rietveld in the Neo-plasticism movement.\nIn the background, I've discussed another aspect of this point of view, Mondrian, and so on, using geometrical forms and pre-determined and conventional graphic structures and compositions.\nThe point here is that foreground colors and lines take their identity from the background, fade into it, and colors sometimes find identity by passing through background spots, and their nature is determined by the same spots.\nThis means that throughout the history of art, all of these theories and deconstructions have evolved into modern art by following different art schools before them and developing a distinct identity, and they are now regarded as the sparks and examples of modern art. The birth certificate of art is a chain that connects each node.\nAnd this is an undeniable ratio that places the history of modern art behind the type of view and opinion that is either in favor of or against classical art. \n\n \"Auroria\" implies a focus on the beauty and complexity of light and color. The name is inspired by the natural light displays in the sky known as auroras, which are often associated with mystery and wonder. \nThis project uses 27 different color palettes and five different background colors with varying rarities for form and colors. \nMade in p5js\nCreated March 2023\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "🔥 BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY \"open edition\" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",
