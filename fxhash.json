The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature. Brought into existence via the blockchain, it is a new form of “token word poetry.”\n\n\nAs with the duo’s other poetry “unreadings,” all minters will receive an airdropped broadside of the full poem after all editions are collected. A 1/1 media-rich version of the entire poem will also be made available. \n \nPoetic traits:\n- 321 editions performed by the algorithm, out of billions of possible combinations\n- Each unique piece contains between 3 and 6 (out of 60) lines of generative text from a poem by Technelegy – a custom text generator fine-tuned on Stiles’ writing and research material, seeded with prompts from Stiles’ and Stern’s work – translated into binary and performed by Stiles\n- 24 possible binary backbeats performed by Stern in his “Nathaniel Fun Time” (NFT) stylings, and generatively re-mixed\n- 98 possible intros\n- 15 musical stems composed by Kris Bones, generating millions of possible mixes\n- Thousands of possible ending combinations \n- 5 fonts, layered in billions of potential ways, including Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer”\n- 13 color palettes based on Stern and Stiles’ respective artworka\n- Very rare attributes including music-less performance, poem-less music, repeated “B1nary 0de” (title only)\n\nClick to start and stop or replay. Although the first play through will be the same every time, starting and stopping may create minor variations in your mix (though not any of the core attributes).\n\n0RAL B1NARY: “BINARY ODE” was produced with partial support from Refraction DAO’s Creative Grants program, and premiered as part of Refraction Festival at Art Basel Miami 2022. 15% of primary sales go to Refraction, and 5% of primary sales will be donated to Black Girls Code.\n",

            "description": "Roll the dice with shapes and capture the moment!\nAlea, by the way, is Latin and means dice / gambling.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach Alea consists of 64 objects randomly arranged around a center and randomly differing in shape, texture, and movement. A curated 5 colors palette is picked and used for the textures. The colors are first sorted by saturation to select a reference color. With this, the colors are then sorted again by luminance.\n\nThe animation itself is 32 frames long and stops abruptly. It consists of 3 layers. The first layer moves the objects around the center and draws the animated objects. The second uses the first layer and a double buffer to capture the motion blur based on a depth mask. The third is mainly for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- shapes [7] (toruses, cubes, planes, toruses & cubes, toruses & planes, cubes & planes, toruses, cubes & planes)\n- palette [58] (based on German Max Magazine covers 1991 - 1995)\n- color sort direction [2] (up, down) - sort by saturation\n- color sort reference [3] (0, 1, 2) - used for sorting by luminance / background color\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 32 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar to trigger a spinning animation (or single click / tap)\n- `o` to trigger random object change animation followed by a rotation animation (or double click / tap)\n- `r` to trigger a random feature change followed by a random object change and rotation animation (or triple click / tap)\n- `k` to toggle this kiosk mode (off, 3, 5 or 10 secs)\n- `c` to capture an image\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- size=8000 - sets the base size for width/height to 8000px (default 3000, useful if you want to capture bigger pngs)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=5 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

Link at the bottom. If you’d rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

            "description": "This generator is named 'Ichigo' (苺/ いちご), the Japanese word for 'strawberry'. \n\nSeeing each iteration from a suitable distance, small dots (to me, reminiscent of strawberry seeds) overlay different sequences of geometric repetitions, implying a sense of texture, grittiness and irregularity. \n\nBy looking closer however, it becomes apparent to the viewer that the majority of the composition is in fact government by orderly elements, in this case grids of dots. \n\nThis discovery invites the viewer to consider the output in front of them at different levels, near and far. At what point do you feel the dots begin to dissolve into a texture? When do you stop noticing the dots and instead begin to perceive the overall composition?\n\nThese questions are posed in a similar fashion as with meditation; at what point does something become something else? When does an in-breath become an out-breath and vice versa? \n\nContemplation on simple questions like these can open a small portal into stillness and mindfulness by taking time to slowly observe our responses. \n\n23 palettes are included, each named after different areas of Tokyo. \n\nPress 'S' to download a full size 6000px x 6000px PNG output. \n\nAs always, much gratitude and enjoy your piece.

Changing and morphing over time to eventually reach its equilibrium.\n\nIt is a token where I try to symbolize the journey of life.\nWhere looking back is the best way to look forward.\nWhere looking into the future is not a possibility.\nWhere each day is as uncertain as the next.\n\nA token that will surprise you and have its ups and downs as it grows over time.\n\n\n\nPricing:\nDutch auction 64-16-8, where anybody that picks one up at 64 tez gets a print of how their galaxy looks on any day from the present to day 0. Meaning you can claim the print at any point in the future.\n\nThe print will be printed on high quality hahnemühle torchon paper at 30x40 cm (11.81 x 15.75 in). Printed at a local print shop here in Utrecht. This paper has a rough texture to it that matches the textures of space perfectly.\n\n\n\nUsage:\n- Hover over your Asterium to view the name, date, days passed, status and render stats.\n- Double press to export the current frame as a .png image.\n- Use the slider at the bottom to scroll back in time to the days before today, you can go as far back as day 0 and as far forwards as today.\n- The token refreshes every hour, so framing it in a digital picture frame is totally possible!\n\n",

That is the default Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ when switching \n  orientations\n\n  For animation:\n- Spacebar: toggle animation (on/off)\n- R: Reset the center of animation (if has been modified with click or drag)\n\nMOUSE:\n\n- Click (or Click & Drag) to set the center of animation\n\n----\nMade with p5js and custom shaders\n\n© Dec. 2022  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",
