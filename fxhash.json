            "description": "The first blueprint was found in 1947 on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.\nIt has been studied several times.\nNumerous theories arose trying to explain its origin.\nNone of them was decided conclusively.\n\nOne year ago, a rare group of waves coming from space was intercepted on earth.\nThis happened during the 2021 summer.\nIt was unclear if they were born from natural events.\nDying stars, black holes... Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n—--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n—--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n—--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022. Madrid - Cadiz. Spain.\nMade with p5.js",

            "description": "This is the second in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nThis work is a mark of progress. Christopher Scussel and I are working on modernizing MINI-EXPLOR. Chris is working on updating the engine from the original FORTRAN code of the 1970’s and its other limitations to usable JavaScript. In concert, I am analyzing and synthesizing the capabilities of the code and identifying an aesthetic. Together we continue to update EXPLOR and add new features.\n\nCPoSOP Composition is an original derivative work of Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids that was one of Knowlton’s original test examples. (Example 3)\n\nThe original EXPLOR picture frame was limited to a fixed array of 140 x 140 “characters.” Chris has rewritten the code to make the picture space variable. In this piece I increased the image space to a resolution 250 x 250  picture cells. Each picture cell is a 3x3 pixel block. \n\nThe EXPLOR functions are designed to interact with the current contents of each cell in the picture array. Every EXPLOR function has a rules parameter. In this test I’ve added a background. Thus when I draw my modified CPoSOP widget over the background it interacts with the color contents of a background cell or, the color of the cell based on a previously drawn widget.\n\nI’ve modified the original CPoSOP code and replaced constants with random variables. (made it a Spatial Force). I create a regular grid (Form of Spatial Organization) of a random size and draw the CPoSOP widget 85% of the time in one of the grid elements positions. The grid provides a structure to the image and the CPoSOP widget provides visual interest. The interaction of the widgets with the background and each other are amazing. \n\nIn keeping true to an EXPLOR vibe we use 4 color palettes. We let the computer randomly pick from three predefined palettes: Black and white. Four colors randomly chosen from set of 8 “Bauhaus” colors. And, four truly random colors.\n\nWe continue to honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT series. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored now updated by Scussel and Kolomyjec. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history with a modern twist.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "This is the second in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nThis work is a mark of progress. Christopher Scussel and I are working on modernizing MINI-EXPLOR. Chris is working on updating the engine from the original FORTRAN code of the 1970’s and its other limitations to usable JavaScript. In concert, I am analyzing and synthesizing the capabilities of the code and identifying an aesthetic. Together we continue to update EXPLOR and add new features.\n\nCPoSOP Composition is an original derivative work of Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids that was one of Knowlton’s original test examples. (Example 3)\n\nThe original EXPLOR picture frame was limited to a fixed array of 140 x 140 “characters.” Chris has rewritten the code to make the picture space variable. In this piece I increased the image space to a resolution 250 x 250  picture cells. Each picture cell is a 3x3 pixel block. \n\nThe EXPLOR functions are designed to interact with the current contents of each cell in the picture array. Every EXPLOR function has a rules parameter. In this test I’ve added a background. Thus when I draw my modified CPoSOP widget over the background it interacts with the color contents of a background cell or, the color of the cell based on a previously drawn widget.\n\nI’ve modified the original CPoSOP code and replaced constants with random variables. (made it a Spatial Force). I create a regular grid (Form of Spatial Organization) of a random size and draw the CPoSOP widget 85% of the time in one of the grid elements positions. The grid provides a structure to the image and the CPoSOP widget provides visual interest. The interaction of the widgets with the background and each other are amazing. \n\nIn keeping true to an EXPLOR vibe we use 4 color palettes. We let the computer randomly pick from three predefined palettes: Black and white. Four colors randomly chosen from set of 8 “Bauhaus” colors. And, four truly random colors.\n\nWe continue to honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT series. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored now updated by Scussel and Kolomyjec. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history with a modern twist.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "The first blueprint was found in 1947 on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.\nIt has been studied several times.\nNumerous theories arose trying to explain its origin.\nNone of them was decided conclusively.\n\nOne year ago, a rare group of waves coming from space was intercepted on earth.\nThis happened during the 2021 summer.\nIt was unclear if they were born from natural events.\nDying stars, black holes... Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n—--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n—--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n—--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022.

They are portals opening our view to rich content.\n\nThis work is a portal to itself. It loads itself within itself 20 times. It's not pretty, it reminds us of WordArt, it's a little bit hacky, it might break when our tools to display HTML will change. But it's a proof that the limits of our tools are only limits until creativity breaks them.\n\nThis work is not purely deterministic, because it simply cannot be. Slight timing differences due to loading times being different each time an <iframe> is loaded will make each visualization slightly unique.\n\nIf you view this token on mobile, the nesting limit was reduced to 4 to prevent performance issues.\n\nThis work is highly experimental. It leverages a \"hack\" to allow iframes to be nested.\nFirefox max <iframe> nesting depth as of 28/12/2021 is capped at 9.\nWorks with chrome desktop 96.0.4664.110",
