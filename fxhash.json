            "description": "There’s beauty in simple things. Sunlight. A reflection on a puddle. The flight of a bird. Observing the clouds. Spending time with loved ones.\n\nTo celebrate the re-opening of fxhash, I'd like to contribute with some simple thing to enjoy among friends who rejoin after some time.\n\nSimple things is a piece that is just that: simple things. Nothing fancy here. Simple circles doing simple movement, with simple colours. Maybe the viewer will rejoice in observing them transit on the screen.\n\nIt has some controls: you can press “s” to save a png file. You can set a higher resolution pressing “d” followed by 1-9 to increase pixel density (if you get a black image, press “d 0” and start again with a lower number). Simple controls.\n\nIt has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n\nThe pieces exhibit simple variations: palettes, circle sizes, density of elements, backgrounds. The colours might be inverted sometimes. The direction of the movement changes also in some pieces. Some are grayscale pieces.\n\nJust like in life, enjoying simple things is sometimes enough to leave behind the noise and our worries. Also like in life, if one wants something extra, they may get it by looking for it...\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade in p5.js, and glsl for the image controls.",

By taking a moment to open ourselves up, these swirling worlds of weightless and seemingly infinite brush strokes invite us to slow down and dwell in prismatic intuitive swells.\n\nIn doing so, we may find the immense and omnipresent love that needs only our awareness to be felt.\n\n__________\n\nPress 1-9 to load at different scales (1 = 2,000x2,000 (default), 9 = 10,000x10,000)\nWhen zoomed in, once the output is fully loaded, you can click and drag to move around the canvas\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'B' to toggle the background texture on or off\nPress 'A' to toggle the loading animation (recommended for very large scales)\n\nCreated with p5.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n__________\nTENDER x teaboswell\nMay 2022",

And while we devise systems for solving unfathomably complex problems, generating algorithmic creativity, and unlocking regenerative biological possibilities, we simultaneously cling to the power and originality of emotional feeling – believing it to be the irreplaceable source of what makes us human.\n\nIf the body is our shell for emotion and soul, can an artificial humanoid be another vessel for these thoughts and feelings – for human essence itself? If our ‘soul’ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable? That we may see answers to these questions looks more real every year, and is perhaps a little frightening. \n\nEmotional Shell uses introspective portraits of future selves to question what it means to be human, when the people around us are no longer human.\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 1-3 to select from low, medium, and high quality settings\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2400px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nTENDER x wwatkns\nAugust 2022",

            "description": "Back when I was a researcher at a human-computer interaction lab, I parked in the adjacent neighborhood and rode the city bus into campus.\n\nUsually this was a pretty uneventful affair.\n\nOne spring day though, the bus was packed and I had to stand right up front by the driver. Despite trying to appear busy enough not to be bothered, the driver struck up a conversation.\n\nAt some point in the short trip, we stopped at a red light. It was then that he made an off-hand comment that I've remembered ever since.\n\n“The moment between when the light turns green and when I realize it, that’s where my soul resides.”\n\nI’m not sure how you’re supposed to respond to that. But nevertheless it smacked me.\n\nSo: do not consider each of these my personal signature as an artist, developer, and tinkerer.\n\nDo consider them an expended shard of my soul and the culmination of experiences that have led up to this moment.\n\nThis is the light turning green.\n\n---\n\nTHIS TOKEN IS A RESERVE PASS (it’s ✨special✨)\n\n- This token will function as a reserve pass for any future drop on fx(hash) that has a total edition size of > 100 (ie, most of my drops, other than dedicated “sketch” projects that may have intentionally fewer editions)\n\n- Future reserves will be limited to holders of this token, and holding this token will guarantee you a dedicated 24 hour reserve spot on such projects.\n\n- Holding any token from my prior projects will make you eligible to mint from this drop (I will take a final snapshot ~1 hr prior to drop).\n\n- I have created an edition size of 60, but only 40 will be open for minting at this time. I’ll reserve the remainder for issuing or burning at my discretion.\n\n- I will also airdrop ~9 editions to the top collectors of my previous projects (consider Twitter to be the source of info on this prior to the drop)\n\nWHY?\n\nI don’t like the idea of picking and choosing who gets a reserve and who doesn’t.\n\nI love you all 🙏\n\n---\n\n- Made with p5JS\n- Press “s” to save png",

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.

They are portals opening our view to rich content.\n\nThis work is a portal to itself. It loads itself within itself 20 times. It's not pretty, it reminds us of WordArt, it's a little bit hacky, it might break when our tools to display HTML will change. But it's a proof that the limits of our tools are only limits until creativity breaks them.\n\nThis work is not purely deterministic, because it simply cannot be. Slight timing differences due to loading times being different each time an <iframe> is loaded will make each visualization slightly unique.\n\nIf you view this token on mobile, the nesting limit was reduced to 4 to prevent performance issues.\n\nThis work is highly experimental. It leverages a \"hack\" to allow iframes to be nested.\nFirefox max <iframe> nesting depth as of 28/12/2021 is capped at 9.\nWorks with chrome desktop 96.0.4664.110",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "aRo \"a Representation of\"\n\nLike a ladder or a hammer, art is often a tool. The less practical and most bizarre, basically the most overcomplicated self-made tool anyone could ever imagine. But it's THE tool to explore ideas.\nI created this one to investigate, to poke and nudge at a few concepts that seem to go hand-in-hand.\nFirstly, Representation, as in changing something to better explain it. Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.\n\nWhile many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.\n\nBut there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.\n\nI can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.\n\nWhat happens when a flower has more petals than pixels? Why do we know there's more layers to that thumbnail?\nMy best answer is:\n\n--Press \"s\" key to save a bigger image (2400x3200 px)\n",
