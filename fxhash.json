Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

These plots are then drawn over with varying, incremented pixel brushes.\n\nAUTOJOURNEYPAINT chooses color for itself from a broad list of more than 100 colors. It selects a palette of 8 but might not use all of them.\n\nThe background consists of a single color at the back and then one channel (either r, g, b) of the same color iterating from 0 to 255 while also iterating over a number of pixels within a border, all fixed to a pixel grid of variable size. The iteration over pixel numbers means the background produces very different patterns at different screen sizes\n\nIf you want to know more about the variables used they are output in the console log\n\nResponsive to screen size. Larger resolutions will implement more brush strokes.\n\nSome renders may be slower due to more complex collision detection in some brush settings.\n\nPress “s” to save the image as a png.",

Link at the bottom. If you’d rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

If you’d rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

            "description": "An automatic painting journey\n\nAUTOJOURNEYPAINT  uses a series of custom built walkers to make plots with a great variety of properties, including packing gaps, directions and propensity for turning. These plots are then drawn over with varying, incremented pixel brushes.\n\nAUTOJOURNEYPAINT chooses color for itself from a broad list of more than 100 colors. It selects a palette of 8 but might not use all of them.\n\nThe background consists of a single color at the back and then one channel (either r, g, b) of the same color iterating from 0 to 255 while also iterating over a number of pixels within a border, all fixed to a pixel grid of variable size. The iteration over pixel numbers means the background produces very different patterns at different screen sizes\n\nIf you want to know more about the variables used they are output in the console log\n\nResponsive to screen size. Larger resolutions will implement more brush strokes.\n\nSome renders may be slower due to more complex collision detection in some brush settings.\n\nPress “s” to save the image as a png.",
