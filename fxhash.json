            "description": "\"Naïf\": An Introspection on Naivety\n\nFrom childhood, naivety is perceived as innate. It embodies a form of purity, an absence of experience that could have altered its original essence. In young adults or adults, especially in our productivity-focused societies, naivety is often seen as a weakness, a dysfunction, or even an exploitable incompetence, subject to mockery. As if the hardening process, deemed necessary to make an individual apt and conforming, had not operated satisfactorily.\n\nHowever, it is paradoxical to note that literature, as well as our personal experiences, are filled with examples where an adult's naivety is a strength, a means to overcome and transcend numerous obstacles. It's also a choice, conscious or unconscious, to apply a filter to the reality we observe and engage in.\n\nWith advanced age, there is often a return to this naivety, a rediscovery of that lost innocence. In the elderly, this quality becomes, in a way, normal and even desirable, especially when it doesn't stem from illnesses. It reflects a form of wisdom and resilience in the face of life's complexity, a way to lighten oneself before departure.\n\nStarted with doors attached to an unfinished perspective, this project became quite obsessive until revealing a meaning that I perceived as this introspection on naivety. Between art therapy and personal reflection, this work is a journey in which I visually experimented with some of my convictions that I, along the way, deconstructed.\n\nTo materialize this reflection, I designed a simple drawing, naively representing a set of celestial bodies and birds through cognitive doors. These doors, fixed on a stable structure without alteration, rest on a uniform background with a slight grain.\n\nFrom this original view, I then revisited each element, altering them individually before recombining them. Constructing a background of simple objects, books, and childish patterns. I added a ground and clouds to anchor this confrontation to the terrestrial. The doors combine, opening to a broader vision while reducing the number of viewpoints. The structure is distorted, dissonant, resonant, colorful, sometimes overly so, even amplified, mirroring our personal structures constantly changing and confronted by life. The doors merge, increasing the surfaces and reducing the viewpoints. The birds have changed, the celestial bodies have moved, becoming denser, taking up more space, colliding, and tearing apart. Transparency emerged, allowing a glimpse of the entirety through our own doors. The reflections of different plans connect.\n\nFrom anarchic coloring, the lines are immature, the encounters are random. This choice reflects again the desire to preserve the dissonance induced by certain encounters and the space they occupy in our internal mechanics.\n\nThis approach produced an image oscillating between disharmony and interest; sometimes pleasant, sometimes less so, even hostile or incomprehensible.\n\nThis project, in its execution, is entirely random. It was created using the p5.js, p5.noise, and chroma.js libraries.\n\nThe \"S\" key saves the three created images.",

            "description": "\"Naïf\": An Introspection on Naivety\n\nFrom childhood, naivety is perceived as innate. It embodies a form of purity, an absence of experience that could have altered its original essence. In young adults or adults, especially in our productivity-focused societies, naivety is often seen as a weakness, a dysfunction, or even an exploitable incompetence, subject to mockery. As if the hardening process, deemed necessary to make an individual apt and conforming, had not operated satisfactorily.\n\nHowever, it is paradoxical to note that literature, as well as our personal experiences, are filled with examples where an adult's naivety is a strength, a means to overcome and transcend numerous obstacles. It's also a choice, conscious or unconscious, to apply a filter to the reality we observe and engage in.\n\nWith advanced age, there is often a return to this naivety, a rediscovery of that lost innocence. In the elderly, this quality becomes, in a way, normal and even desirable, especially when it doesn't stem from illnesses. It reflects a form of wisdom and resilience in the face of life's complexity, a way to lighten oneself before departure.\n\nStarted with doors attached to an unfinished perspective, this project became quite obsessive until revealing a meaning that I perceived as this introspection on naivety. Between art therapy and personal reflection, this work is a journey in which I visually experimented with some of my convictions that I, along the way, deconstructed.\n\nTo materialize this reflection, I designed a simple drawing, naively representing a set of celestial bodies and birds through cognitive doors. These doors, fixed on a stable structure without alteration, rest on a uniform background with a slight grain.\n\nFrom this original view, I then revisited each element, altering them individually before recombining them. Constructing a background of simple objects, books, and childish patterns. I added a ground and clouds to anchor this confrontation to the terrestrial. The doors combine, opening to a broader vision while reducing the number of viewpoints. The structure is distorted, dissonant, resonant, colorful, sometimes overly so, even amplified, mirroring our personal structures constantly changing and confronted by life. The doors merge, increasing the surfaces and reducing the viewpoints. The birds have changed, the celestial bodies have moved, becoming denser, taking up more space, colliding, and tearing apart. Transparency emerged, allowing a glimpse of the entirety through our own doors. The reflections of different plans connect.\n\nFrom anarchic coloring, the lines are immature, the encounters are random. This choice reflects again the desire to preserve the dissonance induced by certain encounters and the space they occupy in our internal mechanics.\n\nThis approach produced an image oscillating between disharmony and interest; sometimes pleasant, sometimes less so, even hostile or incomprehensible.\n\nThis project, in its execution, is entirely random. It was created using the p5.js, p5.noise, and chroma.js libraries.\n\nThe \"S\" key saves the three created images.",

Move the parameters freely to create your designs.\n\nHowever, completion is short-lived.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, the copies multiply repeatedly.\n\nModifications, alterations, and revisions are applied to the objects.\n\nConcurrently, the paper's decay and replication-induced noise compound on the drawing's surface.\n\nThis process repeats, archives, and...\n\nThe drawing becomes progressively more challenging to decipher.\n\nRandomized years of passage are set.\n\nThe longer the passage, the lengthier the animation, and the more effects overlap on the drawing. Enjoy the evolving animation.\n\nVertical lines flow from left to right throughout the animation.\n\nEach second represents a fictional decay of 10 years, and the year markings regress.\n\nOrigin and Creation of the Artwork:\n\nCurrently involved in the field of architecture, I've come across numerous old architectural drawings. These often prove difficult to interpret due to the obscurity caused by dirt and noise when compared to contemporary blueprints.\n\nWhile deciphering these intricate drawings, the idea emerged to represent the unique replication noise of copiers. Additionally, there's a fondness for the inherent aging of paper, which imparts a sense of history. Drawings that have been cherished and preserved for years progressively deteriorate due to fading and dirt.\n\nI aimed to combine the vintage deterioration seen in old maps and books with the noise generated by machines, creating an effect function.\n\nThe effects encompass both machine noise and aging noise.\n\nFor stochastic noise, I designed functions based on the same principles as actual photocopying. Colors are obtained from the original layer, slight discrepancies in position and color are introduced, and the color is redrawn.\n\nFor aging noise, I incorporated effects simulating wetting and drying of paper, hole formation, rust stains, and more.\n\nPress the 's' key to save the animation as a PNG.\n\nDue to being a beginner, there might be occasional malfunctions in parameters or hash values, and I appreciate your understanding.\n\nPlease share many of your original objects! With gratitude, I'll mix them all up:)\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\nFurthermore, I express gratitude to fxhash for allowing me to artistically manifest such ideas and share them with everyone.\n\nAlso, from my early years, I've always admired my father, who used to pore over blueprints. I think I created this work because I aspire to be like him.\n\n劣華-Rekka- について、\n\n\nこのアニメーション作品は、紙の複写ノイズと経年劣化がテーマです。\n\nコピーを重ねて生じるノイズ、紙そのものの風化や劣化が図面の内容や詳細が次第に見え難くなっていく様子を表現したアニメーション絵画作品です。\n\nあらゆるノイズエフェクトによってオリジナル状態が、\n複雑なビジュアルに書き換えられます。\n\nparamにてオリジナルの図形を描いてみてください。\nオブジェクトは、円、線、寸法線など。パラーメーターを自由に動かしてみてください。\n\n完成したのも束の間。\n\n数秒後にはコピーが何回も繰り返されます。\n\nオブジェクトに対し改変、変更、修正案が加えられます。\nそれと同時に紙の劣化、複写によるノイズが重ねて図面上に記録されてしまいます。\n\n\nそれがまた複写され、保存され、、、\nどんどん図面は解読が困難になっていきます。\n\nランダムに経過年数が設定されます。\n\n経過年数が長いほど、アニメーション時間は長くなります。\nその分図面上で起こるエフェクトは多く重なり合います。\nその変わりゆくアニメーションをお楽しみください。\n\nアニメーション中は縦線が左から右へと流れていきます。\n\n一秒毎に10年の劣化をフィクション値とし、年号が遡っていきます。\n\n-創案と経緯-\n\n私自身、現在、建築関係に携わっています。\nその中で、古い建築図の見る事があるのですが、\n現行の図面に比べて、汚れやノイズで見えづらい事が多々あります。\n\nそのような難解な図面を解読しているうちに、コピー機独特の複写ノイズを表現したいと考えました。\n\nまた、紙本来の経年劣化に、歴史を感じる愛おしさがありました。\n長年にわたって大切に保管された図面は原型を留めながらも、\nくすみや、汚れによって劣化していきます。\n\n古地図や古書に感じるビンテージな劣化と、\n機械的に生じたノイズの混同を表現できたらとエフェクト関数を制作していきました。\n\nエフェクトには、機械系ノイズと、劣化系ノイズがあります。\n\n機会的なノイズは、実際のコピーと同じ原理の関数を作りました。\nオリジナルレイヤーの色を取得し、元の位置と誤差を生じさせて、色を再度描画する。\n\n劣化ノイズでは、紙が濡れて乾いたような表現、穴が空くエフェクト、錆汚れ等。\n\n\"s\"キーPNG保存可能です。\n\nビギナーの為、パラメータやハッシュ値に誤動作がある可能性がありますがご了承ください。\n\n是非みなさんのたくさんのオリジナルオブジェクトを見せてください！！\n感謝をこめてぐちゃぐちゃにします:)\n\n\n楽しんでいただけると幸いです。",

It is characterized by simplicity and minimalism, and I focused on using clean and precise lines to convey shapes, forms, and textures. Also emphasized outlines, color palettes, and subject lines rather than shadows to create a more substantial visual impact.\nI expressed this idea through lines with simplicity and clarity to leave room for interpretation by the viewer. One of the advantages of line art is its versatility. I combined lines with geometric shapes to add depth and texture to the image. \nOverall, I tried to offer a unique way of expressing creativity by focusing on clean lines and minimal aesthetics, and I believe that lines can have an eternal charm that will continue to captivate audiences in various artistic media such as digital art.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

Give it a try!\n\nWhen I was young, It was intimidating to think about space because it was endless. I felt like I'm completely dissolving in it and turning into zero.\n\nI was getting older and exploring the world around me. What seemed large and complex turned out to be the result of the interaction of simple elements. Even the infinite Universe can be decomposed and understood.\n\n“Zero-player game” is a cellular automaton through which I explore the concept of infinity and emergence. The game starts with a surface covered by random cells. Over six iterations the image becomes more complex as the cells divide and change their colors according to a set of thirty two rules.\n\nMore information about the project at https://ivandianov.com/zero-player-game/\n\n- Swipe or use arrow keys to navigate.\n- Add ?lat=100500&lon=100500 to URL and teleport to a distant location.\n- Press “S” to save a picture.",

            "description": "Colour streaks refer to vibrant and bold streaks of different colors, which involve creating vibrant and dynamic combinations using streaks or lines of different colors. Characterized by their bold and energetic appearance, colors are often combined and layered to create a sense of movement and depth.\nDifferent techniques are usually used to apply colors on canvas or paper. This can include brush strokes, palette knives, or even pouring paint directly onto the surface. Colors are usually applied in long, flowing strokes, creating a sense of flow and rhythm.\nColors have a great influence on the mood and overall effect of the artwork. I chose complementary colors to create contrast and visual interest, and similar colors for a more harmonious and relaxing effect.\nOne of the key aspects of colour streaks is their ability to evoke emotion and stimulate the viewer's imagination. Vibrant colors and dynamic combinations often evoke feelings of joy, energy, or excitement. Flowing lines and color combinations can also create a sense of movement or evoke natural elements such as water or wind.\nOverall, colour streaks are a visually appealing form of abstract expression that celebrates the beauty and power of color. They invite viewers to immerse themselves in their vibrant world and interpret their meaning based on their own perceptions and feelings.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",
