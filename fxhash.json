            "description": "Primarily, I use lines to create images or designs. It is characterized by simplicity and minimalism, and I focused on using clean and precise lines to convey shapes, forms, and textures. Also emphasized outlines, color palettes, and subject lines rather than shadows to create a more substantial visual impact.\nI expressed this idea through lines with simplicity and clarity to leave room for interpretation by the viewer. One of the advantages of line art is its versatility. I combined lines with geometric shapes to add depth and texture to the image. \nOverall, I tried to offer a unique way of expressing creativity by focusing on clean lines and minimal aesthetics, and I believe that lines can have an eternal charm that will continue to captivate audiences in various artistic media such as digital art.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "September Mond is the fourth series of about 10 different tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years and will be released here on fxhash over the next time (i think untill end of 2024).\n\nIt will be released on the occasion of the 'blue supermoon' — the biggest and brightest full moon of the year.\nhttps://www.livescience.com/space/the-moon/rare-blue-supermoon-the-biggest-and-brightest-full-moon-of-the-year-rises-aug-30\n\nThis project explores a minimalist approach to tree naturalism using a recursive algorithm and includes two traits: a density layer of trees, a for the size of the moon.\n\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png.\n\nArtist notes:\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\nSitting under acacia trees in some full moon warm summer nights inspired the \"September Mond\" work.\n\nProject link: http://lumicon.de/e-art/project/septembermond/\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND\n",

            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac. In case the site crashes, close all other applications and retry. If you’re not able to render in 12K on your device, please get in touch (@pxlshrd on Social Media and Discord).\n\nPlease note:\n- The Adaptive mode has a slightly altered appearance compared to the default aspect ratio.\n\n- The code was tested on Mac Apple Silicon/Windows/iOS/iPadOS with consistent and pixel-perfect results throughout.\n\n- The live view on Android devices slightly deviates from those on the systems mentioned above.\n\n/////\n\nCreated with p5.js and GLSL shaders.",

            "description": "Energy is everywhere: it’s moving our bodies, buzzing around a city, growing the universe, and connecting everything within it. Perhaps the strongest symbol humans use for energy – for ideas, life, and the various incarnations of power – is light itself. \n\nFor centuries, each form of art has tried to capture the energetic luminescence of a bright light, a warm glow, a spark... if we could only draw with its pure brilliance! From Caravaggio’s diagonal beams, to Picasso drawing with light across Gjon Mili’s photographic emulsions… this pursuit persists through obsessive efforts by artists of every media. \n\na fortiori seeks to capture this power of light with code, output on the native illumination of modern screens. The visual deconstruction of light and its reassembly into a frozen moment produces the tangible shards of each spark – resulting in a sum of marks that exceeds the value of their individual parts. It’s then the obsessive energy of generative art’s looping and controlled randomness that enable its repeated mark making, of all types, to express the nearly-intangible intensity of light.\n\nWhat one hand might communicate in drawing, with light or stick or keyboard, 100 hands would therefore say 100 times louder, clearer, and more impactfully. And if one could capture the authentic energy of traveling light in a single image, it stands to reason that 500 of these images will multiply their energy-inducing qualities together, and exponentially grow their collective power. In this idea, the medium is the message – proving the power of the medium, and its ability to generate energy.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x Thomas Noya\nDecember 2022\n\nSource code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\na fortiori was created in p5.js and is optimized for live output in Chrome.

Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac.
