            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke.\n100% of the proceeds from primary sales are donated to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke. \nhttps://www.tribute-hwf.com/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUndisputably, my mathematical background makes me naturally attracted to graphs, math functions, and transformations. I use math in ways that mathematicians could consider nonsense, but which produce fascinating aesthetic elements for creation (to paraphrase Herbert W. Franke). Combining scientific symbols and illustrations with fictional data produces pseudo-persuasive generative imagery that we can easily take to be absolute truth or in which we find meaningful patterns.\nIn the special issue of Leonardo, Visual Mathematics from 1992, Herbert W. Franke and Horst S. Helbig published the article Generative Mathematics: Mathematically Described and Calculated Visual Art.\n\nThey propose that “Through the use of [mathematical] formulas (software) we gain generative principles. Beyond formal descriptions, we obtain guides for the construction of images. For example, if we use a parametric representation of a curve, the result is similar to traditional methods of drawing and painting […]“ Additionally, mathematics removes frame limits and adds the possibilities for transitions, transformations, movement, and interaction by implementing simple changes to the defining parameters.\n\nI’m also very fond of the analysis and comparison (mentioned there) of digitally generated images and Constructivist design. Limitations of the technology (in the 70s) allowed only simple line drawings, based on fixed proportions same as Constructivists did. “In a short time, all possible features were exhausted, so it became an obvious goal to try to extend them. This was done first by the use of random generators — a highly interesting expansion of design principles […]” Another expansion happened by adding curved shapes, first simple then complex that overcame possibilities of drawing with compasses and rulers. “[…] oscillating curves are easily obtained through mathematical formulas and computer-graphic systems. The results we achieve on this basis do not look like Constructivist presentations, but their rationality and precision derive from Constructivist principles. ”\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nEach mint contains both dark and light version, use D/N keys to switch between “day & night”.\n \nBase shapes are circles or Lissajous curves modified by the noise function. Shapes are arranged in a grid or by a circle packing algorithm. Lines are drawn smoothly or in stripes. Around 20% of the mints have lines in only one color (black/white). \n\nDepending on the browser/configuration rendering times will vary. \n",

            "description": "Our vision is to create meaningful generative artworks that express human sentiments about their social experiences.\n\nWe’re currently focused on experiences centered around celebration, and we’ve chosen a theme that connects people through music.\nMusic has the power to evoke a wide range of emotions within us, especially when experienced through a collective experience.\n\nWe wanted to generate an artistic script that visually captures these expressions. \n\nOur first music NFT collection reflects human sentiments towards Tomorrowland 2022. \nIt's a creative collaboration with dahleea, an artist dedicated to colors, who gave us the inspiration for the visuals you are seeing through one of her beautiful and colorful artworks.\n\nCoding, music, and art collide to recreate emotions expressed by people coming together from all over the world to share music and connection at one of the world’s leading music festivals. \n\nThe creative process:\n\nData was collected via emotion analysis using Twitter’s API. Our data is derived from emotion analysis models to extract the emotion scores (Happiness, Anger, Sadness, Fear, and Surprise) from 105,762 tweets, written in English, and containing mention of ‘Tomorrowland' between July 15, 2022, to August 8, 2022. \n\nOur analysis demonstrated the following emotions:\n\nHappiness: 38%\nAnger 8%\nSadness: 26%\nFear: 28%\n\nMusic:\n\nIn Pillars of Tomorrow, there are 4 instruments: bass, piano, percussion (hi-hat, kick, snare, claps, fx sounds), and a quiet pad. All the rhythms are self-written using Ableton, exported, and randomly selected to create the backbone of our generative music NFT.\n\nThis music piece has 4 different parts (basic, drop, break, after-drop) which are looped 3 times. All parts include different rhythm variations which are chosen randomly. \n\nThe generative harmony is present in the basic and after-drop parts. The key to generating harmony is using the emotion percentages above as possibilities for the next piano chord and melody to sound happy or sad.  \nWe chose to distort our bass sound according to anger trait values, as distortion can turn a mild bass into an aggressive one. \n\nFinally, there is also an emotion of surprise, which is associated with a special background and the sound of bells ringing.  The surprise element trait of the mints will be revealed after the Pillars of Tomorrow collection is fully minted.\n\nWe wanted to make a dynamic collection that would give you the feeling of a live music event, an interactive experience. A big stage flowing with music and diverse human expressions.\n\nc-camera start/stop\np pause (or play)\n\nspace (play/stop)\n\nl (change where the camera look)\n\nArrow Up (View pillars from above)\nArrow down (go to starting position)\nArrow left/right (camera moving direction)\n\nAWSD work as arrows as well\nscroll (Zoom In/Out)\n\nenter (screenshot)\n\nFor an optimal experience, we recommend using Google Chrome.\n\n#CodingIsArt\n\n",

            "description": "'Chimalmat Relics' is a generative art project that pays homage to the great American civilizations (such as the Aztecs, the Mayans and the Incas).\n\nEach piece of the project has 4 stages. \n\nThe first is the expansion, the flourishing, the formation of the cities. In this stage each work begins to grow. The lines evoke the complexity of the cultures and how they progressed, occupying more land, becoming more intricate, complex, beautiful and elaborate. The circles represent the individuals of these cultures, they are large because they represent the greatness of these individuals. The squares represent the temples, so important to these societies.\n\nThe next stage is maturation, it is when lines begin to appear in the background that cover the entire piece and represent the acquired knowledge and wisdom of these cultures, their knowledge of nature, the stars, their art.\n\nThe third stage is decadence, we already know what happened to these civilizations, so this stage enters like a wave from the left that sweeps everything away, erases and blurs the work, the history. It represents the conquest.\n\nThe last stage represents history, memory, what survives today, what we can reconstruct, infer, yearn for those times, there is much that was lost, but the essence remains, it is still there. It allows us and obliges us in a certain way to contemplate and appreciate it.\n\n-----\n\nPress 'e' to export a PNG\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr 2022.\n\nMade with P5js and <3.",

            "description": "“Ordinary Places” is a fully-coded meditation on the poetic beauty of everyday landscapes. \n\nThe architectural characters in these landscapes include water towers (inspired by Bernd & Hilla Becher’s “Water Tower” photography series), gas stations (inspired by Ed Ruscha’s “26 Gasoline Stations” photography book), and barns (inspired by childhood memories on my grandfather’s farm). \n\nYet, while these scenes may seem ordinary upon first glance, something darker lurks beneath the surface. The hidden secrets of these Ordinary Places can only be revealed through the minting process. In this sense, the outputs are not merely a collection individual scenes, but instead, a coherent world animated by shared themes and narratives.     \n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",

Sometimes they are hard to forget, sometimes they are easy to remember.\n\nMemories are easily interrupted or even fractured, but they are also mostly always connected with other memories, whether they are related or not.\n\nForgotten Memories is what I consider to be my most ambitious study of color harmony yet. Each color represents a different category of memory, which are stored in our mind in layers of time. Their shapes differ in width and length depending on how weak/strong the memory was and how long it lasted.\n\nOnce a memory is forgotten, it may or may never be remembered again. But one thing that is not to be forgotten is that whether we choose to forget or remember, we are made of our memories.\n\n* * *\n\nPress S to save as PNG.\nPress 1 to save with 1000px height.\nPress 2 to save with 2000px height.\n\nMade by: yenren / twitter.com/yenrenART\nLicense: LICENSE.txt",
