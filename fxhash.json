            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution.

            "description": "\"A mille-feuille (French pronunciation: ​[mil fœj], \"thousand-sheets\"), also known by the names Napoleon, vanilla slice, and custard slice, is a dessert made of puff pastry layered with pastry cream. Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.\n\nTraditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry (pâte feuilletée), alternating with two layers of pastry cream (crème pâtissière). The top pastry layer is finished in various ways: sometimes it is topped with whipped cream, or it may be dusted with icing sugar, cocoa, pastry crumbs, or sliced almonds. It may also be glazed with icing or fondant alone, or in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) or other colored icing stripes, and combed to create a marbled effect.\" — Wikipedia\n\nPrints available upon request: prints@stefancontiero.com\nBest enjoyed on browsers supporting Display-P3 color gamut.\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n@stefan_contiero\n",

            "description": "Toccata is a piece about decay, about the impermanent. The emergence over time or, rather, progression of entropy is a key characteristic of our universe. Everything evolves to nothing. We as mortal beings have sometimes trouble reconciling with this idea. Humans have sought immortality for millennia, be it through ancient potions or modern medicine, be it from leaving a legacy that we feel will stand the test of time. It will, only to decay later than us.\n\nToccata is a piece about change. Change lies at the heart of human cognition and human nature. Our thoughts and our emotions happen over time, and are a function of the change that is both around us and at the very core of our selves. Change comes in nature in cycles. Seasons of growth, seasons of ripe fruits of life, seasons of decay, of death, rebirth.\n\nToccata is music. We find music to convey some of the deepest streams of human condition, connecting it to some other form of being. Music also happens over time, and music happens because of change. Music encodes our feelings better than any other aid we may have. Toccata incorporates this at its very core, as the main sound is Andreas' family piano where he learned to play, sampled this past July.\n\nRead more about the piece, and the collaboration between Marcelo and Andreas on andreasrau.eu/toccata\n\n---\n\nBasic controls:\n- Click on the piece or press spacebar to start it (WebAudio requires user intervention for the music to start). Once the music has started, again click or press spacebar to play/pause.\n- Press “s” to save a still at the current resolution\n- Press “r” to start recording a video at the current resolution, then “r” again to stop.\n\n---\n\nWebM audio-video recording performed using the library RecordRTC by https://muazkhan.com/, MIT licence.",

            "description": "“Sparsely Populated Grid” is the result of an architect’s fascination with Cartographies and a crypto-enthusiast love for Neo Punk aesthetics. The first sketch, drawn by hand with Procreate, was made in October 2021.\n\nThis is an exploration on the field of Generative Cartographies, an abstract diagrammatic representation of a randomly generated area within the virtual IPFS world. Everything starts with an GRID of varying sizes and angles, subsequently POPULATED by a random number of forms. But, how to populate the grid? SPARSELY, of course, with just the right amount of superpositions.\n\nThe algorithm produces varying compositions of fourteen different forms, with seven possible mixes and ten colour palettes. Movement, made possible by its generative digital nature, follows sinusoidal patterns, as if the forms breathed and danced to an unheard music.\n\nBesides, they never forget to celebrate birthdays.\n\n\n// INTERACTIVITY\n\n- CLICK or SPACEBAR to stop movement.\n- UP and DOWN ARROWS to Disable/Enable graphic elements such as texts (wink).\n- LEFT and RIGHT ARROWS (when stopped) to Move frames back and forth.\n- Press 1 for a low-res PNG.\n- Press 2 for a medium-res PNG (3x).\n- Press 3 for a hi-res PNG (6x).\n- Press G for Glitch (low-res).\n- Press P for PixelArt (low-res).\n\nIf you want a different resolution, you can also add ?&res=xxx to the url to get your desired output.

            "description": "\"Balancium\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Art Basel, Basel 2022\n\nIn the fall of 1931, in Alexander Calder's studio, Marcel Duchamp coined the term 'mobile' for his kinetic sculptures. Later, Calder wrote: \"This, in French, means not only 'movable'— but also a 'motive', 'a reason for an act' so I found it a very good word.\"\n \nAround the same year, Bruno Munari started making colorful and whimsical mobiles. He called them \"useless machines\", existing without any purpose and inviting viewers to just look. Elements are connected with nearly invisible threads or wires, allowing the artist to create the illusion of shapes floating in the air.\n\nBalancium is both a virtual mobile and a useless object. Generated by the code, it undergoes a continual transformation. The movement of the air, or invisible fluid, becomes an integral part of the design and amplifies serenity. \n \nThere is a keyboard key that unlocks more variations.",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "'drawz' fxh_t019 is also vanilla javascript template for fxhash\n\n\nfeel free, to use (parts of) it, and learn from the source.\nand use it as a start for your own creative projects and adventures\n\nThis version has some extra routines you can use; \nand a lot of comments in the source\n\n\nA cleaned up - smaller version; just doing the basic tech screen & window-handeling etc. with just drawing dots can be found here.\n(and older and newer updated versions)\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\n\nMostly I start with a clean template; \nthen add: copy-paste routines into it. Things I want to use; sprites, text-font, filters, lines, 3D etc. \nLike kinda lego blocks. Some routines I re-use for 30 years now. \nAlthough often they have changed over time.\n\n\nVanilla javascript - And directly control your rgb buffer\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\ncons:\n- can be overwhelming for starting coders compared to p5js\n- you have to write / use and tinker with new drawing routines by yourself. \n- still can be optimized a lot, and run much faster\n-- (feel free to do that! - release new versions yourself)\n- I just coded it in Notepad++ and tested it in a browser.\n- I have no experience with git-hub, or those other nifty tools\n- I'm more an Artist than a coder, still learning new things as well.\n- I have my own 'old' coding style I picked up ages ago, and still use now and then. Started with basic and Z80a as a teenager.\n- for sure there are still some stupid bugs, spelling errors in it  ^___^\n\npros:\n- fxtemplate - fxpreview when done drawing / splash-screen support on top; while drawing.\n- do like 4000 x 4000 images on safari; on an old Iphone 5\n- just 1 index.html now - small file size: \n- the source of the 'cleaned-up' version is now 34b (not minified, and still comments in the source; can be even smaller)\n- direct control of the RGB buffer; every pixel.\n- I added some basic routines, like drawing points, lines, squares, sprite-brushes, filters, and my pixel-font\n- draw, add-mix or subtract - manipulate every pixel how you wish\n- I work with a big off-screen kind of image; a rgb-buffer; so drawing goes 'mucho' faster and render it to a screen-scaled image.\n- no other libraries used\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nMouse-click switches between:\n- screen scaled image\n- The large image \n\n- The work will refresh and restart after some time\n\nSave image - with s-key \n(includes the fxhash key-seed and num# of the follow-up images)\n--- It can take some seconds before the saving happens; \n--- the browser has to handle (very) large MB .png files first \n--- before it can save them \n\n- splash image support - to hide drawing at start\n- redraw the image after a while; or not.\n- mouse position check for the bigger image\n- fps counter for testing etc.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nwritten in vanilla JavaScript, more info in the source-code\n\n\ndrawz - latest or an updated version can be found at.\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\nIt would be nice; to include more routines into it\nin the future.\n\nAnd instead of 1 big library with everything in it\nI would like to have these templates; \nwhere you can add different little snippets and routines \nthat you want to use into it, and start playing next.\nStill learning new things as well. And getting inspired.\n\nI don't mind people to use the tech-source as a start for their own projects. \n\nBut the palette, and composition & structure build-up; is mine. \nDon't change just 1 or 2 -things then re-release it.\n\nIf you want to release something of your own,\nyour sketch and generative work; really should look total different!\nYou can use the technics to draw new things,\nbut you have to start from scratch again; \nchoosing points, lines etc. to play with and go from there.\nEnjoy! \n\n\n-for the love of Art and jumping in rain puddles-\n\n'like jimi and guitar'  0__.  ^____^\n\n\nxxx  amsterdam  chillout\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n",

            "description": "'drawz' fxh_t019 is also vanilla javascript template for fxhash\n\n\nfeel free, to use (parts of) it, and learn from the source.\nand use it as a start for your own creative projects and adventures\n\nThis version has some extra routines you can use; \nand a lot of comments in the source\n\n\nA cleaned up - smaller version; just doing the basic tech screen & window-handeling etc. with just drawing dots can be found here.\n(and older and newer updated versions)\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\n\nMostly I start with a clean template; \nthen add: copy-paste routines into it. Things I want to use; sprites, text-font, filters, lines, 3D etc. \nLike kinda lego blocks. Some routines I re-use for 30 years now. \nAlthough often they have changed over time.\n\n\nVanilla javascript - And directly control your rgb buffer\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\ncons:\n- can be overwhelming for starting coders compared to p5js\n- you have to write / use and tinker with new drawing routines by yourself. \n- still can be optimized a lot, and run much faster\n-- (feel free to do that! - release new versions yourself)\n- I just coded it in Notepad++ and tested it in a browser.\n- I have no experience with git-hub, or those other nifty tools\n- I'm more an Artist than a coder, still learning new things as well.\n- I have my own 'old' coding style I picked up ages ago, and still use now and then. Started with basic and Z80a as a teenager.\n- for sure there are still some stupid bugs, spelling errors in it  ^___^\n\npros:\n- fxtemplate - fxpreview when done drawing / splash-screen support on top; while drawing.\n- do like 4000 x 4000 images on safari; on an old Iphone 5\n- just 1 index.html now - small file size: \n- the source of the 'cleaned-up' version is now 34b (not minified, and still comments in the source; can be even smaller)\n- direct control of the RGB buffer; every pixel.\n- I added some basic routines, like drawing points, lines, squares, sprite-brushes, filters, and my pixel-font\n- draw, add-mix or subtract - manipulate every pixel how you wish\n- I work with a big off-screen kind of image; a rgb-buffer; so drawing goes 'mucho' faster and render it to a screen-scaled image.\n- no other libraries used\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nMouse-click switches between:\n- screen scaled image\n- The large image \n\n- The work will refresh and restart after some time\n\nSave image - with s-key \n(includes the fxhash key-seed and num# of the follow-up images)\n--- It can take some seconds before the saving happens; \n--- the browser has to handle (very) large MB .png files first \n--- before it can save them \n\n- splash image support - to hide drawing at start\n- redraw the image after a while; or not.\n- mouse position check for the bigger image\n- fps counter for testing etc.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nwritten in vanilla JavaScript, more info in the source-code\n\n\ndrawz - latest or an updated version can be found at.\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\nIt would be nice; to include more routines into it\nin the future.\n\nAnd instead of 1 big library with everything in it\nI would like to have these templates; \nwhere you can add different little snippets and routines \nthat you want to use into it, and start playing next.\nStill learning new things as well. And getting inspired.\n\nI don't mind people to use the tech-source as a start for their own projects. \n\nBut the palette, and composition & structure build-up; is mine. \nDon't change just 1 or 2 -things then re-release it.\n\nIf you want to release something of your own,\nyour sketch and generative work; really should look total different!\nYou can use the technics to draw new things,\nbut you have to start from scratch again; \nchoosing points, lines etc. to play with and go from there.\nEnjoy! \n\n\n-for the love of Art and jumping in rain puddles-\n\n'like jimi and guitar'  0__.  ^____^\n\n\nxxx  amsterdam  chillout\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n",
