            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

Through our art, we aim to pre-empt the future and explore the potential consequences of our current actions. We use symmetry as a visual metaphor for the balance we must strive for in society, particularly in regards to human rights and the treatment of marginalized groups. In the age of technology and AI advancements, it is more important than ever to consider the impact these developments may have on our world and the diverse individuals and communities that inhabit it. Our work serves as a reminder that we must take responsibility for our actions and work towards creating a more just and equitable future for all.\n\nThis token is part of the Floor Exhibit co-curated by the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC and Fort Gallery NFT.",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "My 88-year old mother moved into a nursing home in Sept.  She had reached the point of needing 24-hour care both physically and mentally.  As her eldest child and only daughter, I was left to make the decision and it was a tortuous one.  I felt that I should care for her at home even though I knew that trying to do so would break me quite quickly.\n\nRecently, cleaning out her home in preparation for selling it, I found a cache of old documents - birth certificates, death certificates, marriage licenses, military records, etc.  I had needed to put my struggles into some cathartic exercise, and suddenly it dawned on me what I wanted to do.  I have scanned these old documents and cut glyphs from them to form a family of fonts.  I’ve then used these fonts to create Measure of a Life.\n\nIt seems only yesterday that I ran wild on the farm, my parents and grandparents a forcefield of security, and death something too abstract and distant to have any meaning.  Now I stand at the apex of my family, the bridge between the generations ranging behind me and those before me, my great-granddaughter now the feral child.  How do I feel about this position?  Everything and nothing, a chaos that can only be expressed somewhere beyond words. How does one measure a life - a few documents, a few photos, a plot in the cemetery, a great pang in the heart?\n\nThis work continues a pricing innovation I introduced with my first work of 2023, What If.  For the first week, collectors of my previous projects may collect the token for free.  At the beginning of the 2nd week, the remaining editions will be offered for sale to new collectors. At the beginning of the third week, the remaining editions will be burned. I intend to use this sales approach through June, 2023 while releasing at least one project per month. My goals are to 1)reduce my fretting about the sales and marketing aspects of my art, 2)reward my supporters, and 3)encourage livelier secondary trading of my work. \n\nThis piece uses custom fonts created by the artist as visual and symbolic components.  Being fonts, these are pre-rendered. All other components are algorithmic.\n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in Feb., 2023.\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution file suitable for printing.
