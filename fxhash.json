            "description": "# Los Osos 2422\n\nI was working on the next EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

The first sketch, drawn by hand with Procreate, was made in October 2021.\n\nThis is an exploration on the field of Generative Cartographies, an abstract diagrammatic representation of a randomly generated area within the virtual IPFS world. Everything starts with an GRID of varying sizes and angles, subsequently POPULATED by a random number of forms. But, how to populate the grid? SPARSELY, of course, with just the right amount of superpositions.\n\nThe algorithm produces varying compositions of fourteen different forms, with seven possible mixes and ten colour palettes. Movement, made possible by its generative digital nature, follows sinusoidal patterns, as if the forms breathed and danced to an unheard music.\n\nBesides, they never forget to celebrate birthdays.\n\n\n// INTERACTIVITY\n\n- CLICK or SPACEBAR to stop movement.\n- UP and DOWN ARROWS to Disable/Enable graphic elements such as texts (wink).\n- LEFT and RIGHT ARROWS (when stopped) to Move frames back and forth.\n- Press 1 for a low-res PNG.\n- Press 2 for a medium-res PNG (3x).\n- Press 3 for a hi-res PNG (6x).\n- Press G for Glitch (low-res).\n- Press P for PixelArt (low-res).\n\nIf you want a different resolution, you can also add ?&res=xxx to the url to get your desired output.

            "description": "'Murals' is a collection of 256 abstract compositions born out of an intense period diving deeply into street art, pointillism and the inner workings of neural networks.\n\nThe work explores projection, refraction and abstraction of points as they ripple through multi-dimensional space-time. Points refract through multi-dimensional space to become shapes, which then become coordinate systems for the projections of new points that create a sense of form, texture, lighting, and material properties. \n\nThe work is also a celebration of imperfections and how a combination of many tiny – almost individually imperceptibly small – imperfect details can shape our perceptions of form, materiality, mood. This is explored within this work through subtle uses of sprays, flecks, scuffs, cuts, grain, targets (projections of projections), construction lines, base projections, occasional glitches that cause curvature, bounced light, shadows, and more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n15 colour palettes: \nScream, Night Bus, Double Backflip, Jaws, Sunday, Atom, Space, Tipex, \nGraphite, Leaf, Earth, Bubble Gum, Citrus, Jellyfish, Damp Concrete.\n\n4 times of day (that create subtle changes in light colour):\nDaylight, Winter Morning, Midnight, Sunset\n\n2 Border types: \nNormal, Thin\n\nVarious features that subtly impact appearance surface textures and shard forms:\nMetallic, Engrave, Number of Shards, Scuff Marks, Symmetry. \n\nControls:\n- Press [ S ] to save the work at its current image size as a PNG.\n- Press [ 1 ] to set the image size to 1440 x 1944 pixels (default size)\n- Press [ 2 ] to set the image size to 2880 x 3888 pixels\n- Press [ 3 ] to set the image size to 4320 x 5832 pixels\n\n- Press [ F ] to toggle freeform mode to create custom image sizes and aspect ratios\n- Press [ R ] to reload the image (for use in freeform mode)\n\nThis work has been tested on Chrome and Safari on Mac OS, and also using an Android smartphone.

I have called this element \"fracture\", as it represents a break.\n\nFractals create a visual continuity between the elements, in a loop that recalls itself \"to infinity\" in smaller and smaller underlying elements.\nThe fracture is a symbol of discontinuity as opposed to the fractal itself. \nThis duality is a reference to the balance of Yin and yang.\n\nThis work uses p5.js library.",

            "description": "# Los Osos 2422\n\nI was working on the next EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "This is my little tribute to fx (hash and fam).\n\nDuring an important phone call, I was put on hold. Unconsciously, I began to scribble in my sketchbook. Research shows that scribbling helps focusing, but I dreamed away nonetheless until my pages were filled with scribbles, notes, shopping and a to-do list. \n\nMint a uniquely generated page from my non-existent 100% coded sketchbook (except text typography). \n\nThe page may contain many scribbles and drawings in pen, felt-tip pen, pencil, or less: often references to artists I admire, some in the form of loose scribbles, others in the form of riddles. Those drawings are drawn with code and vary. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to incorporate tributes to all art and every artist I admire. The sketchbook would never finish. Thanks to rudxane I know that it’s ok to publish something unfinished ;-). \n\nOne reference that appears in every token is to Sol Lewitt, an incredible source of inspiration. His artworks consist of instructions. Your sketch book pages contain instructions too. You will find the instructions for the artwork scribbled on your unique page by pressing i.\n\nCurious how the work would look without the ‘distracting’ scribbles and coffee stains? Press ‘a’, ‘w’, or ‘g’. \n\n800 x 800 px\n\nPress ‘s’ to save an image.\n\nMade with p5js and the amazing p5.scribble.js library by Janneck Wullschleger.\n\nFont used: Sacremento-Regular under the SIL Open Font License (OFL).\n\nSee license.md for the licenses of both.\n\nThank you all!",

The first sketch, drawn by hand with Procreate, was made in October 2021.\n\nThis is an exploration on the field of Generative Cartographies, an abstract diagrammatic representation of a randomly generated area within the virtual IPFS world. Everything starts with an GRID of varying sizes and angles, subsequently POPULATED by a random number of forms. But, how to populate the grid? SPARSELY, of course, with just the right amount of superpositions.\n\nThe algorithm produces varying compositions of fourteen different forms, with seven possible mixes and ten colour palettes. Movement, made possible by its generative digital nature, follows sinusoidal patterns, as if the forms breathed and danced to an unheard music.\n\nBesides, they never forget to celebrate birthdays.\n\n\n// INTERACTIVITY\n\n- CLICK or SPACEBAR to stop movement.\n- UP and DOWN ARROWS to Disable/Enable graphic elements such as texts (wink).\n- LEFT and RIGHT ARROWS (when stopped) to Move frames back and forth.\n- Press 1 for a low-res PNG.\n- Press 2 for a medium-res PNG (3x).\n- Press 3 for a hi-res PNG (6x).\n- Press G for Glitch (low-res).\n- Press P for PixelArt (low-res).\n\nIf you want a different resolution, you can also add ?&res=xxx to the url to get your desired output.

            "description": "There’s so much more to our world than what we are able to perceive, let alone understand. Will we ever be able to even fully understand ourselves?\n\n–\n\nElevation is a series of 320 generative elevation drawings of imaginary structures. It is a reminder of the limits of our consciousness, and an ode to the manifold nuances that lie beyond what we can perceive, beyond what we even can imagine.\n\nAs a generative artist, I aim to elevate my own consciousness with the help of the machine. I welcome algorithms and randomness into the creation of my works, taking full control, and intentionally giving it away, always seeking to expand my imagination. For as humans alone, we remain limited to our own edifice of thought, and often fail to free ourselves from the visible, mundane world.\n\nBoth are present in Elevation: the visible and the imaginary, the mundane and the transcendent, the solid and the fragile. Where an architect’s elevation drawing marks the transition from the thought world into the visible world, Elevation remains in-between, depicting both the idea of an imaginary structure, and the structure itself.\n\n–\n\nElevation is intended for print. All holders of an Elevation NFT will be able to order the corresponding signed print in the respective paper format via andreasrau.eu/elevation. Press [s] to save the image as displayed or [p] to generate a print-ready PNG image at 300 dpi. This might take a while, depending on paper format and your hardware.\n\n–\n\nElevation\np5.js, glsl, html, css\nAndreas Rau, 2022",

            "description": "\"Finestre\" means windows or apertures in Italian. This generative art project was inspired by the appreciation of collected memories, windows in time to our past experiences and loved ones. Using basic geometry such as rectangles, squares, circles, ellipses, triangles with random compositions and many possible color palettes, Finestre presents our impression of portals to the Universes of collected memories through abstract still code-based outputs.\n\nFinestre is a collaboration generative art project between generative artists Gonz0x and Schizzo.\n\nFinestre has some fun interactive features which allows collectors to view the work in different configurations. For example, collectors can isolate the deconstructed background layers, isolate the main constructed layer, add Grain and also enter a Free Play mode which allows for the option to draw background and foreground layers, stacking infinitely. You can Save off a render as a .png.\n\nPress \"C\" for Constructed Mode (Isolate Foreground)\nPress \"D\" for Deconstructed Mode (Isolate Background)\nPress \"R\" to reset to Default = C & D\nPress \"G\" to add grain texture with each press\nPress \"S\" saves render\n \nPress \"F\" to toggle Free Play mode\nIn Free Play, Press \"Q\" repeatedly to add Deconstructed layers\nIn Free Play, Press \"W\" repeatedly to add Constructed layers",

            "description": "This is my little tribute to fx (hash and fam).\n\nDuring an important phone call, I was put on hold. Unconsciously, I began to scribble in my sketchbook. Research shows that scribbling helps focusing, but I dreamed away nonetheless until my pages were filled with scribbles, notes, shopping and a to-do list. \n\nMint a uniquely generated page from my non-existent 100% coded sketchbook (except text typography). \n\nThe page may contain many scribbles and drawings in pen, felt-tip pen, pencil, or less: often references to artists I admire, some in the form of loose scribbles, others in the form of riddles. Those drawings are drawn with code and vary. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to incorporate tributes to all art and every artist I admire. The sketchbook would never finish. Thanks to rudxane I know that it’s ok to publish something unfinished ;-). \n\nOne reference that appears in every token is to Sol Lewitt, an incredible source of inspiration. His artworks consist of instructions. Your sketch book pages contain instructions too. You will find the instructions for the artwork scribbled on your unique page by pressing i.\n\nCurious how the work would look without the ‘distracting’ scribbles and coffee stains? Press ‘a’, ‘w’, or ‘g’. \n\n800 x 800 px\n\nPress ‘s’ to save an image.\n\nMade with p5js and the amazing p5.scribble.js library by Janneck Wullschleger.\n\nFont used: Sacremento-Regular under the SIL Open Font License (OFL).\n\nSee license.md for the licenses of both.\n\nThank you all!

And it can be assumed that somewhere in the universe there exist and are successfully used devices for instantaneous energy transfer, let's call them \"EL-monoliths\"\n\nThis work is implemented without the use of 3D graphics. All conclusions are made using software algorithms without third-party libraries\n\n\nPossible variations:\n- Color palliter from light to dramatic dark color\n- Vignetting the image\n- Active/Inactive repeaters\n- Flocks of birds frightened by the noise\n- Voltage transfer satellites\n- Security drones\n- Easter egg\n\nI hope you enjoy the process",
