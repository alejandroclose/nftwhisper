            "description": "A recursive homage to the iconic 10 print pattern.\n\nThis one started as a late night exploration starting from a simple snippet of code, iteratively adding complexity to it until I was able to generate a variety of different patterns.\n\n+ - - - - - +\n\nThis token implements FxParams, and the way I decided to go about it is a bit special. When you mint this token you get what you see - WYSIWYG! - What you see is what you get! - this is done by overriding the hash injected into the code and locking p5's randomness and noise seed manually as parameters.\n\nTherefore, before you start tweaking these values, put the sliders at some random position for the noise and randomness seeds.\n\nTo reiterate:\n\n  - The first two parameters are in place to override the hash that fxhash injects into the code!\n\n  - This is to ensure that the token you ultimately mint is exactly the same as the token you composed for yourself by tweaking the parameters.\n\n  - I recommend setting them to something random at the beginning, and then have fun changing the parameters.\n\n  - Duplicates are technically possible if you set the random and noise seed to the same value as another person. But I don't see a good reason why you would want to do that. If you really want two mints that look exactly the same, that is also possible and I also don't see a reason why you shouldn't be able to do this.\n\n+ - - - - - +\n\nThe Parameters:\n\n  1. Stroke Orientation: there's three different types of stroke orientation, which essentially determine how the lines in the artwork are slanted:\n      - RIGHT: Horizontal and vertical strokes.\n      - ANGLED: slanted forward and backward strokes.\n      - MIXED: A combination of the two previous modes.\n\n  2. Stroke Noise Frequency: the mechanism that decides if a stroke is slanted in a vertical or horizontal (alternatively slanted forward or backward), is based on an underlying perlin noise value. The higher the frequency of this noise, the more turbulently the strokes will alternate direction. Lower values produce smoother structures.\n\n  3. Recursion Noise Frequency: Similarly to the previous parameter, a different noise value determines if the will be a recursive step creating a shorter and denser breakup of the lines. A higher frequency means that these breaks are more turbulent and more frequent and vice versa\n\n 4. Density: Simply a parameter that controls the distance between the lines.\n\n 5. Color Combo: Determines the colors applied to the artwork. There's three different options here.\n\n 5. Invert Colors: A toogle that allows the inversion of the color scheme. Background color becomes stroke color and vice versa.\n\n 6. Stroke Wobble: The higher this value the more swung the resulting lines are.\n\n 7. Scribble Amount: determines the scribbliness of the lines. The higher this parameter is the more scribbly the lines are.\n\n 8. Discontinuity Threshold: Controls the amount of discontinuity in the lines. A higher value means that there will be more gaps between the lines.",

            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

These pigments are arranged in multiple layers, each layer using a different color from one of the carefully curated color palettes. Each palette consists of three to five colors. \n\nAs the pigments are shifted by random noise, new hues and patterns emerge, creating a lovely display of color and movement.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[5] to change the resolution.\n- Press [s] to save a png file at the current resolution.\n\nThis is my first generative art project. Created with p5js.\n\n________\n\nLooks best on high-resolution screens and viewed in live mode. When displayed on a low-resolution screen, an unintended moiré pattern may appear.",
