The robot is like an extension of the artist’s arm, allowing him to create infinite iterations and variations.\n\nThe dots pattern and their density help create the illusion of shadows, gradients and brightness, a technique inherited from the pointillism movement, born in Belgium and France in the late 19th century.\n",

            "description": "Trust is an abstraction of the creative process, finding the line just before form becomes texture. Your experience with the painting requires trust; trust that something will appear from the chaos of the empty space, trust that the composition you imagine halfway through will evolve along with your ideas, and trust that the etchings lend a helping hand to the message of the piece. You may find yourself pulled left and right when decisions are made, and your interpretation at 25%, 50%, and 90% will all differ. This is what makes creating so fulfilling to me, a work of art can change course wildly from start to finish, ever molding itself until it enters the kiln.\n\nPress ‘1’, ‘2’, or  ‘3’ to increase resolution (default is 1, higher than default may not work on certain browsers.

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "FSM is a visual grid-system based on autopoiesis, the principle of self-organization through self-reproduction central to cybernetics. At the heart of FSM is a computational mechanism, a finite-state machine (FSM), which generates sequences of visual outputs by activating particular agents and cycling them through varying sets of configurations.\n\nThe grid-system in FSM is segmented along three axes: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal. This segmentation constitutes the machine’s parametric space.\n\nCertain agents and configurations are programmed to appear exclusively in specific grid segments, illustrating a principle of spatial distribution.\n\nSimilarly, spatial distribution is mirrored by temporal distribution. Specific agents and configurations are set to emerge at predetermined time intervals. This interplay turns FSM in a self-organizing system living on the blockchain.\n\nThe underlying grid of the animation is responsive. Try to change your window size to get different aspect ratios and grid configurations. On the project page you'll find a tool to adjust some parameters via queries components.\nPlease visit: http://fsm.julian-h.de for more information\n\nCONTROLS\n[f] To enter fullscreen mode\n[spacebar] Play or pause the animation\n[s] Export current frame as a PNG\n[g] Capture a small GIF\n[G] Press once to start capturing a GIF and press [G] again to stop the capture process.\n\nCreated using p5.js and GLSL.\n\nJulian Hespenheide, 2023",

The pixels are constantly rearranging, being transferred from offer to taker, liquify, appear and disappear. They are forming endless compositions, sometimes intransparent or with strange spins.\n\nThe level of abstraction has been set to a 2x pixel size and the color palette of the NES with 12 different color modes. 16 pixel patterns serve as the fundamental building blocks and a simplex noise field determines the direction of movement.\n\nclick || space => pause/unpause\n\nView all tr4ns4ctions at https://tr4ns4ctions.com\n\nKim Asendorf, 2022",

In this new piece, I expand on my initial inspirations of the early concrete poetry movement bringing in texts of my own.

Snippets of plausible pistes of reflection as well as lighter more tongue in cheek ideas make up the selection I have curated for the work.

It is recommended that you view the work in 4K or 6K to appreciate the finer details. \n\nThe keyboard buttons: “2”, “4”, and “6” can be pressed to change the resolution to 2K, 4K and 6K resolution accordingly. \n\nTo download an image at its current resolution, press the keyboard button “S”.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtwork created with p5.js\n\n@nbswwit\nSept 2022\n",

There are 17 figures that get combined and mixed over three layers. The figures vary in complexity but are generally created with vertical and horizontal lines only. Figures have at least one seed, some even have a seed per path. A seed is an oscillating pixel that can be compared to a square wave oscillator of audio synthesis and is usually followed by a path or a set of paths. The purpose of the paths is to send the pixels along the lines to make the figures visible through movement and to create a reduction to pure animation.\n\n👽 Kim Asendorf",
