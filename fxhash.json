            "description": "# Los Osos 2422\n\nI was working on the next EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "The concept of organic, obtained from living systems, is said to be an effect that, like a plant and a living being, has grown in a completely dynamic manner in different degrees, and no factor except vital forces has prevented its growth. Organic creation is an example of this type. LÃ©onard de Vinci believed in nature; he wrote, \"Painting is a child of nature\" in his opinion, art should be compatible with nature. His public image of creativity was \"innovation while maintaining fidelity\" to nature. According to Michelangelo, the form the artist gives to the materials is in the artist's mind and the materials themselves. Therefore, the artist is always in a metaphysical struggle with the form and secrets of nature. This is a revelatory process through which the artist discovers the mass of paper already hidden in his mind and the materials. As an architect, I tried to create this work while paying attention to the structuralism of shapes and forms in creation, inspired by the colors in nature and my experience in painting and illustration.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of royalty on each secondary sale.\nEighteen different color palettes and three different borders are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated August 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "The concept of organic, obtained from living systems, is said to be an effect that, like a plant and a living being, has grown in a completely dynamic manner in different degrees, and no factor except vital forces has prevented its growth. Organic creation is an example of this type. LÃ©onard de Vinci believed in nature; he wrote, \"Painting is a child of nature\" in his opinion, art should be compatible with nature. His public image of creativity was \"innovation while maintaining fidelity\" to nature. According to Michelangelo, the form the artist gives to the materials is in the artist's mind and the materials themselves. Therefore, the artist is always in a metaphysical struggle with the form and secrets of nature. This is a revelatory process through which the artist discovers the mass of paper already hidden in his mind and the materials. As an architect, I tried to create this work while paying attention to the structuralism of shapes and forms in creation, inspired by the colors in nature and my experience in painting and illustration.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of royalty on each secondary sale.\nEighteen different color palettes and three different borders are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated August 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "Shattered Obelisks began as a work that is dedicated to my habit of mindlessly drawing on paper when I am stressed, depressed or immersed in difficult thoughts.\n\nLike a patient undergoing psychotherapy and piecing together the causes of unconscious fears and anxieties, I and my artwork have assembled ourselves into something shaped, found order in the chaos and separated it from the external noise.\n\nIt took 3 months of continuous, obsessive work. I have developed a huge library, designed for hand-like drawing. The functionality of this library is four times larger than what is shown in this drop.\n\nI plan to put this library out into the public domain when I deem it complete, and hope that it will help someone express themselves through the creative process as much as it helped for me.\n\nIn case you've encountered a problem with inverted colours, try changing browser or disabling extensions. This problem only occurred once during testing on a massive amount of devices and was resolved by disabling extensions.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES BLOCK:\n\nNOTE 1: This artwork should be viewed at a browser scale of 100%. Reducing the scale will increase the amount of detail, but may unpredictably affect the preservation of the location of secondary objects.\n\nNOTE 2: This work can be printed on a plotter. Click S for saving it in .SVG.\nDetailed instructions and answers to possible questions can be found in the console output of the code.\n\nNOTE 3: This drop is the first one from the series of 3. It will be used as AL ticket in next drops of this series.\n\n@abakshonokoleg\n01.08.2022\nTech: P5.JS\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)",

And while we devise systems for solving unfathomably complex problems, generating algorithmic creativity, and unlocking regenerative biological possibilities, we simultaneously cling to the power and originality of emotional feeling â believing it to be the irreplaceable source of what makes us human.\n\nIf the body is our shell for emotion and soul, can an artificial humanoid be another vessel for these thoughts and feelings â for human essence itself? If our âsoulâ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable? That we may see answers to these questions looks more real every year, and is perhaps a little frightening. \n\nEmotional Shell uses introspective portraits of future selves to question what it means to be human, when the people around us are no longer human.\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 1-3 to select from low, medium, and high quality settings\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2400px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nTENDER x wwatkns\nAugust 2022",

            "description": "The concept of organic, obtained from living systems, is said to be an effect that, like a plant and a living being, has grown in a completely dynamic manner in different degrees, and no factor except vital forces has prevented its growth. Organic creation is an example of this type. LÃ©onard de Vinci believed in nature; he wrote, \"Painting is a child of nature\" in his opinion, art should be compatible with nature. His public image of creativity was \"innovation while maintaining fidelity\" to nature. According to Michelangelo, the form the artist gives to the materials is in the artist's mind and the materials themselves. Therefore, the artist is always in a metaphysical struggle with the form and secrets of nature. This is a revelatory process through which the artist discovers the mass of paper already hidden in his mind and the materials. As an architect, I tried to create this work while paying attention to the structuralism of shapes and forms in creation, inspired by the colors in nature and my experience in painting and illustration.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of royalty on each secondary sale.\nEighteen different color palettes and three different borders are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated August 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "# Los Osos 2422\n\nI was working on the next EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "The concept of organic, obtained from living systems, is said to be an effect that, like a plant and a living being, has grown in a completely dynamic manner in different degrees, and no factor except vital forces has prevented its growth. Organic creation is an example of this type. LÃ©onard de Vinci believed in nature; he wrote, \"Painting is a child of nature\" in his opinion, art should be compatible with nature. His public image of creativity was \"innovation while maintaining fidelity\" to nature. According to Michelangelo, the form the artist gives to the materials is in the artist's mind and the materials themselves. Therefore, the artist is always in a metaphysical struggle with the form and secrets of nature. This is a revelatory process through which the artist discovers the mass of paper already hidden in his mind and the materials. As an architect, I tried to create this work while paying attention to the structuralism of shapes and forms in creation, inspired by the colors in nature and my experience in painting and illustration.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of royalty on each secondary sale.\nEighteen different color palettes and three different borders are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated August 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

And while we devise systems for solving unfathomably complex problems, generating algorithmic creativity, and unlocking regenerative biological possibilities, we simultaneously cling to the power and originality of emotional feeling â believing it to be the irreplaceable source of what makes us human.\n\nIf the body is our shell for emotion and soul, can an artificial humanoid be another vessel for these thoughts and feelings â for human essence itself? If our âsoulâ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable? That we may see answers to these questions looks more real every year, and is perhaps a little frightening. \n\nEmotional Shell uses introspective portraits of future selves to question what it means to be human, when the people around us are no longer human.\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 1-3 to select from low, medium, and high quality settings\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2400px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nTENDER x wwatkns\nAugust 2022",
