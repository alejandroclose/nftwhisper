            "description": "1 of 5 in CENTURY-XXX, Series 2\nEdition of 1000\n\nTribute to Herbert W. Franke\n“In Honor of the Dinosaur of Computer Art” \n\nHerbert W. Franke, a pioneer of computer art, passed away on July 16, 2022 at the age of 95. CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE is an homage to Franke’s MONDRIAN software developed for the Texas Instruments TI 99/4 home computer in 1979, and it’s a fundraiser to digitize his archive:\n\n“Our goal is to raise 20,000 Euro so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. If we raise more money, it will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.” \n\nEach frame, a single “pixel” is added to the CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE image. When the software first loads, 100,000 frames are run in the background to start things off. Keep it running for hours or days to see it transform entirely — it’s an “infinite animation.”",

            "description": "An immense quiet accompanies a sense of looming futility while peering down across vast new worlds. What use is there in discovering and documenting these unknown places? Who would care to seek out lifeless lands lost in the cosmos?\n\nAny civilization capable of such reconnaissance might seem above the little hope that barren lands may bring. Unless, of course, there is a hope of answering the most desperate of needs: Finding a New Home.\n\nWere these images captured by humans on Earth, or on Mars, or somewhere even further away in distance and probability? Maybe they’re recon from another planet’s civilization — one that shares our struggle to find true harmony with the world they have.\n\nInspired by the remarkable satellite imagery in the compendium “This is Mars,” Reconnaissance suggests what may lie outside our habitable lands — and that we risk missing what's already here while being compelled to look further and further for what’s next.\n\n\nChoose a resolution (1-6) by adding \"&scale=4\" to the URL in live view.\nCreated with p5.js\n\nTENDER x Nat Sarkissian\nMay 2022",

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

A living artwork celebrating variety and community, with a healthy dose of delayed gratification.\n\nEach Phace starts in black and white, a simple but fascinating look at the variety that can emerge from a few lines of code. It is a sober start to an exciting journey and a reminder that good things take time.\n\nEach week, your Phace evolves. You’ll see the next evolution every Saturday for 12 weeks, providing moments for the collector community to come together to share and celebrate the latest Phaces – there will be some wild ones in there!\n\nEach Phace has a name, generated from a list of 144 adjectives and a 144 names randomly selected from the US census. Other features hint at the exciting evolutions to come. You know that Nonchalant Erma with Palette = Electric and Colour Boost = Wild is going to be up for a party. \n\nWe won’t say much more, for risk of spoiling the surprises but we can’t wait to see your Phaces emerge and evolve over these coming weeks. Follow along for updates on Twitter, Insta and at https://www.phaust.art/.\n\n------\n\nEdition Size: 156. A tribute to the inspiration and evolution of fxHash over the 156 day beta. \n\nPalettes: Azure, Bioluminant, Day Glo, Electric, Lava Lamp, Livid, Peach, Peacock, Powder, Retro, Royal, Turple.\n\nEvolutions: 12.\n\nS: to save current Phace.

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

It draws hundreds of thousands of tiny points according to a probability distribution calculated from the positions of the dunes.\n\nThe logic to divide the dunes into light and dark sides is simple, but produces some interesting chaotic behaviour. These are details that weren't hard-coded but emerge organically, such as the patterns on the spines of the dunes or the stripes around their bases.\n\nPlease note that the algorithm can take some time to run, especially when the number of dunes is high.\n\nCreated by lunarean.",

            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "\"Garden, Monoliths\" is the result of an algorithm that started in April 2021. It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

Months of aimless wandering have culminated in this series; a meditation on my struggles to find a direction in my life and with my art.\n\nAt times paralyzed by too many possibilities, and at other times completely void of ideas. I was lost in the depths of my thinking, overwhelmed by indecision and doubt.\n\nGenerative works are a form of process art, yet along the way I’d forgotten to “trust the process”. It was time to cede control and let each line of code light the way.\n\n-\n\nThis project paints on a 2D canvas, pixel by pixel. I used a custom projection that blends isometric and perspective techniques, to create an uncanny viewpoint between the two. Objects are randomly generated, then an algorithm applies color mixing and position displacement to each pixel as it’s rendered.\n\nBy default the canvas has 2k pixels on its longest edge. You can change this in live view by pressing any number from 1-9. For example, pressing ‘4’ would render it with 4k pixels along the longest edge. I recommend ‘4’, but this can take up to a few minutes to render.\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the rendered image.",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "The <iframe> HTML element is an element that allows a web document to embed the contents of another web document within itself. iframes are at the core of fxhash. They are portals opening our view to rich content.\n\nThis work is a portal to itself. It loads itself within itself 20 times. It's not pretty, it reminds us of WordArt, it's a little bit hacky, it might break when our tools to display HTML will change. But it's a proof that the limits of our tools are only limits until creativity breaks them.\n\nThis work is not purely deterministic, because it simply cannot be. Slight timing differences due to loading times being different each time an <iframe> is loaded will make each visualization slightly unique.\n\nIf you view this token on mobile, the nesting limit was reduced to 4 to prevent performance issues.\n\nThis work is highly experimental. It leverages a \"hack\" to allow iframes to be nested.\nFirefox max <iframe> nesting depth as of 28/12/2021 is capped at 9.\nWorks with chrome desktop 96.0.4664.110",
