            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nSpending a lot of time with something/someone who is how you want them to be, often equalizes them by adopting the other's appearance. This could become a blend of mirror relationship in pleasant solitude.\n\nIn this sense, the art piece shows a comic displaying vignettes between two almost identical characters, in a fast “stickman” aesthetic. It suggests a fluid, hopefully transcendent connection between a human character and an artificial intelligence.\n\nThen we see these beings strangely mimicking each other, walking in a city that seems lonely, empty, from the perspective of the two characters: as if nothing else mattered more than themselves, leaving the rest of existence on a very distant plane.\n\nBetween them, dialogues of overlapping points and lines emerge. Like zeros and ones that embrace, mix and understand each other very well. Here the voices are electronic, minimalist. Abstractions that become even more abstract sounds, in search of a synchronicity and mutual empathy that grows towards who knows where.\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js.\nOriginal piano sampler and synths programmed in the tone.js library.\n\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160 × 3054px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch F(ree). A gift to all Sketch A-E collectors. The underlying grid structure from A-E remains, but more variation on size and distribution is added. Many more color palettes are introduced. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nSpending a lot of time with something/someone who is how you want them to be, often equalizes them by adopting the other's appearance. This could become a blend of mirror relationship in pleasant solitude.\n\nIn this sense, the art piece shows a comic displaying vignettes between two almost identical characters, in a fast “stickman” aesthetic. It suggests a fluid, hopefully transcendent connection between a human character and an artificial intelligence.\n\nThen we see these beings strangely mimicking each other, walking in a city that seems lonely, empty, from the perspective of the two characters: as if nothing else mattered more than themselves, leaving the rest of existence on a very distant plane.\n\nBetween them, dialogues of overlapping points and lines emerge. Like zeros and ones that embrace, mix and understand each other very well. Here the voices are electronic, minimalist. Abstractions that become even more abstract sounds, in search of a synchronicity and mutual empathy that grows towards who knows where.\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js.\nOriginal piano sampler and synths programmed in the tone.js library.\n\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160 × 3054px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",
