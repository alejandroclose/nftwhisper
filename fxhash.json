            "description": "\"A rare type of bug that supposedly arrived on a cargo ship is destroying crops on planet Uctumi, in the binary system of Extronium. A wide variety of very resistant subspecies has mutated and it is necessary to study and identify all of them to obtain a gen-activated pesticide that will work on all of their variations. The pest department of the Uctumi central government is working hard on it, and they say that these strange critters are probably related to similar species that inhabited the planet Earth of the Solar system a long time ago and have spread over the galaxy.\"\n\nMy second piece using the p5.js raymarcher I wrote. The drawing is made of circles and lines based on the 3D data. I wanted to try something hairy as it's easy to draw lines aligned to the surface normal with this method. I also used a shader for the frame and the glitchy/sketch features.\n\nFeatures \n\nbody color: green-red-purple-yellow-blue-black\nbody tone: dark-light\nspots color: orange-green-blue-yellow-white\nhair tips: yes-no\nhair #1: short-medium-long\nhair #2: short-medium-long\nhead size: small-medium-large\nhead shape: long-spherical-wide\nglitchy mode: 10% chance\nsketch mode: 9% chance \n",

Looking back at the scores of our lives, the notations are never neatly noted, but fully felt.  Rewinding the songs of life are our memories, whether sad, happy, angry, or melancholy. It is not clear whether I am dreaming or awake, but our songs all do end. \n\nIn this final drop (for ?), I have reused the first ever class calligraphy(){} I have written from my genesis drop “Nothing comes from nothing”. As time passes, 10 drops later, across almost to the year, I am grateful for the progress I have made, as an artist, and more importantly as a human. After all, what is behind the code of generative art is a human being. \n\nScores of music, scrolls of calligraphy, calendar or diary, notating life, time passes, and changes are inevitable. Sometimes we sing louder in laughter and joy, sometimes we scribble in uneasiness, sometimes we just get lost in neon lights. Life goes on. You and me, all the same and yet different.  \n\nThere are too many friend artists, friend collectors, fxhash team members, to thank for helping me through this journey. I would like to pay homage to Rudxane in this work, who has taken me under his wings, mentoring and encouraging me in art as well as showing me some degen stuff on the side:-). This homage is not copy-minting, or copying of styles, which I do not have the coding skills to do so even if I wanted to. But it is the influence of taste in many works of Rudxane. In a vague but agreeable taste, I present to you Life has no scores. \n\nWhat I was taught was disrupted, and grid studies left unfinished, and oh do we have a BINGO?\n\nTested on Chrome.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "\"◉◉◉\" presents a collection of pointillistic drawings generated by p5js. However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.\n\"◉◉◉\" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.\n\nThe technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

            "description": "What would you do if you found a lost wallet; return it to it's owner or keep it? \n\nAs an experiment, i'll send a NFT (another visual pattern created by same algorithm as 1/1) at random times to each of the created wallet addresses to see what happens:\n\nHow many of them are going to be transferred to the owner of the wallet, how many will be stolen? How many of them will be transferred again when the piece is resold? \n\n\"Lost Wallets' is a visual wallet generator which uses a cellulator automata algorithm to encrypt and visualize mnemonics words choosen from the bip39 dictionary. The circular pattern is an encrypted visual representation of seed phrases that create a unique crypto wallet. Each of these patterns can be reversed back to the seed phrases by reversing the rules used in encryption.  \n\nWhen i was as a kid, it was fascinating to code to send encrypted messages between friends even though algorithm was very simple. Encryption was something which always fascinated me. It inspired me to create something which uses cryptography to create visual outputs in order to create true 'crypto-art. Rather than purely relying on text and numbers I wanted to paint those 1s and 0s with color and shapes. \n\nAs \"crypto-art' became the definition of digital art signed by the blockchain, I think crypto-art is an artform which is created by cryptography algorithms, which paved the way to the creation of this piece. \n\nUnder the Hood:\n \nThe algorithm picks 8 to 15 non repeating words from bip39 dictionary (a special dictionary for wallet generation). Then it converts each word into binary array (Ones and zeros) to feed the initial sequence of celluar automata algorithm. In this piece, i have used radial placement to display the bits created by the cellular automata algorithm; which i think creates some interesting visuals combined with perlin noise distortion, resembling cellular forms seen under microscope. \n\nAs the words are chosen from bip39 dictionary, each image represents a tezos wallet which has a wallet address and can be imported to 'Temple Wallet' using the private key, which i think of airdropping some random nfts in the future to those wallets just for experimentation.\n\nExport Options:\n\n*Chrome is recommended for exports(Faster and higher resolution)\n\nPress 1 to 8 to export PNG multiples of 1920px\n\nPress 'k' to download information of created wallet. Highly recommend importing secret keys to Temple Wallet, so you can re-transfer when you recieve the airdrop to the created wallet before anyone else.\n\n***The wallets generated through this code is not intended for real life use. Secret key can be accessed by everyone. It's created for art purposes***\n\nCreated with p5.js & TezTech\nMurat Atimtay 2022 ",

The resemblance to ferrofluids and organic \"cells\" leads to interesting and almost hypnotic visual effects that evolve indefinitely.\n\nBlack and white is the most common feature but there are 5 more colour palettes possible. The parameters are hand picked and selected randomly from a pool, every drop is unique.\n\nPress,\n\"s\" to save a screenshot in 4k\n\"p\" to switch to black and white\n\"space\" to pause\n\"left arrow\" to step back\n\"right arrow\" to step forward\n\nOriginal artwork by William Watkins · Lyon, 2022",
