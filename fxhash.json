            "description": "Toccata is a piece about decay, about the impermanent. The emergence over time or, rather, progression of entropy is a key characteristic of our universe. Everything evolves to nothing. We as mortal beings have sometimes trouble reconciling with this idea. Humans have sought immortality for millennia, be it through ancient potions or modern medicine, be it from leaving a legacy that we feel will stand the test of time. It will, only to decay later than us.\n\nToccata is a piece about change. Change lies at the heart of human cognition and human nature. Our thoughts and our emotions happen over time, and are a function of the change that is both around us and at the very core of our selves. Change comes in nature in cycles. Seasons of growth, seasons of ripe fruits of life, seasons of decay, of death, rebirth.\n\nToccata is music. We find music to convey some of the deepest streams of human condition, connecting it to some other form of being. Music also happens over time, and music happens because of change. Music encodes our feelings better than any other aid we may have. Toccata incorporates this at its very core, as the main sound is Andreas' family piano where he learned to play, sampled this past July.\n\nRead more about the piece, and the collaboration between Marcelo and Andreas on andreasrau.eu/toccata\n\n---\n\nBasic controls:\n- Click on the piece or press spacebar to start it (WebAudio requires user intervention for the music to start). Once the music has started, again click or press spacebar to play/pause.\n- Press “s” to save a still at the current resolution\n- Press “r” to start recording a video at the current resolution, then “r” again to stop.\n\n---\n\nWebM audio-video recording performed using the library RecordRTC by https://muazkhan.com/, MIT licence.",

            "description": "\"In the boundless loneliness of space, strangeness abounds.\"\nT E C T O N I C A logs\n\nStanding here are the digital engrams of a spacefaring civilization, the final remnants of the Universe's vast computer, a layered stratum of glitched, galaxy-sized digital memory banks. These calcified data deposits have accumulated over eons, forming physical tectons that span light-years of space. They offer a glimpse into the fundamental building blocks employed by a forgotten alien civilization which encoded its entire culture as digital data in physical form. While the specifications for this stellar machine have been lost to time, its fractured components continue to perform computations, seemingly trapped in an eternal loop. We can observe the inner workings of this enigmatic structure, but its true meaning remains forever silent, its message encrypted.\n\nT E C T O N I C A serves as an artistic exploration of this fictional world and its algorithm-driven deep-space geology. Collectors can reserve their iteration by minting a ticket and use the params interface to choose their seed number and triptych part. Generator uses a WYSIWYG principle to derive a PRNG seed from the wallet address and the chosen seed number. There are 1000 seeds available for each wallet. You can explore seeds using a separate seed explorer here:\n\nhttps://protocell-labs.github.io/tectonica-seed-explorer/\n\n__________\n\nT E C T O N I C A is written in JavaScript using Three.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry and in-browser rendering (see LICENSE file for the list of all dependencies). We recommend using Chromium browser on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration to get the full functionality (like key controls). Please ensure that the token functions correctly on your device before minting.\n\nUse click (touch) to explode / unexplode the structure, click hold (touch hold) to set new explosion center (also E + click), P for pause / unpause palette cycle, B to change background color, S to download loader animation, G for gif capture, and numbers 1-5 to export progressively higher resolution of the artwork as a png image. Available URL parameters are listed in the browser console.\n\nWe paid tribute to artists and personalities who inspire our work by naming color palettes after them. To support other fellow artists on their creative journeys, we have left T E C T O N I C A code open (unminified and unobfuscated) and available in a public repository on GitHub. We believe that supporting open tools is a mission every generative artist should partake in.\n\nCreated in 2024 by {protocell:labs}",

            "description": "\"In the boundless loneliness of space, strangeness abounds.\"\nT E C T O N I C A logs\n\nStanding here are the digital engrams of a spacefaring civilization, the final remnants of the Universe's vast computer, a layered stratum of glitched, galaxy-sized digital memory banks. These calcified data deposits have accumulated over eons, forming physical tectons that span light-years of space. They offer a glimpse into the fundamental building blocks employed by a forgotten alien civilization which encoded its entire culture as digital data in physical form. While the specifications for this stellar machine have been lost to time, its fractured components continue to perform computations, seemingly trapped in an eternal loop. We can observe the inner workings of this enigmatic structure, but its true meaning remains forever silent, its message encrypted.\n\nT E C T O N I C A serves as an artistic exploration of this fictional world and its algorithm-driven deep-space geology. Collectors can reserve their iteration by minting a ticket and use the params interface to choose their seed number and triptych part. Generator uses a WYSIWYG principle to derive a PRNG seed from the wallet address and the chosen seed number. There are 1000 seeds available for each wallet. You can explore seeds using a separate seed explorer here:\n\nhttps://protocell-labs.github.io/tectonica-seed-explorer/\n\n__________\n\nT E C T O N I C A is written in JavaScript using Three.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry and in-browser rendering (see LICENSE file for the list of all dependencies). We recommend using Chromium browser on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration to get the full functionality (like key controls). Please ensure that the token functions correctly on your device before minting.\n\nUse click (touch) to explode / unexplode the structure, click hold (touch hold) to set new explosion center (also E + click), P for pause / unpause palette cycle, B to change background color, S to download loader animation, G for gif capture, and numbers 1-5 to export progressively higher resolution of the artwork as a png image.

            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

            "description": "This series unearths the unique and energetic rhythms found within simple repetitions. Using distinct minimalist components, the algorithm patterns, contorts, and intertwines geometries to reveal rich and vital maximalist compositions. The explorations of Risonanza revels in the quirks that emerge through this process, seemingly with spontaneity. They invite us to identify and savor the underlying simplicity of a common language that resides amidst all manners of imperfections, randomness, and intricate complexities we perceive around us.\n\nEmbodying the equilibrium between simplicity and intricacy, these works represent the dance between the innate harmony of existence and life's unknown paths. This balance of forces provides a simple and joyful invitation to attune to the energetic, complex, and singular harmonious essence of each work of art – an embodiment of the eternal resonance that courses through the universe.\n\n\n—————\n\nTENDER x whitekross\nSeptember 2023\n\nRisonanza is Italian for Resonance, and is a generative art series created by Alessandro Fiore (AKA whitekross) in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n—————\n\n\nKey commands:\n\n1 = 2000x3000\n2 = 4000x6000\n3 = 6000x9000 (Dependent on your browser limitations, tested on Safari (Mac))\ns = Save at current resolution\n\n\nLicense:\n\nSee LICENSE.md in live view for details.",
