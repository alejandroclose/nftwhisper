            "description": "üî• BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY \"open edition\" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",

            "description": "BluePrints is an experimentation with fx(params).\n\nIt consists of various structural and environmental components that you can modify and co-create by adjusting parameters. Keep in mind that the final outcome will differ due to the use of a new hash for your mint.\n\n\nInstructions and tips;\n\n- You can easily discover different types of structures by utilizing the 'Architecture' and 'Style' parameters. Then, use the sliders below to refine the specifics.\n\n- Inside the 'GiveMeColors' button, there are three distinct color palettes that are randomized and will change based on the hash.\n\n- Similarly, the 'SurpriseMe' button features four different shader effects that are randomized and will change based on the hash.\n\n- Once you decide the parameters, hit the ‚Äònew hash‚Äô button at least a few times to explore your possible mint outputs.\n\n\nAny remaining mints will be burned in three days.\n\nMade with p5js.\n@distcollective, March 2023\n",

This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press ‚Äúe‚Äù to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press ‚Äúr‚Äù. Which one is the ‚Äúfinished‚Äù artwork? All of them. What is ‚Äúthe‚Äù artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: ‚Äúe‚Äù. To restore: ‚Äúr‚Äù\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing ‚Äúp‚Äù\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing ‚Äús‚Äù (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing ‚Äúd‚Äù followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press ‚Äúd 0‚Äù (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don‚Äôt know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press ‚Äúq‚Äù\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press ‚Äúv‚Äù followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press ‚Äúv‚Äù followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing ‚Äúo‚Äù. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr√≠guez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

So, I named the algorithm 'Kralen', which means 'beads' in Dutch.\n\nThe algorithm 'Kralen' creates random bezier curves using the edges of a rectangular boundary, and places beads atop these curves to create a 'bead maze' effect. The algorithm offers different curve creation modes, with the most common mode being 'Mix'. In this mode, two random edges of the boundary are chosen to form bezier curves. Other modes create curves that are horizontally or vertically oriented, or formed using only the corners of the boundary\n\n---\n\nThe work is created with p5.js with the help of bezier.js for working with bezier curves.",

            "description": "\"Rangxel\" is part of the live outdoor art installation - 'Computational Convergence' at India Art Fair, held from 9-12 February 2023 in New Delhi. \n\nRangxel is an interpretation of traditional Rangoli formations as tesseracts, combined to form monolithic structures. \n\nRangoli is a traditional artform that originated in India and is typically created during rituals and festivals like Diwali. It involves drawing intricate designs, typically on the floor, using materials such as colored powders, flowers, and grains. \n\nRangoli is meant to bring prosperity and happiness to a home and can range from simple geometric patterns to more complex depictions of nature.\n\nThe Rangxel tesseracts are created through rule-based instructions, following traditional Rangoli formation principles like symmetry, repeating patterns, and themes, resulting in interconnected, multi-dimensional forms of fragments.\n\nThese monolithic structures also reflect natural 3D grids found in nature such as crystals and honeycombs,presenting a deconstructed, pixelated matrix of our universe. \n\nUltimately, the reality we live in is an abstraction of the algorithm narrated by the creator.\n\n#StayPixelated\n\nControls (){\nDouble click Once to Enable Rotate around Tesseract;\nDouble click Twice to Disable  Rotate;\nDouble click Thrice to Go back original Composition;\nRotate , Zoom , Pan with Touch/Mouse;\n}\n",

            "description": "Bardez is the Armenian word for garden. It is etymologically tied to an ancient word for paradise, but that link goes deeper than etymology. Gardens have always been small pieces of paradise for me, and hearing the word in Armenian triggers a flood of warm memories.\n\nMemories of wandering around my grandfather‚Äôs garden, plucking ripe plums and figs from their branches.\nMemories of playing in my parents yard, the scent of jasmine in the summer heat.\nOf sun warmed tomatoes in my mom‚Äôs vegetable patch.\nThe smell of dirt and grass.\nMud on my hands.\nSun on my skin.\nMemories of paradise.\n\nI hope you enjoy these gardens I‚Äôve planted, and I hope they remind you of some warm and wonderful memories.\n \nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n - This piece uses a shader to compute the lighting of the terrain in the first frame. If you don‚Äôt have a graphics card, you may have difficulty running this.\n\n - Append ‚Äú&mag=N‚Äù to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you the progress of the render, and also show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.\n\n - Finally, collectors at the highest tier will be entitled to a signed print of their edition. For further details and updates, keep an eye on my Twitter (@_NatSarkissian).\n",

It is a comtemplation of the passing of time, the inevitability of change, and the beauty that can be found in impermanence. It is an invitation to reflect on the fluidity of life and our own place within the grander scheme of things. A testament to the resilience and grit required to survive in a constantly changing world. Despite the harsh conditions and ever-present threat of change, the desert sands endure, shifting but not breaking; their beauty and strength undiminished.\n\nMade of several overlapping curved lines, each piece is a depiction of movement and fluidity, symbolizing sands in a constant state of motion. The curves blend and mix, creating new patterns and hues where they overlap, much like the way that life experiences blend and mix to create new and unique outcomes. The uneven distribution of grains across each piece represents timelessness. Areas of low accumulation of grains are a reminder of the years of constant erosion. The sands of time have existed and will exist in a state of constant motion and change for eons, for the lifetime. This way, each piece also evokes nostalgia, as we ponder on our past lives.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your life‚Äôs story will develop.‚Äù ‚Äï Dieter F. Uchtdorf",
