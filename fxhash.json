            "description": "I side with the idea that we made this reality so weird merely to satisfy our -psychotic- need to overcomplicate things. Not you, of course.\n\nThat's why I believe that our choices don't \"create our own path\" but a maze for others to (try to) solve.\nThis God or that One or none, the old songs or the new ones, rooting for or against…\nThe deepest we meet into each other's maze, the more choices we share. Reciprocally, when we lack the interest to explore even a couple of turns, we're but a first impression to each other.\n\nThis work examines those ideas by continually presenting options to N individuals and then tracking their choices, which in turn generates different outputs at different depths.\n\nTo access them:\n- press \"S\" for story mode, the sequence of choices\n  - then, press \"1\" through \"5\" to change the speed\n- press \"L\" for landscape, the first impression\n- press \"D\" to see the details and view the mazes (may take a while)",

            "description": "aRo \"a Representation of\"\n\nLike a ladder or a hammer, art is often a tool. The less practical and most bizarre, basically the most overcomplicated self-made tool anyone could ever imagine. But it's THE tool to explore ideas.\nI created this one to investigate, to poke and nudge at a few concepts that seem to go hand-in-hand.\nFirstly, Representation, as in changing something to better explain it. Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.\n\nWhile many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.\n\nBut there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.\n\nI can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.\n\nWhat happens when a flower has more petals than pixels? Why do we know there's more layers to that thumbnail?\nMy best answer is:\n\n--Press \"s\" key to save a bigger image (2400x3200 px)\n",
