            "description": "The preparations for the first mission began in 2142. It had become clear that mining petroleum on Earth would soon become financially unfeasible, so looking to other planets was the only logical choice. It took seventeen more years to perfect the technology so that the first colonists could reach Proxima b within the lifetime of one generation.\n\nAfter 45 years of travelling at almost one-tenth of the speed of light, they reached their new home. It was rich in petrochemicals but scarce in the nutrients necessary for long term human survival. After merely six generations, humanity was forced to travel once again in search of a new world. The four missions that parted from the Proxima system to colonise other possibly habitable planets in the galaxy sparked a new age of human civilisation that would never see itself united and thriving again.\n\nEventually, all the colonies became independent societies as their differing interests drove them apart. Each small civilisation chose its path, wandering the void of space alone. Over time, millions of kilometres apart, each colony developed its own culture and traditions. While their habits and customs changed, some things remained the same across all the societies, like how it became a certain tradition to convert the outer world years and days to Earth time and celebrate holidays according to the calendar of the old world.\n\nThe new nomads learned from the first pilgrims. They used the technology once optimised for oil extraction to traverse other worlds, searching for sustenance. Peculiar wandering nonspaces emerged from the involuntary degrowth of human civilisation.\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "This generative art token was created as a collaboration between generative artist frederative and the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC. It began as a discussion about storytelling on the blockchain. What does it mean to be living through a pandemic while simultaneously experimenting with nascent technologies, both of which are radically disrupting our lives? The answer is [i.wonder] by frederative x NFTMuseumSC. \n\nWe share 33% of future royalties with the original minters in an effort to encourage the promotion of fxhash artists and raise awareness of generative art on the blockchain. We want this art to spread far and wide. Thank you for your support in helping us accomplish this goal.\n\nToken Details:\n\n[i.wonder]\nCollab by frederative x NFTMuseumSC\nMay 2022\nfxhash Compliant NFT\n\n\nArtist Bio:\n\nfrederative (real name redacted) is a generative artist from the snowy depths of the midwest (US).  He has been coding for many years but only recently discovered the joy of generative art.  Like many others, he was drawn into the field from watching TheCodingTrain and quickly fell off the deep end with artistic coding.  Bouncing between the worlds of procedural generation, glitch art, and particle motion, frederative’s work can best be described as “ok” and also “somewhat decent.”  At home, his spouse can constantly be seen shaking her head and saying “I can’t believe people pay money for this.”  His playful nature and sense of humor often leak into his art and biographical musings.\n\n\nArtist Statement\n\n[i.wonder] is an exploration of parenting and how historical events can impact parents and their children.  Our grandparents grew up during the Great Depression and lived through eras of war.  At times, commodities were scarce or unattainable and one had to ‘make do.’  Nothing could ever go to waste - everything had to be washed, reused, fixed, stitched up.  Their eccentricities now reflect those times, leaving their children to shake their heads at their extreme frugalness.  Consumer culture has eviscerated this ideal in current generations, yet they still continue on.\n\nAs a parent I wonder if the impacts of the Covid pandemic have imparted similar behaviors on myself.  Crowds cause me to hyperventilate and search for empty space.  My personal bubble has extended by several feet - any incursions and I become uncomfortable.  Bringing my kids out in public is a waking nightmare at times - any cough or fever now comes with the concern that it might not just be another kid cold.  \n\nOur lives have been changed and I really, really wonder if that’s something that has surreptitiously changed our parenting style.  When they’re grown up, will they think that our eccentricities stemming from Covid are annoying?  Cute - a relic of a bygone era?  Or just \n\nEmbedded text:\n\nI remember my grandparents being frugal.\nThey would use every part of an animal.\nThey would wash plastic bags to reuse.\nThey would never spend money frivolously.\nNothing would go to waste.\nI wonder what stories we'll tell our grandchildren.\nI wonder if they'll think we're crazy for avoiding crowds.\nI wonder if they'll understand the horror of other people.\nI wonder if they'll understand why we hold them tight.\nI wonder if an errant cough will make them panic.\nI wonder.\n\nInteractions:\n- Press 's' save hi-res\n\nAdditional Credits and Attributions:\n\nhttps://p5js.org/\nColor palettes derived from Chromotome: https://kgolid.github.io/chromotome-site/\nShadows: https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/drawingContext\nLinear gradient: https://p5js.org/examples/color-linear-gradient.html \nFloyd-Steinberg dithering (implementation based on: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1192123)\nm5x7 font by Daniel Linssen: https://managore.itch.io/m5x7 \nPersonal use license only\n\n\nAbout the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC:\n\nEstablished in October of 2021, the mission of the Non-Fungible Token Museum is to provide a physical and virtual space for NFT art education, collaboration and exhibition in an effort to help our communities benefit from emerging blockchain technologies.

            "description": "The preparations for the first mission began in 2142. It had become clear that mining petroleum on Earth would soon become financially unfeasible, so looking to other planets was the only logical choice. It took seventeen more years to perfect the technology so that the first colonists could reach Proxima b within the lifetime of one generation.\n\nAfter 45 years of travelling at almost one-tenth of the speed of light, they reached their new home. It was rich in petrochemicals but scarce in the nutrients necessary for long term human survival. After merely six generations, humanity was forced to travel once again in search of a new world. The four missions that parted from the Proxima system to colonise other possibly habitable planets in the galaxy sparked a new age of human civilisation that would never see itself united and thriving again.\n\nEventually, all the colonies became independent societies as their differing interests drove them apart.

            "description": "For my first drop on the new fxhash v1.0 I wanted to make something different. So I challenged myself to write a raymarcher like the ones I use in my shaders but in p5.js and make a fully procedural scene with it. It's a bit tricky to work with vectors once you are used to GLSL, but I managed to write a decent algorithm that scans a grid and slowly draws the image. It draws it with circles and triangles for the grass. The first thing I used for testing was a SDF of a plane with some tall bars on it. Then I was trying different distortions on the shapes and in one moment the results gave me the idea of a scene with mushrooms and grass on an undulated terrain. Later I added a small river and a cloudy sky. I think I was inadvertently inspired by some children's books I had when I was a kid. \n\nBest viewed full screen.\n\nFeatures:\n\nMood: happy - normal - melancholic - strange - sleepy\nMushrooms: 2 - 4 (sometimes one of the mushrooms can only be seen on full screen)\nMushroom height: short - medium - tall\nMushroom fatness: S - M - L - XL\nMushroom shape: 1 - 2 - 3- 4 - 5\nMushroom tilt\nFlowers color: white - yellow - pink - cyan - multicolor\nRiver: yes - no\nCamera orientation: north - south",
