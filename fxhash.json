            "description": "‚ÄúKlyft‚Äù is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at PARIS+ par Art Basel.\n\nKlyft is a juxtaposition of two different projections for the future. One, made by the World Economic Forum, suggests that the global gender gap will have closed by the year 2154. The other, by the UN IPCC, estimates that global warming will reach 3.2 degrees celcius by the year 2100.\n\nKlyft makes use of the unique temporal aspect of computational art by developing its expression gradually over the next 132 years. As we come closer to 2154, the space between the two shapes in Klyft will grow smaller to symbolize the closing of the gender gap. As time goes on, however, Klyft also becomes more and more glitched out to represent the projected increases in greenhouse gases and climate catastrophes.\n\nIn the end, Klyft‚Äôs expression will be heavily corrupted, and the two shapes will have reached each other.\n\n¬∑ URL parameters ¬∑\n\nYou can add the following parameters to the URL to change the behavior of the piece.\n\ndate=<YYYY-MM-DD> ‚Äî See how Klyft looks on another day. Use the format YYYY-MM-DD. \n\ncolor=<number> ‚Äî See the piece in another color scheme. The numbers loop around, so 17 equals 0, 18 equals 1, etc. \n\nresolution=<number> ‚Äî View the piece in a higher resolution. 1 is normal resolution, 2 is double, etc. No decimals allowed.\n\nimage=true ‚Äî Save the piece as an image. \n\nrecord=true ‚Äî Save the piece as a video in WEBM format.\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will show Klyft in double resolution on the day gender equality is achieved according to the WEF:\n\ndate=2154-01-01&resolution=2\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will save a video of Klyft in the ‚ÄòStokkendahl Dalgas‚Äô color scheme:\n\ncolor=14&record=true\n\n¬∑ Interactions ¬∑\n\nPressing the following keys will trigger functionality as well as add related URL parameters automatically. \n\nPressing D will increment the date by 1 year.\n\nPressing C will increment the color index by 1.\n\nPressing R will toggle between normal and double resolution.\n\nPressing I will toggle the image URL parameter, which saves the piece as an image. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nPressing V will toggle the video URL parameter, which saves the piece as a video. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nThere are secret key presses as well. Some of them only work outside of iframe. \n\n¬∑ Accessibility ¬∑\n\nKlyft is built to support screen readers. It has been tested using MacOS‚Äô VoiceOver, and uses p5.js‚Äô describeElement() to provide screen reader functionality.\n\nIf you have any comments (good or bad) on the screen reader integration, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out on my Twitter: @ada_ada_ada_art. \n\n¬∑ Credits and license ¬∑\n\nKlyft is made with p5.js.\n\nKlyft is licensed under a modified version of the Climate Strike License (CSL).",

Perspective and perception can be so different.\n\nBased on some of my photos from the last 365 days that trigger emotional memories, even if they are not directly connected. By the way, Fischbach is the name of the small village where I grew up. It was a great time!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach piece uses pairs of photos and colors (top/bottom).\n\nThe animated collage itself is based on two layers. The first layer uses a double buffer to cut, colorize and animate the photos. The second layer is mainly just for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nCutting and pasting photos is based on a variable moving color grid, the fixed horizon, the variable position of the photos top/bottom, the previous buffer and some magic distance calculations between them.\n\nThe grid itself is a combination of vertical color stripes with variable position and distance factors that determine the color gradient between the two colors, and folds that alternate between the two colors depending on the horizontal and vertical values.\n\nEspecially the entropy of the photos and the colored grid influence the pixel movement.\n\nAnimation changes are triggered after a random number of frames and effect folds, stripes and photo position. These replace parts of the current collage (fade to black) or add some (discard fragment updates).\n\nFeatures:\n\n- top color [12] - hue, colorful & bright\n- bottom color [6] - hue, less colorful & bright\n- top photo [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ‚ô†4, driften, brand-pyramide, z√§pfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- bottom photo: [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ‚ô†4, driften, brand-pyramide, z√§pfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- horizon [0.618, 0.5, 0.382] (down, center, up)\n- hectic [3, 5, 11] (calm, slightly, very)\n- horizontal folds [113, 365, 997, 2153, 3987] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- vertical folds [7, 37, 127, 571, 1501, 3147] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- min stripes [1, 3, 5] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 300 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar, mouse click or tap touch to trigger animation changes\n- `c` to take a picture\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `p` to pause\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- autopause - enable automatic pausing\n- pixelratio=2 - sets the pixel ratio (default: device)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=10 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

One, made by the World Economic Forum, suggests that the global gender gap will have closed by the year 2154. The other, by the UN IPCC, estimates that global warming will reach 3.2 degrees celcius by the year 2100.\n\nKlyft makes use of the unique temporal aspect of computational art by developing its expression gradually over the next 132 years. As we come closer to 2154, the space between the two shapes in Klyft will grow smaller to symbolize the closing of the gender gap. As time goes on, however, Klyft also becomes more and more glitched out to represent the projected increases in greenhouse gases and climate catastrophes.\n\nIn the end, Klyft‚Äôs expression will be heavily corrupted, and the two shapes will have reached each other.\n\n¬∑ URL parameters ¬∑\n\nYou can add the following parameters to the URL to change the behavior of the piece.\n\ndate=<YYYY-MM-DD> ‚Äî See how Klyft looks on another day. Use the format YYYY-MM-DD. \n\ncolor=<number> ‚Äî See the piece in another color scheme. The numbers loop around, so 17 equals 0, 18 equals 1, etc. \n\nresolution=<number> ‚Äî View the piece in a higher resolution. 1 is normal resolution, 2 is double, etc. No decimals allowed.\n\nimage=true ‚Äî Save the piece as an image. \n\nrecord=true ‚Äî Save the piece as a video in WEBM format.\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will show Klyft in double resolution on the day gender equality is achieved according to the WEF:\n\ndate=2154-01-01&resolution=2\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will save a video of Klyft in the ‚ÄòStokkendahl Dalgas‚Äô color scheme:\n\ncolor=14&record=true\n\n¬∑ Interactions ¬∑\n\nPressing the following keys will trigger functionality as well as add related URL parameters automatically. \n\nPressing D will increment the date by 1 year.\n\nPressing C will increment the color index by 1.\n\nPressing R will toggle between normal and double resolution.\n\nPressing I will toggle the image URL parameter, which saves the piece as an image. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nPressing V will toggle the video URL parameter, which saves the piece as a video. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nThere are secret key presses as well. Some of them only work outside of iframe. \n\n¬∑ Accessibility ¬∑\n\nKlyft is built to support screen readers. It has been tested using MacOS‚Äô VoiceOver, and uses p5.js‚Äô describeElement() to provide screen reader functionality.\n\nIf you have any comments (good or bad) on the screen reader integration, don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out on my Twitter: @ada_ada_ada_art. \n\n¬∑ Credits and license ¬∑\n\nKlyft is made with p5.js.\n\nKlyft is licensed under a modified version of the Climate Strike License (CSL).",

Perspective and perception can be so different.\n\nBased on some of my photos from the last 365 days that trigger emotional memories, even if they are not directly connected. By the way, Fischbach is the name of the small village where I grew up. It was a great time!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach piece uses pairs of photos and colors (top/bottom).\n\nThe animated collage itself is based on two layers. The first layer uses a double buffer to cut, colorize and animate the photos. The second layer is mainly just for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nCutting and pasting photos is based on a variable moving color grid, the fixed horizon, the variable position of the photos top/bottom, the previous buffer and some magic distance calculations between them.\n\nThe grid itself is a combination of vertical color stripes with variable position and distance factors that determine the color gradient between the two colors, and folds that alternate between the two colors depending on the horizontal and vertical values.\n\nEspecially the entropy of the photos and the colored grid influence the pixel movement.\n\nAnimation changes are triggered after a random number of frames and effect folds, stripes and photo position. These replace parts of the current collage (fade to black) or add some (discard fragment updates).\n\nFeatures:\n\n- top color [12] - hue, colorful & bright\n- bottom color [6] - hue, less colorful & bright\n- top photo [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ‚ô†4, driften, brand-pyramide, z√§pfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- bottom photo: [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ‚ô†4, driften, brand-pyramide, z√§pfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- horizon [0.618, 0.5, 0.382] (down, center, up)\n- hectic [3, 5, 11] (calm, slightly, very)\n- horizontal folds [113, 365, 997, 2153, 3987] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- vertical folds [7, 37, 127, 571, 1501, 3147] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- min stripes [1, 3, 5] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 300 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar, mouse click or tap touch to trigger animation changes\n- `c` to take a picture\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `p` to pause\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- autopause - enable automatic pausing\n- pixelratio=2 - sets the pixel ratio (default: device)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=10 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch F(ree). A gift to all Sketch A-E collectors. The underlying grid structure from A-E remains, but more variation on size and distribution is added. Many more color palettes are introduced. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.",

            "description": "‚ÄúWe are segmented from all around and in every direction. The human being is a segmentary animal. Segmentarity is inherent to all the strata composing us. Dwelling, getting around, working, playing: life is spatially and socially segmented. The house is segmented according to its rooms‚Äô assigned purposes; streets, according to the order of the city; the factory, according to the nature of the work and operations performed in it. We are segmented in a binary fashion, following the great major dualist oppositions: social classes, but also men-women, adult-children, and so on.‚Äù \n\n-a thousand plateaus: capitalism and schizophrenia, Deleuze and Guattari\n\nLinear Segmentarity explores the concept of a segmented existence, which refers to how our lives are broken up into discreet parts or segments.\n\nI was inspired by the philosophers Deleuze and Guattari. These thinkers studied the ways we are segmented into work and play, family and friends, and past and present. We move through our days in a series of linear segments, each one leading to the next. \n\nEach segment has its territory with its own rules and way of doing things. We are constantly shifting from one to the next, and the sum of these segments defines our existence. \n\nArt can help us visualize this hidden aspect of ourselves and feel its impact. Using Javascript to describe the sporadic nature of the world, this project invites us to see the linear segmentarity at work in our environment.\n",

It's about seeing the potential for art in the most unexpected places and creating something new from what already exists.\n\nOne thing we love about art is that it can be a direct expression of our thoughts and feelings. But what about the happy accidents that can happen when we let go and allow the materials to guide us?\n\nI love the serendipitous moments that arise when I relinquish control, letting the materials show me the way. The printmaking process can be messy and unpredictable. I often use sheets of notebook paper to keep my workspace clean. When I‚Äôm done, I save some of the scrap sheets of paper. \n\nThe mark of a dirty brayer, drips of paint, a coffee stain, or a ripped edge can all be embraced as part of the final composition. A similar process happens in generative art, where projects can have near limitless possibilities.\n\nSheets of paper can represent many things: a blank slate, an adventure, or even noise. This project is dedicated to all the leftovers and forgotten things in the world. It's a reminder that even the smallest piece of paper can be beautiful.",

Perspective and perception can be so different.\n\nBased on some of my photos from the last 365 days that trigger emotional memories, even if they are not directly connected. By the way, Fischbach is the name of the small village where I grew up. It was a great time!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach piece uses pairs of photos and colors (top/bottom).\n\nThe animated collage itself is based on two layers. The first layer uses a double buffer to cut, colorize and animate the photos. The second layer is mainly just for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nCutting and pasting photos is based on a variable moving color grid, the fixed horizon, the variable position of the photos top/bottom, the previous buffer and some magic distance calculations between them.\n\nThe grid itself is a combination of vertical color stripes with variable position and distance factors that determine the color gradient between the two colors, and folds that alternate between the two colors depending on the horizontal and vertical values.\n\nEspecially the entropy of the photos and the colored grid influence the pixel movement.\n\nAnimation changes are triggered after a random number of frames and effect folds, stripes and photo position. These replace parts of the current collage (fade to black) or add some (discard fragment updates).\n\nFeatures:\n\n- top color [12] - hue, colorful & bright\n- bottom color [6] - hue, less colorful & bright\n- top photo [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ‚ô†4, driften, brand-pyramide, z√§pfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- bottom photo: [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ‚ô†4, driften, brand-pyramide, z√§pfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- horizon [0.618, 0.5, 0.382] (down, center, up)\n- hectic [3, 5, 11] (calm, slightly, very)\n- horizontal folds [113, 365, 997, 2153, 3987] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- vertical folds [7, 37, 127, 571, 1501, 3147] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- min stripes [1, 3, 5] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 300 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar, mouse click or tap touch to trigger animation changes\n- `c` to take a picture\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `p` to pause\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- autopause - enable automatic pausing\n- pixelratio=2 - sets the pixel ratio (default: device)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=10 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

            "description": "This series is about finding the beauty in discarded things. It's about seeing the potential for art in the most unexpected places and creating something new from what already exists.\n\nOne thing we love about art is that it can be a direct expression of our thoughts and feelings. But what about the happy accidents that can happen when we let go and allow the materials to guide us?\n\nI love the serendipitous moments that arise when I relinquish control, letting the materials show me the way. The printmaking process can be messy and unpredictable. I often use sheets of notebook paper to keep my workspace clean. When I‚Äôm done, I save some of the scrap sheets of paper. \n\nThe mark of a dirty brayer, drips of paint, a coffee stain, or a ripped edge can all be embraced as part of the final composition. A similar process happens in generative art, where projects can have near limitless possibilities.\n\nSheets of paper can represent many things: a blank slate, an adventure, or even noise. This project is dedicated to all the leftovers and forgotten things in the world. It's a reminder that even the smallest piece of paper can be beautiful.",
