            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

At other times, they crowd together riotously, conspiring to sneak off the sides altogether.\n\n\"Brinco\" (Portuguese for \"I play\") is about celebrating finding joy in my creative pursuits again; about not overthinking it and simply following what makes me happy.\n\nCreative joy can be capricious, leaving us when we need it the most. We hope we can relate to our artistic practice in a positive way, tapping into what feels like a bottomless source of energy and excitement. But sometimes when life becomes overwhelming, what gave you energy before now feels hollow and rote—just one more thing sapping at you, and an emptiness where creative passion once resided.\n\nFor over a year, I've been sitting in this shadow. Until one day, I sat down and started tinkering… and for the first time in such a long time, I started to feel the spark.\n\nI hope that viewers and collectors feel that same spark of joy and playfulness when seeing these pieces that I've felt creating them.\n\nPress \"s\"/\"S\" to save a PNG at the current size and press \"h\"/\"H\" to save a high resolution version.",

            "description": "\n\n\nDigitally crafted flowers in pots for virtual window sills.\n\nIn the spirit of the piranha plant from the Mario Bros videogame. We wanted to create a project that acknowledges the playful depiction of nature in early videogames by creating a retro futuristic collectible that explores aesthetics over gameplay, whilst preserving the playful energy of these early digital worlds. There are many game elements that have emerged over the years that have become iconic in their own right. Their memorable designs have come to represent the exciting feeling of when we first discovered these worlds, but over time an appreciation for their simple design execution, harmony and balance has emerged. Art can exist in many forms and places including a digital pot plant.\n\nRarity:\n\nThere are a total of 23 hand-drawn and animated sprites divided into 4 groups Firelillies, Flytraps, Quasars and Stargazers and there are 15 possible combinations made from these 4 groups. 18% of the collection is a combination of these 4 groups which we can call random and the remaining 72% is divided between the remaining 14 combinations.\n\n\nThere are 3 possible grid systems 1x1, 3x3 and 4x4 \n\n3% 1x1\n\n40% 3x3\n\n57% 4x4\n\n\n\nThere are 14 possible placement points for all grids and 76 stem/sprite arragement in total\n\n\n\nFor the pots and stems there are 11 colors to choose and  no rarities for color combinations.\n\n\n\nThe flower distribution can be either symmetric or random. 35% symmetric and 65% random\n\n\n\nExport options:\n\nPressing 's' on desktop or holding for 2 seconds will download gif to whatever the current device resolution is. To export at a different resolution open the token in new window by clicking 'open' link under the token image and add \"&exportsize=1080\" or \"&exportsize=2160\" to end of the url and hit enter then either hold for 2 seconds or press 's' to create gif and download.\n\n\n\n ",

            "description": "\n\n\nDigitally crafted flowers in pots for virtual window sills.\n\nIn the spirit of the piranha plant from the Mario Bros videogame. We wanted to create a project that acknowledges the playful depiction of nature in early videogames by creating a retro futuristic collectible that explores aesthetics over gameplay, whilst preserving the playful energy of these early digital worlds. There are many game elements that have emerged over the years that have become iconic in their own right. Their memorable designs have come to represent the exciting feeling of when we first discovered these worlds, but over time an appreciation for their simple design execution, harmony and balance has emerged. Art can exist in many forms and places including a digital pot plant.\n\nRarity:\n\nThere are a total of 23 hand-drawn and animated sprites divided into 4 groups Firelillies, Flytraps, Quasars and Stargazers and there are 15 possible combinations made from these 4 groups. 18% of the collection is a combination of these 4 groups which we can call random and the remaining 72% is divided between the remaining 14 combinations.\n\n\nThere are 3 possible grid systems 1x1, 3x3 and 4x4 \n\n3% 1x1\n\n40% 3x3\n\n57% 4x4\n\n\n\nThere are 14 possible placement points for all grids and 76 stem/sprite arragement in total\n\n\n\nFor the pots and stems there are 11 colors to choose and  no rarities for color combinations.\n\n\n\nThe flower distribution can be either symmetric or random. 35% symmetric and 65% random\n\n\n\nExport options:\n\nPressing 's' on desktop or holding for 2 seconds will download gif to whatever the current device resolution is. To export at a different resolution open the token in new window by clicking 'open' link under the token image and add \"&exportsize=1080\" or \"&exportsize=2160\" to end of the url and hit enter then either hold for 2 seconds or press 's' to create gif and download.\n\n\n\n ",
