            "description": "Direction determination refers to the ways in which a cardinal direction can be determined in navigation and wayfinding. The most direct method is using a compass, but indirect methods exist, based on the sun, the moon, the stars. It helped humans to explore the world as we know it.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'Cardinal directions' is inspired by minimalism and express natural human predisposition to explore the world. Our curiosity led as to where we are now. We explored the nature that surrounds us and were able to adapt to various circumstances. We overcome difficulties and used it to our favor.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe collection consists of 4 different geographical areas - mountains, woods, seas and plains. Each area has its own unique element - a monument created by humans as a symbol of how we adapt in different places.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeographical areas: Mountains, Woods, Seas, Plains;\nMonuments: Castles, Watch Towers, Lighthouses, Windmills;\nDaytime: Day, Night;\nMoon phase: Full, Waxing, Waning;\nWeather: Dusky, Cloudy, Clear;\nSky objects: Stars, Shooting Star, Birds;\nLegendary creature: Sea Snake (Rare).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResolution: 2000x2000 px\nPress [s] to download the piece as a png file\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Feb 2023\nArtist: Jidoari",

It combines physics simulation with artistic visualization, offering versatile tools for creating dynamic, whimsically lifelike forms and interactions in 3D.\n\nProtoByte.ts\nRelease notes:\n\nAs I begin to release #genart projects like Scyphozoa.01, and soon enough the ProtoByte.ts library itself, I thought it would be useful to share my thoughts and hopes for the project. \n\nI plan to vary minor and major releases in alignment with library development. This drop reflects a minor (though quite significant personally) internal release. Minor releases will generally have more affordable pricing and larger editions.\n\nProject Goals:\n1.  Release a fun, distinct and highly useable library, with advanced behavior for creative coding that supports existing core libs such as @threejs, @p5jsArt, @processingOrg, @babylonjs.\n\n2. Develop and nurture a userbase that both create with and contribute to the overall ProtoByte.ts project.\n\n3. Develop supporting pedagogy to continue my 30 year odyssey in #creativecoding. \n\n4. Continue to contribute to the mission for increased adoption, growth and value of Web3 as a major creative space/art marketplace. ",

            "description": "\n\"Polako\" means \"slowly\" in Montenegrin. When I first came here, the word I heard most often when I wanted to do something with someone or ask them for something was \"Polako.\" In the culture I grew up in, everything happened very quickly and was results-oriented. In my new city, it's the opposite. Things may move slowly, requiring patience, but the aim is for better results. Perhaps they're right; the longevity of quickly done things is debatable. Our contemporary culture is like that too, everything is based on consumption. Art fields are also affected by this trend. Many artists or works without a past become popular with instant attention and then disappear after a while. This is sad in the long run. But when artists who don't get the recognition they deserve face these situations, they question themselves and their art, feeling inadequate and unsuccessful. As someone who has experienced this a lot, I am a keen observer. But speed is not necessary. What's important is to be lasting. Yes, this is very difficult. It's really hard to endure life and make your production sustainable. I must be patient. I need to mature my ideas. Slower, more polako. Surely, our art will be appreciated. There is a hidden connection between slowness and faith.\n\nIn this collection, I have returned to my architectural world once again. I have designed new compositions for depth. I moved away from colors and focused on textures. I tried to draw attention to changing animations in the background and spontaneously formed pixel layouts in the foreground.\n\n*Start and stop animation: press 'Q'\n*Save image: press 'W' to save the current image as a PNG.\n*Fullscreen mode: press 'E'\n----------------------------------------------------------\nPolako © 2024 by NUBPLUS is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 ",

The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "'Murals' is a collection of 256 abstract compositions born out of an intense period diving deeply into street art, pointillism and the inner workings of neural networks.\n\nThe work explores projection, refraction and abstraction of points as they ripple through multi-dimensional space-time. Points refract through multi-dimensional space to become shapes, which then become coordinate systems for the projections of new points that create a sense of form, texture, lighting, and material properties. \n\nThe work is also a celebration of imperfections and how a combination of many tiny – almost individually imperceptibly small – imperfect details can shape our perceptions of form, materiality, mood. This is explored within this work through subtle uses of sprays, flecks, scuffs, cuts, grain, targets (projections of projections), construction lines, base projections, occasional glitches that cause curvature, bounced light, shadows, and more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n15 colour palettes: \nScream, Night Bus, Double Backflip, Jaws, Sunday, Atom, Space, Tipex, \nGraphite, Leaf, Earth, Bubble Gum, Citrus, Jellyfish, Damp Concrete.\n\n4 times of day (that create subtle changes in light colour):\nDaylight, Winter Morning, Midnight, Sunset\n\n2 Border types: \nNormal, Thin\n\nVarious features that subtly impact appearance surface textures and shard forms:\nMetallic, Engrave, Number of Shards, Scuff Marks, Symmetry. \n\nControls:\n- Press [ S ] to save the work at its current image size as a PNG.\n- Press [ 1 ] to set the image size to 1440 x 1944 pixels (default size)\n- Press [ 2 ] to set the image size to 2880 x 3888 pixels\n- Press [ 3 ] to set the image size to 4320 x 5832 pixels\n\n- Press [ F ] to toggle freeform mode to create custom image sizes and aspect ratios\n- Press [ R ] to reload the image (for use in freeform mode)\n\nThis work has been tested on Chrome and Safari on Mac OS, and also using an Android smartphone. Please make sure that it works on your device before minting. Based on testing (in May 2022), each work should take about 5-10 seconds to fully load on a laptop or desktop machine, and 15-20 seconds on a mobile device.

            "description": "\"MOUNTAINS\" is a work that belongs to the \"FLUX Series\", which utilizes the same techniques and processes as the previous work \"FLUX\". The shape in this piece is created by placing elements using noise and then performing recursive pixel operations on these elements.\n\nThe inspiration behind this work came from my continued sketches and studies of Flow Field, which led me to discover an expression of objects that seemed to be corroding. I believed that by applying this technique, I could create a realistic and vivid sculpture from a geometric shape.In this work, this corrosion treatment is applied to a geometric triangular shape of overlapping rectangles to form a realistic and dynamic mountain landscape.\nIt was as if geometric figures like Plato's \"ideas\" were materialized in the real world.\n\nAdditionally,  I was also inspired by the mountain views from my hometown at New Year's and by the manga background paintings of Yoshiharu Tsuge, who specializes in depicting villages with old hot springs.\n\nIt is possible to get a 5760 x 3240 px png file by right click save.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries.\n\nArtwork by hasaqui, @hasaqui.\nMade with p5js\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n",

The Game of Life is a zero-player game, its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.\n\nMaps of Life is a generative-player game, an algorithm that creates an initial random configuration and a collector that observes how the configuration evolves. Each mint produces a distinctly unique cartographic representation of an ideal town, with different color palettes, scales, and coordinates, an animation from its random birth to a stopped moment in time.\n\nMaps of Life assumes that the built environment has a life of its own. And besides, only an automatic mind can name towns with Butterfly Names. Enjoy the view.\n\n---\nInteractivity:\nPress LEFT and RIGHT arrows to speed-up or slow-down the evolution of the town.\nPress \"S\" to save the current state to a PNG image.\nIf you want to change the resolution, just add \"?res=XXX\" to the end of the url.\n---\n\n(With these keys, you can possibly force the script to continue until its further completion. Could you get a deserted landscape?)",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines II. Enfantillages Pittoresques” is the second of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Enfantillages Pittoresques” experiments with predefined plots, colour blending, webgl shaders, and generative music; all with a fresh, childish style. This algorithm has been trained to draw basic shapes in accordance to Satie’s lyrics. However, it uses them in unusual ways and creates what looks like fantastic creatures, microscopic beings, or, to follow Corneille, Constant, and Appel: \"human animals\".\n\n“It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child” Attributed to Picasso (falsely, probably)\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines” are best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, these have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\nPress M or Double Tap (mobile) for AUDIO mode\nWait for SILENT mode\nPress I for Trait Info (desktop)\nPress 1 for Canvas Save (desktop)\n\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=171” after URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=X” for HQ renders (standard is 2, and 8 produces 400ppi 40x44cm prints).\n\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been compressed and minified for a performance boost, but can be read fully in GitHub: https://github.com/ratchitect/\n\n\n# PERFORMANCE\nBetter experienced with Chrome.",

A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

            "description": "There is a place in a remote village with only forest and huge meadows and hills around it. I used to spend a few days there in the summer. This year it has become my retreat for the whole summer. There is silence around and no persistent explosions from the bombing. I wanted to use this time to relax and reflect.\n\nWhen I began working on the project, I had no specific goals in my mind. I didn't set myself any tasks, didn't commit to any deadlines. Suddenly, I found something that reminded me of blooming meadows, it was in tune with my state at that moment. So I started to develop this theme. I did not aim to turn it into a realistic picture. The images were supposed to remain abstract, just to convey the general mood and impressions I was feeling.\n \nInitially, it was a story about summer meadows and grasses. But in the process, I had memories of impressions that arose in different seasons, which I observed in nature here. Colour became the main conductor of the story about various states of nature. It is common to see a lot of black soil in spring through which fresh shoots break through, creating bright splashes on a dark background. During the early summer, the area is covered in lush grasses and wildflowers, as well as butterflies. The world blooms and life is reborn. Eventually, the grasses wither due to the hot sun. Sun-burnt straw sheaves take on a special beauty and texture.  As autumn approaches, we turn to the terracotta range, which offers a variety of ripe mature flowers. Winter is all about graphics. During this period, I usually like to take black and white pictures. Every time, every state of nature has its own beauty. As well as every period of our life.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nPlease pay attention: for rendering the project you might need a rather powerful CPU. Depending on your equipment, it may take several seconds to several minutes for the process to complete. \n\nThe project was tested on different browsers; it works best in Chrome. Please make sure the project works on your device.\n\nPlease be aware, if you are minting with Safari or Firefox for Mac, a live preview image may differ slightly from a captured image.\n\nThe final resolution of the saved output depends on the size of your browser window. \n\nTo save a high resolution image add &scale=(and then a number from 4 to 12) to the end of the URL when in live mode. For example, &scale=6. \n\nPress ’s’ to save the image.\n\nTo save an output with a density higher than 9 (or resolution more than 4319x7680) use Firefox for PC or Safari for Mac. Please be aware that it might take more time to generate a higher density output even on a powerful computer, so please be patient.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nOlga Fradina (Live Minting Experience at Unit London), 2023\nMade with p5.js and GLSL.\n\n\n",
