The UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity beautifully states, “As a source of exchange, innovation and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature.”  Who better to usher in an age of true appreciation for, and active promotion of cultural diversity than a community of artists and collectors.\n\nExcerpts from the UNESCO declaration are embedded in the piece in the form of asemic writing, infusing the piece with the power of the message as it charms the eye.  The collector will also be able to select one of twenty affirmations to be embedded in the work.  Each minted edition will stand as a prayer flag waving permanently on the blockchain spreading its message of belief in a world where we are all valued and respected.  Cry Diversity will be free to collect, but it comes with a challenge.  The collector is expected to actively research the cryptoArt community to find an artist new to them that is a member of an underrepresented group (female, LBGTQIA2+, female identifying, non-binary, POC, global south, etc.).  They are then expected to actively promote that artist and their work for at least one week.  They are expected to personally raise their voice.  Cry Diversity is the second in a series of projects (see the companion piece fx(elevate)) designed to bring attention to individual artists as well as to the value of true commitment to diversity within our community.  It will not be the last.\n\nIt is time to make our cries heard and our actions felt!\n\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint a free edition.  Beginning in the 2nd week, the project will be open to the public for an additional week. Un-minted editions will be burned at the expiration of the 2nd week.\n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Choose your Cry.  Lock it.\n4) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \na) Seed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you have recorded the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the seed to retrieve it.\nb) Cry: What do you want our community to symbolize?  Respect, diversity, compassion?  Choose your favorite characteristic.  It will be baked into your output.\n\nProject Details:\nThis work uses the spectral.js library for the development of color palettes. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in June, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.

            "description": "Whoever played marbles? \n\nSmall balls are played with a finger flick to hit other marbles. It is said that this game originated from the civilization of Ancient Egypt in 3000 BC (BC). When I was a kid, this game was still popular. I often watch and even play with my friends. We are very focused when we want to snap our fingers at the marbles, full of strategy, and square off. This is just a nostalgic paragraph, and that's enough for that. Because today, marble game events are not seen much.\n\nSo, in this work is the imagination of the oversupply of marbles due to the cultural changes experienced by children nowadays who are very sucked in by gadgets rather than games that can hone social, environmental, and motor skills.\n\nPress ’s’ on the live mode after 'zoom-out' the live mode tab to save the high-quality screen capture.\n\nn.b. The smaller the zoom percentage, the higher the image quality you will get.\n\nMade using Hydra (https://hydra.ojack.xyz/)\n\nlinxirwengi - 2023",

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",
