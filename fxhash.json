Due to an unfortunate error in the original piece Wandering Nets no longer displays live inside the current fxhash UI. This restored and updated generative token is offered free to all collectors of the original, with some additional tweaks and capabilities.\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nOriginal description as below:\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nWandering Nets is a digital kinetic light sculpture by Matt Ebb.\n\nNetworks of light are created and connected via random walks in space and colour. Emergent structures are revealed by the ambient interaction, tension and collision of these networks within themselves and orbiting shadowed spherical bodies.\n\nThe piece is the result of several months of custom development in realtime volume rendering. The scene data is generated in javascript and rendered with a bespoke GLSL raytracer - no external libraries are used.\n\nThis is a graphically intensive shader. By default it will adaptively adjust sampling quality to target 30fps, though a reasonably fast GPU is recommended for best results.\n\nMouse drag: Orbit the camera in 3D to explore compositions\n[ and ] keys: Override the adaptive samples per pixel lower or higher to trade noise for framerate\n\nMarch 2022\n\nUpdate -\nspacebar: Disturb the light positions  ",

            "description": "The story behind this collection is that there isn't really a story behind this collection. It is the result of play, tinkering, and curiosity.\n\nOne of the beautiful things about generative art is how we can achieve drastically different results simply by modifying a few parameters or lines of code. As my first release here on fxhash was 'Sabler', it felt fitting that my release for #fxhashturnsone would itself be a modified version of that 'Sabler' algorithm, albeit giving drastically different results.\n\nIt is notable for the fact that this is perhaps my most 'chaotic' collection yet, letting go of carefully considered proportions, angles and positioning and here leaving that in the hands of the computer. In a way, this simple act represents several design decisions I never would have imagined myself making a year ago, highlighting my growth as a generative artist over the past year.\n\nIt is also a reflection of the inspiration gained from many of the artists and boundary-pushers in the space that each time unlock and encourage creations beyond the immediate comfort zone. For that, this is a 'Thank You' to all of you.\n\nWith that, here's to many more years of generative beauty and inspiration on fxhash and beyond.\n\nAs with previous collections, I highly recommend viewing the images at full size and savouring the details and the chaos up close. Pressing 'S' will save a 6000 x 6000 px PNG file.\n\n50% of primary sales will be donated to the Processing Foundation.",

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px). It may last for high numbers.\nWe recommend the use of Chrome browser in order to render properly the texture.\n\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 × 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.net",

            "description": "Dencity is a generative art project inspired by aerial views of cities with a high density of buildings. Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "AERO\n\nIn the stillness of the void, floating cities hang suspended, bound by no earthly gravity. The buildings, wrought in shades of dreamy pastels, appear as though they have been plucked from some other time and place, and set adrift in a new and unknowable realm.\n\nHere, amidst the stillness and silence, ropes hang loosely like vines, connecting the structures in a delicate web of possibility. The architecture of the buildings is vaguely familiar, yet strangely surreal, hinting at a past now forgotten.\n\nAs the eye wanders through this landscape of suspended structures, a feeling of nostalgia begins to seep in. There is a sense that these cities were once inhabited, bustling with the energy of human life. Now, they stand alone, abandoned and forgotten, as nature slowly reclaims its territory.\n\n\n\nThe AERO series explores how a minimalistic set of shapes and rules can be extrapolated to create complex assemblies, the same way individual buildings will form villages and cities.\n\nTo add a sense of organic texture to these geometric structures, ropes that connect certain squares have been added. They can sometimes take on the appearance of vines. This addition aims creates a sense of tension between the man-made and the natural.\n\n\n\nDouble click or double tap to save the current image\n\nIn fullscreen mode / live view:\nAdd \"&size=xxxx\" at the end of the url to generate a custom sized image\nAdd \"&clean\" at the end of the url to remove the grain effect\n\n\nArtist: Estienne\nFeb. 2023\nLicense: NFT 2.0",

            "description": "\"I used to live in a small city placed at the center of Iran's plateau with the warmest summer days in the country part; spending most of my childhood with my sweet grandma at her old house. She was always keeping her eyes on me not to get heat stroke at noon playing in the yard when the sun was at its peak glowing furiously. Sundays at noon were my favorite, I used to call them “Ice cream” noons sitting beside the nicest person you could imagine and enjoying a delightful ice cream. You won't know how lovely it was to have an ice cream relaxing under the most enjoyable cold breeze of the tallest windcatcher in the city at her house. \"\n\n\n\nThe Badgirs city is the first collaboration between Fleep and IceRain on Fxhash. The concept was established first with the design of a school with a feeling of safe and nostalgia reminding us of the good memories of our childhood as the grandma’s house and the windcatcher for Fleep.\nA windcatcher (Badgir) is an Iranian traditional architectural element in the form of a small tower built on the roof of houses in warm locations to create passive cooling. The collection of Badgirs city is a modern recreational development of those traditional windcatchers designed by Fleep and icerain and exquisitely translated into code by Icerain.\n\nControls:\n[1] Set the resolution to Medium Resolution\n[2] Set the resolution to High Resolution",

            "description": "SCHNEEWALD is the second release in a row of about 12 tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years.\n\nThis project explores an approach to trees with snow using a recursive algorithm and includes Three traits: a density layer for the amount of trees and another layer for the amount snow and a third for how strong the branches bend.\n\nRendering progress indicated on the top left border\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png\n\nArtist notes:\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nI experienced it in all sorts of seasonal change, packed with snow is definitely among the most amazing! \n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: https://e-art.co/project/schneewald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND",
