            "description": "Laboratory of curious graphic studies.\n\nImagine an old file found near Weinar, containing the graphic research of a geometry enthusiast...\n\nA geometric figure with each side composed of a certain number of points (between 10 and 100) undergoes a rotation.\n\nA grain, or \"granularity\"  brings a pencil effect that gives the illusion of old archives rescued from a secret's Bauhaus laboratory. Old illustrations whose paper would have undergone the damage of time.\n\nFeatures:\n- Paper: yellowed, cracked and dry most of the time, but there were a few pages found with the marks of time bleached out.\n- Basic shape type: Polygons, sometimes stars. \n- Symmetry: Perfectly symmetrical geometrical shapes, but not always!\n- x' and y' : parameters for the deformation, based on the Lissajous equations. The value for x is very often 1, the other values are totally random between 1 and 10, but it seems that there are 30 too.\n- Length Loop : Time to draw the shape, usually 800 frames but we have seen some at 400 frames and others at 1600. \n- Granularity: 100 levels of granularity.\n- Sides or branches : Mostly between 3 and 5.\n- Points per sides or branches : around 50 (Gaussian Standard Deviation : 15).\n\nControls:\n[ENTER] to pause or restart playback.\n[s] to download the image*.\n\n*The maximum print size is limited by the resolution and power of your computer. See https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/how-to-print-generative-art to print at high resolutions.\n\nMade with the javascript framework P5.js\n\nJérôme Mercier - @generativePunk - https://www.pizza-punk.com \nDecember, 2022",

            "description": "Tema is the second in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art in the 1970s.\n\nAfter gaining some traction with his original collection RAM, Zajec and his collaborating programmer Matjaz Hmeljak undertook a more complex algorithm titled \"The Cube: Theme and Variation\" (or TVC). The program laid out 8 unique elements in a grid, creating a three-dimensional viewing of objects in space. They published a paper about the underlying algorithm, found at: http://www.edwardzajec.com/tvc4/pil1/index.html\n\nTVC was first printed in 1971, shortly after Zajec returned to Italy following his artistic studies in the US. It was programmed on an IBM 9044 & printed with a CalComp 563 plotter.\n\nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to save a high-resolution version of the image\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nBy @christine_hall",
