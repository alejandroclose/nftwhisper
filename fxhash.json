Final Urban Flora transformed into a study of abandoned structures of a long forgotten civilisation.\n\nThe whole image is generative and/or procedural. Leaves are parametric, twigs and trees use the space colonisation algorithm, and the geometry is based on platonic solids transformed though series of operations.\n\nFeatures determined at the time of minting:\n- one of the platonic solids or a prism\n- one of 15 geometry transformations\n- a color theme\n- leaves or detailed twigs\n- leaf's spread and the amount of ridges\n\n'g' / 'tree finger tap' - resolution and export\n'drag' - rotate\n'scroll' - zoom (on desktop)\n\nPlease note the project needs a decent GPU.\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n--\nWith dedication to my wife.",

            "description": "Quasiflock is a 2022 rework of a 2006 realtime animated generative system, originally one of the projects from which later my toxiclibs library collection and some other big client projects & brand identities grew out of. The piece was part of a long, multi-year investigation into particle systems, agents and the aesthetic of fluid dynamics. Even though the approach used here is very primitive, my overall aim was to create a dynamic (and minimally interactive/responsive) system, which is above all mesmerizing to watch and somewhat feels alive. Since the original Java/Processing version isn't able to run anymore, I did some major updates and ported it to Zig & WebAssembly to give it a new life, more fluidity and a larger audience. Hope you enjoy!\n\n10 parametric color themes (each with variations)\n10 macro design/behavioral params (to control dozens more)\noptionally mouse/touch responsive (rotate/pulsate)...\n\nMade w/ Zig, WASM & thi.ng/umbrella",

            "description": "Toccata is a piece about decay, about the impermanent. The emergence over time or, rather, progression of entropy is a key characteristic of our universe. Everything evolves to nothing. We as mortal beings have sometimes trouble reconciling with this idea. Humans have sought immortality for millennia, be it through ancient potions or modern medicine, be it from leaving a legacy that we feel will stand the test of time. It will, only to decay later than us.\n\nToccata is a piece about change. Change lies at the heart of human cognition and human nature. Our thoughts and our emotions happen over time, and are a function of the change that is both around us and at the very core of our selves. Change comes in nature in cycles. Seasons of growth, seasons of ripe fruits of life, seasons of decay, of death, rebirth.\n\nToccata is music. We find music to convey some of the deepest streams of human condition, connecting it to some other form of being. Music also happens over time, and music happens because of change. Music encodes our feelings better than any other aid we may have. Toccata incorporates this at its very core, as the main sound is Andreas' family piano where he learned to play, sampled this past July.\n\nRead more about the piece, and the collaboration between Marcelo and Andreas on andreasrau.eu/toccata\n\n---\n\nBasic controls:\n- Click on the piece or press spacebar to start it (WebAudio requires user intervention for the music to start). Once the music has started, again click or press spacebar to play/pause.\n- Press “s” to save a still at the current resolution\n- Press “r” to start recording a video at the current resolution, then “r” again to stop.\n\n---\n\nWebM audio-video recording performed using the library RecordRTC by https://muazkhan.com/, MIT licence.",

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5.

            "description": "Amidst the vibrant palettes and strokes that should effortlessly flow, there might arise a gnawing void, an expanse of white that feels overwhelming and infinite. A realm where every dab of color seems both too bold and too faint, a testament to a struggle that outsiders often romanticize but seldom truly comprehend.\n\nThe creative endeavor, no matter how noble or revered, isn't immune to the pangs of self-doubt and the pressures of perceived norms. The expectation of producing profoundness can sometimes feel like an anchor, threatening to pull you under the weight of what art is supposed to be. Consider perhaps the true essence of creation isn't just about the creation itself, but the myriad of emotions and vulnerabilities that shape it. It's about the journey of diving deep within, sifting through the chaos, and, in doing so, finding pockets of peace and clarity.\n\nWhile the world might insistently measure the value of your art by its reception by the crowd, its true worth lies in the sincerity of its expression. When the silence of the blank canvas gets deafening, remind yourself that the act of creating, with all its messiness and uncertainty, is a testament to your courage and strength. Sometimes, the mere act of picking up the brush, of engaging with the canvas, is a step forward, a silent, yet profound, triumph over doubt and fear.\n",

Genuary 2023 took place during the month of January 2023. Afterwards, as it happens, comes Genuary 32nd. This is an imaginary week, during which we develop one of our Genuary pieces into a 32 edition \"not very long\"-form generative project on fx(hash).\n\nMy Genuary 32nd project is based on Genuary 22nd: Shadows, the design of which again was based on the \"art deco\" pattern from day 20.\n\nThe patterns form a grid-like fence structure, dividing the space and creating an infinite cage. Light coming from the outside casts stark shadows on the floor. Several variations on halftoning techniques are used to portray tone, occasionally destroying depth perception into an abstract interplay of form.\n\nThe code of this piece has been diminished into a mere 3397 characters.\n\nYou can use the URL-parameter &m=2 as a resolution multiplier, to render images larger than your screen.\n\n(c) 2023 by Piter Pasma. https://piterpasma.nl",

            "description": "what is reality, really? Is it a fixed, objective truth, or a malleable construct of our own making?It's not on the celebration of technology's triumph, but a critique of its insidious influence on our understanding of the world. In an era where digital consumption mediate our every interaction, I ask: what lies beyond the glow of our devices? Do we truly see the world, or merely a curated simulation of it?\n\nThe product that I created through this token is a social commentary on how technology influence the way we perceive reality. Or shall I say we exchange reality with an alternate fleeting virtual one.\nThis piece aims to challenge the viewer's perception of reality, presenting a fractured and surreal world that blurs the lines between truth and fiction.\n\nCoded in javascript / P5JS.\nPlease be patient, as it may take for a while to generate.\nOnce rendered, press 'S' to download.\n\nCreated by: demzr7/dentro 2024",

Is it a fixed, objective truth, or a malleable construct of our own making?It's not on the celebration of technology's triumph, but a critique of its insidious influence on our understanding of the world. In an era where digital consumption mediate our every interaction, I ask: what lies beyond the glow of our devices? Do we truly see the world, or merely a curated simulation of it?\n\nThe product that I created through this token is a social commentary on how technology influence the way we perceive reality. Or shall I say we exchange reality with an alternate fleeting virtual one.\nThis piece aims to challenge the viewer's perception of reality, presenting a fractured and surreal world that blurs the lines between truth and fiction.\n\nCoded in javascript / P5JS.\nPlease be patient, as it may take for a while to generate.\nOnce rendered, press 'S' to download.\n\nCreated by: demzr7/dentro 2024",
