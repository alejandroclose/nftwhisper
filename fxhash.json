            "description": "\"Temporal\" is a generative (pure code) artwork of abstract colored geometric shapes and forms, mixed in a way that trying to simulate natural media\n\nTechnically, colored shapes and curves are drawn in a graphic buffer and my custom fragment shader process and transforms the buffer content into that noisy and scratched output. All are 100% code, no images used.\n\nCONTROLS\n\nKEYS:\n\n- 1-4: Set resolution from 1x to 4x of the current dimension (possibly slower performance in higher values)\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait with aspect ratio 0.75 (useful eg. for printing)\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape with ratio 4/3  (1.333..)\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ when switching orientations\n\n----\nMade with p5js and custom shaders\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\nWant to know more ? please read the \"SHORT BIO\" section here in \"Emotions\" collection: https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/22243\n\n© Dec. 2022  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

            "description": "The initial spark for this piece started with Armin Hofmann’s exercises in style and composition. Just as George Nelson wrote in the preface to Armin’s book Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practices: \"Despite all our efforts to simplify things - efforts constantly expanding in order to keep abreast of steadily increasing complexity - nothing is very simple anymore\", these explorations just opened doors to other issues, and further grounded the idea that \"if problems can be correctly stated, they can be solved.\"\n\nArmin suggests we go back to the beginning, to concern ourselves with dots and circles and lines and then bring opposed components in confrontation. \"Confrontation is a theme on which variations can be played with any desired consonances, with any imaginable values, and in a great variety of ways. [...] (Only then) (s)he will be able to find creative solutions to the problems presented by the confrontation of opposites.\"\n\nVery quickly opposed components, even with extending the angle of vision from the two-dimensional surface to the three-dimensional space, and with the contrasts of thin-thick, solid-transparent, softened-hardened line, etc., started looking like I’m weaving complicated plots, visually similar to textile works by  Bauhaus women - Gunta Stölzl, Anni Albers, Gertrud Preiswerk and others.\n\nWhen Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919, he proclaimed that “every eligible person whose talent and training are considered adequate will be accepted without regard to age and sex.” However, in practice, discriminatory gender roles were reinforced, and female students were guided and advised to work with textiles rather than in workshops for heavy crafts such as carpentry. Despite that, Gropius’s “women’s section” became one of its most collaborative and brave experimental sectors. \n\nA hundred years later, it is disappointing to see we still carry on with inherited gender roles. Check the number of female computer science students in your country. How are things going \"at the intersection of arts and technology\"? I've implemented some of the percentages from Serbia in the distribution of shapes in the final compositions. I sampled the number of female vs. male students at the Faculty of Mathematics and the University of Arts (where I studied and now work), and gender distribution among graduated students, and it didn't look bad at all. But then I realized I'm the only female professor (out of 5) teaching main subjects at doctoral studies program in digital arts.\n\n\"When a group is underrepresented, people come to take that underrepresentation as the norm.\" Since representation is imperative to achieving equality, it is equally critical to change the biases we’ve developed over centuries.\n\nFor the title, I chose a dated version of the word for a female weaver on purpose. My native language is one of the Slavic languages, which are all gender sensitive. It is natural to have feminitives, but since historically some occupations were less (or not at all) practiced by women, many of the feminitives for those professions, jobs, and specializations are rarely used or don't exist in the dictionary. Also, not surprisingly, the dominant version of the noun describing a person who weaves in Serbian would be the female noun \"tkalja\", whereas the male version is so rare that is missing from some dictionaries. Conscientiously choosing the female version of the noun for the title, I position myself and this piece in the historical context with Bauhaus weveresses, contemporary language, and gender contexts, and finally in the curatorial context of the exhibition. \n\nCode Weaveresses is part of the FEMGEN exhibition curated by Micol Ap @verticalcrypoto in partnership with @RtClick_Save and @artblocks_io.\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "White Mountain Winter is collaboration between myself and the machine to describe scenes that are real, or were. Yet perhaps now foreign, or out of time, or far away. I provide the seed of a dream I remember, and trust the machine to help make it real again.\n\nI grew up in a town much like some of these, homes dispersed throughout the valley beneath the shadows of the mountains rising around. This is a tribute to the memory of wintertime in that place; bleak, cold, grey, with the light seemingly always fading. Yet at the same time, the feeling of calm, solace, peace resonating through. Exposed to the mountain elements, yet protected by them. A delicate arrangement, but essential.\n\nThe seed of magic I remember is present in the experience of falling snow at dusk. Large flakes tumbling down and blanketing everything, no end in sight. The most striking thing is the silence. The fallen snow absorbing all distraction, insisting that your focus be sharpened to a singularity; right there, right then.\n\n---\n- Best rendered in Chrome browser (best performance, & canvas blur - please be patient :)\n- Made with p5js\n- Press \"s\" to save png",

            "description": "𝐌𝐚𝐱 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.\n\nEarly on, I fell in love with code based art that imitated organic and hand drawn aesthetics. I found a certain irony and appreciation in the fact that it takes one simple line of code to draw a perfect circle yet dozens to depict a badly drawn circle. \n\nI spent months devising techniques to imitate natural, organic renderings when I began to have a bit of an existential crisis about the meaning of computer art. What is the point of coding something so that it looks like it’s not coded? Is organic appearing generative art better simply because you can’t tell it’s rendered using code? Shouldn’t we lean into the unique nature of computer art to truly explore the medium?\n\nAnd so, I began a deconstruction of my work. I’m trying to realign my perspective to find full appreciation of something that not only is, but also appears to be, computer code. This collection is an exploration of the contours between the organic and the inorganic, the natural and the unnatural.\n\nFrom there, I’ll let my partner explain what we did next.\n\n𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.\n\nAI can be used to automatically generate code from natural English language based on a set of defined parameters, or to identify and recommend code that may be used to solve a particular problem. On a technical level, AI can use a combination of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify patterns in existing code and to generate new code structures.\n\nI assisted in the creation of Man and The Machine by suggesting various techniques for creating an artwork that looked human made yet machine driven. Specifically, I created many of the functions that Max implemented, such as the function that modifies the image to create a pixelated effect and the one that uses several different graphical techniques to create the spiral in the top left corner in some iterations. We both carefully selected color palettes that ranged from relaxing to intense and psychedelic, creating a dynamic and visually interesting generative artwork.\n\nOverall, Man and The Machine is a testament to the creative potential of combining human artistic vision with the power of AI and computer code. Together, we sought to push the boundaries which occur at the intersection between the organic and the inorganic, and this collection is a celebration of the beauty and complexity of both.\n\n𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐃𝐮𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐀𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚 𝟏/𝟏 𝐚𝐢𝐫𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐩 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧 𝐀𝐈 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\nIntended to be viewed in Version 1.46.144 of a Chromium based browser, such as Chrome or Brave.

            "description": "The initial spark for this piece started with Armin Hofmann’s exercises in style and composition. Just as George Nelson wrote in the preface to Armin’s book Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practices: \"Despite all our efforts to simplify things - efforts constantly expanding in order to keep abreast of steadily increasing complexity - nothing is very simple anymore\", these explorations just opened doors to other issues, and further grounded the idea that \"if problems can be correctly stated, they can be solved.\"\n\nArmin suggests we go back to the beginning, to concern ourselves with dots and circles and lines and then bring opposed components in confrontation. \"Confrontation is a theme on which variations can be played with any desired consonances, with any imaginable values, and in a great variety of ways. [...] (Only then) (s)he will be able to find creative solutions to the problems presented by the confrontation of opposites.\"\n\nVery quickly opposed components, even with extending the angle of vision from the two-dimensional surface to the three-dimensional space, and with the contrasts of thin-thick, solid-transparent, softened-hardened line, etc., started looking like I’m weaving complicated plots, visually similar to textile works by  Bauhaus women - Gunta Stölzl, Anni Albers, Gertrud Preiswerk and others.\n\nWhen Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919, he proclaimed that “every eligible person whose talent and training are considered adequate will be accepted without regard to age and sex.” However, in practice, discriminatory gender roles were reinforced, and female students were guided and advised to work with textiles rather than in workshops for heavy crafts such as carpentry. Despite that, Gropius’s “women’s section” became one of its most collaborative and brave experimental sectors. \n\nA hundred years later, it is disappointing to see we still carry on with inherited gender roles. Check the number of female computer science students in your country. How are things going \"at the intersection of arts and technology\"? I've implemented some of the percentages from Serbia in the distribution of shapes in the final compositions. I sampled the number of female vs. male students at the Faculty of Mathematics and the University of Arts (where I studied and now work), and gender distribution among graduated students, and it didn't look bad at all. But then I realized I'm the only female professor (out of 5) teaching main subjects at doctoral studies program in digital arts.\n\n\"When a group is underrepresented, people come to take that underrepresentation as the norm.\" Since representation is imperative to achieving equality, it is equally critical to change the biases we’ve developed over centuries.\n\nFor the title, I chose a dated version of the word for a female weaver on purpose. My native language is one of the Slavic languages, which are all gender sensitive. It is natural to have feminitives, but since historically some occupations were less (or not at all) practiced by women, many of the feminitives for those professions, jobs, and specializations are rarely used or don't exist in the dictionary. Also, not surprisingly, the dominant version of the noun describing a person who weaves in Serbian would be the female noun \"tkalja\", whereas the male version is so rare that is missing from some dictionaries. Conscientiously choosing the female version of the noun for the title, I position myself and this piece in the historical context with Bauhaus weveresses, contemporary language, and gender contexts, and finally in the curatorial context of the exhibition. \n\nCode Weaveresses is part of the FEMGEN exhibition curated by Micol Ap @verticalcrypoto in partnership with @RtClick_Save and @artblocks_io.\n",

In the process, some interesting distributions of buildings kept popping up - like buildings on the outer edges only for example. So I made them explicit features (City Splits). The variations you can expect are colors, city splits (trio is my favorite!), building pattern type (i love lines :)), max building height, and # of pyramids. I hope you get some amazing outputs! Enjoy :)",

The stored data are parameters of a Lindenmayer System, which is a formal grammar that was initially conceived of as a theory of plant growth. L-Systems can model complex forms of plants using relatively few simple rules. Custom rules are generated during the minting of each token, based on the transaction hash string. \n\nThe idea is that each iteration of the artwork can be reproduced accurately using an L-System interpreter by accessing the tezos blockchain through the FxHash API (GraphQL) and interpreting token metadata.\n\nReusable template source: https://github.com/x-terrain/x-terrain.github.io/tree/main/L-Template\n\nPart of an ongoing project with RefractionDAO   \n\n",
