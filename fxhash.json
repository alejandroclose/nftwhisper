            "description": "Inspired by traditional Japanese wagami design. We use the iconic patterns of our previous projects to recreate this artwork. All the patterns are generated first and then used to build the scene. \n\nIn this project Aluan brings his delicate texture from his 'Chaos' series, Jinyao brings his beloved pattern from the 'Cloud' series and Wen brings his iconic pattern from the 'Maze'. 'Collage' is not just about mixing our style, but it is also about finding harmony among all the elements. 'Collage' is also about working together, in that we can create something that's difficult to achieve or imagine if we were working alone.\n\nEach piece contains the patterns of all the 3 artists, each artist has a certain number of patterns with different colors. Depending which artist you get, his pattern will be shown as the primary color theme while the pattern of the other 2 artists turns into grayscale to make the primary pattern with color stand out. \n\nThere are 7 different scenes included in this project, which are : Mountains, Waves, Lake, Hexagons, Tetrapods, Chrysanthemums and Lotus. We took great inspiration from the traditional Japanese design, and we discovered these are some of the most common elements in it. Therefore we decide to use them and reimagine them by mixing our patterns. \n\nThe title 'Collage' doesn't only apply to the visual style, but also to the code as well. In this project we mixed p5.js and Vanilla JS. While Aluan and Jinyao work with their patterns in p5. Wen gathered the patterns and recreated the full scene in Vanilla JS.\n",

The game requires a starting configuration of \"living\" cells (all other cells are assumed to be \"dead\"), and at each discrete step forward in time, the following transformations occur:\n\n- Every living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n- Every living cell with more than three living neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n- Every living cell with exactly two or three living neighbors survives.\n- Every dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes to life, as if by reproduction.\n- Every dead cell without exactly three living neighbors remains dead.\n\nConway's Game of Life feels very simple at its outset. And yet, computer scientists have discovered a staggering degree of complexity, and a vast lexicon of dynamic forms, all within the bounds of its highly constrained 2D universe. It is Turing complete, meaning that given a large enough grid and an appropriate starting configuration, it's possible to create a functional computer inside Game of Life. Given unlimited processing power and memory, one could run Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life... ad infinitum.\n\nBut what would it look like for a small percentage of living cells on the grid, in the course of their \"lives\", to write some poetry?\n\nWhat if each living cell also could increment somehow at each time step it stayed alive, imbuing cells with a visible age?\n\n\"Life in The Waste Land\" is Conway's Game of Life applied to poetry -- more specifically, a poem: The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot.\n\nIn this implementation of Game of Life, the grid is monospaced text, and each living cell has a very small chance of generating a few lines, all entirely inspired by The Waste Land. Each token will track its unique starting configuration's progress forever. The grid is infinite, and the dynamic patterns extend far beyond the fixed boundaries of your screen. Some tokens will remain dynamic for a very long time, while others will settle down quickly, at which point continuously living cells may iterate through nearly every Unicode character.\n\nThank you for collecting.

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

            "description": "During the last couple of decades, over the air television signals and antennas switched to digital, bringing with them a new form of static and distortion as the signal is broken up. \"Over the Air\" is inspired by these digital distortions, incorporating aspects of them into the same grid-like structure seen on the television. Additional patterns are combined in the grid with these distortions to create the final artwork.\n\nPatterns for the individual blocks in the grid are divided into categories, and various amounts are picked for each work, with dozens of possible mixtures. Patterns can flow in different directions across the varied canvases. Distribution of these patterns across the grid varies from work to work, providing for different feels as they bunch together or spread apart.",

The most direct method is using a compass, but indirect methods exist, based on the sun, the moon, the stars.

Our curiosity led as to where we are now. We explored the nature that surrounds us and were able to adapt to various circumstances. We overcome difficulties and used it to our favor.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe collection consists of 4 different geographical areas - mountains, woods, seas and plains. Each area has its own unique element - a monument created by humans as a symbol of how we adapt in different places.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeographical areas: Mountains, Woods, Seas, Plains;\nMonuments: Castles, Watch Towers, Lighthouses, Windmills;\nDaytime: Day, Night;\nMoon phase: Full, Waxing, Waning;\nWeather: Dusky, Cloudy, Clear;\nSky objects: Stars, Shooting Star, Birds;\nLegendary creature: Sea Snake (Rare).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResolution: 2000x2000 px\nPress [s] to download the piece as a png file\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Feb 2023\nArtist: Jidoari",

            "description": "In 1970, mathematician John Conway devised his eponymous \"Game of Life\", also known simply as \"Life\", a cellular automaton that plays out on a 2D grid of orthogonal cells. The game requires a starting configuration of \"living\" cells (all other cells are assumed to be \"dead\"), and at each discrete step forward in time, the following transformations occur:\n\n- Every living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n- Every living cell with more than three living neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n- Every living cell with exactly two or three living neighbors survives.\n- Every dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes to life, as if by reproduction.\n- Every dead cell without exactly three living neighbors remains dead.\n\nConway's Game of Life feels very simple at its outset. And yet, computer scientists have discovered a staggering degree of complexity, and a vast lexicon of dynamic forms, all within the bounds of its highly constrained 2D universe. It is Turing complete, meaning that given a large enough grid and an appropriate starting configuration, it's possible to create a functional computer inside Game of Life. Given unlimited processing power and memory, one could run Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life... ad infinitum.\n\nBut what would it look like for a small percentage of living cells on the grid, in the course of their \"lives\", to write some poetry?\n\nWhat if each living cell also could increment somehow at each time step it stayed alive, imbuing cells with a visible age?\n\n\"Life in The Waste Land\" is Conway's Game of Life applied to poetry -- more specifically, a poem: The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot.\n\nIn this implementation of Game of Life, the grid is monospaced text, and each living cell has a very small chance of generating a few lines, all entirely inspired by The Waste Land. Each token will track its unique starting configuration's progress forever. The grid is infinite, and the dynamic patterns extend far beyond the fixed boundaries of your screen. Some tokens will remain dynamic for a very long time, while others will settle down quickly, at which point continuously living cells may iterate through nearly every Unicode character.\n\nThank you for collecting. Please enjoy.",
