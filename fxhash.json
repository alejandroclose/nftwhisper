Using them in the most cliche way possible, but trying to make something unique out of that.\n\nWhat started out as an innocent weekend project grew out to be quite the piece, which is why I am publishing it here.\n\n\n\nSweeping uses the GPU of your machine for its shading, which means it won't run particularly well on mobile devices. My recommended way of viewing this piece is on a PC with a dedicated GPU.\n\n---\n\n- Double Click to open a User Interface\n- In the UI, you can toggle the paper texture and export\n\n---\n\nMade with p5js + webgl by Wouter Missler, 2022.",

            "description": "Uninhabitable is a generative system built only from ellipses. The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state.

This work is an exploration in the philosophy of phenomenology to challenge our understanding of reality and truth and our attitude towards mental disorders and consciousness. What information does a folded letter give us? See the different variations of this token for a more complete understanding of the artwork. The text is based on psychological studies and their integration with various metaphors and references, unlike the previous work that used the text of Alice in Wonderland, to emphasize more on the phenomenological perspective and its connection with psychology, ambiguous and deep sentences that are randomly selected have been used. Is anyone really looking for the author of this letter? Can truth be different from reality? What is reality and what is its relationship with our perception of phenomena? These are some of the challenges that this artwork tries to create in our minds. \n\n----------- \n\nA few words about conceptual art and its relationship with this work and generative art:\nWhy should we value the combination of conceptual art with generative art? I've been dabbling in different styles of generative art for a while, and I've come to realize that conceptual art can add something to generative art. Conceptual art can bring the soul back to generative art and talk about deep concerns and concepts. As my friends have reminded me \"art should speak\" and this is very important in this regard and I hope this artwork will help in this matter. Share your thoughts about this artwork and this topic, it will always be a pleasure for me to read them.\n\nPress ’s’ on the live mode to save the artwork with high resolution.\n\nMade with P5js.",

This is my first generative NFT - a gnarly old tree. Source code was written in Scala.js with use of Three.js and ZIO. The algorithm is heavily inspired by l-systems (Lindenmayer systems), but has my own unique quirks. Sections of the tree grow and bend over time to create the final result. Being the first version of the algorithm, it is quite rough around the edges, but I hope you will agree that roughness creates a certain unique charm.",

            "description": "Boggle was inspired by a series of OP Art paintings done by Victor Vasarely, called Vonal-Fèny. (c. 1975). Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the forth in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nBrain Boggle is a multiple square arrangement of the original work. I was able to decipher Vasarely's painting into an algorithm and thereby generalize it. I can vary the number of points in each half of the square and I can rotate the square in 90 degree increments. I like putting the one of four rotational variations of the piece together in a 2x2 array. All the pointed shapes are one random color. To me the interactions between each section is more interesting than 4 instances at the same rotation angle. \n\nThe overall background is random, either a solid color or one of 4 types of linear gradients.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "This artwork is the result of my exploration in conceptual art and a continuation to one of my early works (conspiracy theory).\n\nThe idea was inspired by Conspiracy Walls. This work is an exploration in the philosophy of phenomenology to challenge our understanding of reality and truth and our attitude towards mental disorders and consciousness. What information does a folded letter give us? See the different variations of this token for a more complete understanding of the artwork. The text is based on psychological studies and their integration with various metaphors and references, unlike the previous work that used the text of Alice in Wonderland, to emphasize more on the phenomenological perspective and its connection with psychology, ambiguous and deep sentences that are randomly selected have been used. Is anyone really looking for the author of this letter? Can truth be different from reality? What is reality and what is its relationship with our perception of phenomena? These are some of the challenges that this artwork tries to create in our minds. \n\n----------- \n\nA few words about conceptual art and its relationship with this work and generative art:\nWhy should we value the combination of conceptual art with generative art? I've been dabbling in different styles of generative art for a while, and I've come to realize that conceptual art can add something to generative art. Conceptual art can bring the soul back to generative art and talk about deep concerns and concepts. As my friends have reminded me \"art should speak\" and this is very important in this regard and I hope this artwork will help in this matter. Share your thoughts about this artwork and this topic, it will always be a pleasure for me to read them.\n\nPress ’s’ on the live mode to save the artwork with high resolution.\n\nMade with P5js.",

            "description": "This 3D HTML + CSS based work utilizes only a limited amount of javascript to construct the scene and facilitate interactive controls. 🚫 <canvas>! Continuing the collab with my alternate identity HTMLCSS.TEZ\n\nThe practice of layering many graphic shapes and gradients with a chaotic mix of blending modes has been with me since my first years of photoshop in my youth. It's a familiar, friendly technique. Yet, I've rarely played with it outside photoshop. Here I take the opportunity to apply this abstract blending technique in a manner that alludes to reality: refracting crystals.\n\nThese generated crystals are not based in fact but imagination. They are illustrative of the magic and wonder some people associate with real life minerals and rocks. They blend together with impossible color changes only possible in the virtual.\n\nEach individual crystal element can be one of these blend modes (with chance):\ndifference (9/16), exclusion (2/16), hard-light (2/16), color-dodge (1/16), overlay (1/16), normal (1/16)\n\nControls:\nPlay/Pause - [Space]\nRotate - [Click + Drag]\nMove - [Shit + Click + Drag]\n\nMinter's Reward: 1/3 Secondary royalties",

It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

As a result, some of the outputs might be weird, messy, or even bordering on broken (if you get one of the latter please let me know and I'll reimburse you).\n\nDespite being a bit rough around the edges, I hope fx(mash) reflects some measure of my love for the fxhash community. If you're feeling kind, then perhaps it even harks back to the experimental early days :)\n\nThe last year has been an incredible journey, thank you for letting me be a part of our story so far.\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press [s] to save the current image\n- Press [g] to toggle grain\n- Press [h] for a high-res output\n\nBeta Controls (in live view, definitely not fully tested):\n\n- Press [p] to start/pause animation\n- Press [i] to slow down animation\n- Press [o] to speed up animation\n\nAll primary sales go to Savepakistan.\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nfx(mash) uses Gorilla Sun's grain implementation, a big thanks to him and meezwhite for a great article that is well worth supporting https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/all-about-that-grain\n\nThank you to the artists who created the following collections.
