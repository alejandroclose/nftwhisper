            "description": "Thoughtscapes: A Kaleidoscope of Emotions\" is an abstract painting that artfully conveys the intricate relationship between thoughts and feelings. The canvas becomes a canvas of the mind, where emotions and thoughts blend and clash in a symphony of color and form. The bold strokes and rich palette evoke a wide range of feelings. It's an invitation to delve into the kaleidoscope of emotions that shape our lives and reflect upon the beauty that emerges when thoughts and feelings merge on the canvas of our existence.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nThe collection is made in pure code with p5.js.\n\nThe piece is my first work being published.

            "description": "Mudaashiku (「無駄足区」- “Fool’s Errand District”) invokes the place where you first really experienced what it means to be a person in a city. Were you awestruck? Did you feel lost or disoriented by a realization of the size of the spaces around you? Perhaps you sought some detail, some small thing to focus on to reorient yourself and feel like a person again in the face of such immensity and confusion.\n\nThis work is inspired by an attempt to capture some of the feeling I had when I first moved to Tokyo and was utterly overwhelmed. It was both exciting and frightening to suddenly be lost in a place so immense and unfamiliar. If Stendhal Syndrome refers to the fearful ecstasy of experiencing the beauties of Florence, then there must be something similar for the first experience of a great city. This work attempts only to point in the direction of such a feeling.\n\nTake a moment to experience the district as a whole, but then, with a change of perception, your focus may shift to the individual building or group of buildings. And then, back again. This duality of scales has been integral to the development of the work.\n\nThe work expresses eight features:\nAspect ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.41, 1.41:1, 1.2:1\nEnvironment: Central (most common), north river, east river, south causeway, west causeway (most rare).\nPalette: Thirty seven selected palettes. Chosen either for their aesthetic qualities, or as an attempted expression of some element of urban life.\nDivisions: 15, 18, or 21.\nColor variance: 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36, 0.54.\nSun direction: East or west.\nLocale: Either central or commuter town. Determines the height profile of the district.\nRoads: Represented, or not.\n\nThe work begins by gradually revealing the layout of the district. This process can take from about 6 seconds to as much as 2 minutes, but 50 to 60 seconds is typical. When this process is complete, the colors and facades will be added and the work revealed.\n\nOnce the work is complete, it can be adjusted using the following controls:\n\n[0] Fit size to window (default)\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels\n[4] Set shortest edge to 8000 pixels (please be patient!)\n\nAfter changing the dimensions, the work may appear the same size in your browser. The new dimensions will be apparent when you save an image.\n\n[s] Save work at current dimensions\n[b] Add or remove border\n[g] Add or remove background grain\n\nMade in 100% vanilla javascript.\nOpenSimplexNoise.js used for noise.\n",

Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

Perhaps you sought some detail, some small thing to focus on to reorient yourself and feel like a person again in the face of such immensity and confusion.\n\nThis work is inspired by an attempt to capture some of the feeling I had when I first moved to Tokyo and was utterly overwhelmed. It was both exciting and frightening to suddenly be lost in a place so immense and unfamiliar. If Stendhal Syndrome refers to the fearful ecstasy of experiencing the beauties of Florence, then there must be something similar for the first experience of a great city. This work attempts only to point in the direction of such a feeling.\n\nTake a moment to experience the district as a whole, but then, with a change of perception, your focus may shift to the individual building or group of buildings. And then, back again. This duality of scales has been integral to the development of the work.\n\nThe work expresses eight features:\nAspect ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.41, 1.41:1, 1.2:1\nEnvironment: Central (most common), north river, east river, south causeway, west causeway (most rare).\nPalette: Thirty seven selected palettes. Chosen either for their aesthetic qualities, or as an attempted expression of some element of urban life.\nDivisions: 15, 18, or 21.\nColor variance: 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36, 0.54.\nSun direction: East or west.\nLocale: Either central or commuter town. Determines the height profile of the district.\nRoads: Represented, or not.\n\nThe work begins by gradually revealing the layout of the district. This process can take from about 6 seconds to as much as 2 minutes, but 50 to 60 seconds is typical. When this process is complete, the colors and facades will be added and the work revealed.\n\nOnce the work is complete, it can be adjusted using the following controls:\n\n[0] Fit size to window (default)\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels\n[4] Set shortest edge to 8000 pixels (please be patient!)\n\nAfter changing the dimensions, the work may appear the same size in your browser. The new dimensions will be apparent when you save an image.\n\n[s] Save work at current dimensions\n[b] Add or remove border\n[g] Add or remove background grain\n\nMade in 100% vanilla javascript.\nOpenSimplexNoise.js used for noise.\n",

It links a thousand pairs of points, harmoniously shifting across the canvas, with delicate lines. At each intersection of these lines, color is applied. To produce the final piece, multiple layers of varying colors and intensities are superimposed.\n\n------\n\nControls:\n\n- [x] Save a PNG\n\n- [1] Set height to 768\n- [2] Set height to 1152 \n- [3] Set height to 1536 (default)\n- [4] Set height to 2304\n- [5] Set height to 3072* \n- [6] Set height to 6144*\n- [7] Set height to 9216*\n- [8] Set height to 11520*\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render height\n\n\n* images with height over 3000 pixels render without animating, downloads a PNG automatically after rendering\n\nPlease note that high resolution outputs will take several minutes or even longer to render.

            "description": "In the creation of \"Asta,\" a tapestry of mathematical precision and mythological grandeur unfolds before the viewer. The name itself is an ode to the Old Norse term \"Ástríðr,\" which combines \"ás,\" or the divine, with \"fríðr,\" the beautiful. Much like the gods and goddesses of Norse mythology, \"Asta\" dwells in a space where disparate forces like unity and fragmentation or chaos and order find harmony.\n\nThe visual core of the artwork is composed of concentric circles meticulously shaped from individual spheres. Each circle, akin to the realms over which Norse gods presided, is a universe unto itself, yet all function as part of an overarching cosmic design. The deities of Norse lore were complex beings, embodying both virtues and flaws, and such dualities reverberate through each sphere and orbit within the piece.\n\nServing as a backdrop for this celestial assembly is a canvas marked by signs of distress and decay. This reflects the concept of entropy inherent in Norse cosmology—often symbolized by the serpent Jormungandr biting its own tail to form a circle. Circles that appear to have lost their center drift aimlessly, reminiscent of gods who have fallen from grace, thereby capturing the unpredictable and imperfect nature of existence.\n\n\"Asta\" is not merely a visual spectacle; it's an invitation to embark on a philosophical exploration. As viewers traverse the delicate balance between intricate patterns and intentional anomalies, they are compelled to confront the eternal dualities symbolized in Norse mythology—such as order and chaos, the finite and the infinite, and the divine and the mortal.\n\nFor those who engage with it, \"Asta\" serves as more than just an art piece. It becomes a poetic meeting with the sublime and a tribute to the complexities that both life and mythology bestow upon the human experience.\n\nControls\n========\nThe controls are as follows:\n- Press `t` - 370 x 200 png output (thumbnail)\n- Press `1` - 650 x 1200 png output\n- Press `2` - 1300 x 2400 png output\n- Press `3` - 1950 x 3600 png output\n- Press `4` - 3250 x 6000 png output\n- Press `5` - 5200 x 9600 png output\n- Press `6` - 7800 x 14400 png output\n\nPlease note that the larger the output, the longer it will take to generate.",
