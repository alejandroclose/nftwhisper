We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\"Swarmachine\" is the closest thing to a useless machine that actually works. \nIn this dichotomy, a swarm of sensitive automatons can be seen carrying out complex cooperative work of misunderstood utility. From a strange coordination, the micro-square society builds its habitat. Influenced by each other, they relate from a sonorous dance. And this is how the swarm lives and reveals -finally- the essence of its own machinery: vestiges and ephemeral moments before leaving.\n\n4 main audiovisual gestures of sonorous dance:\n1. Basic loop\nEach square performs quadrangle movements. It begins and ends at the same point accompanied by a sound.\n2. Contact moment\nAppears when a square reaches a corner of its path and makes contact with another square.\n3. Gesture kamikaze-release\nSometimes these \"contact moments\" result in an impact between the two squares in question, transforming both into a single gesture of fusion, and subsequent release of the swarm.\n4. Queen loop\nAppears when the queen is sighted. Main square that keeps the essence of the machinery.\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js. All sounds are synths programmed in the tone.js library.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

It's difficult for me to concentrate, especially when it comes to learning new things like p5.js. Despite the difficulty, I pushed through and managed to grasp the concepts, which was a significant accomplishment for me. To commemorate this personal milestone, I chose to incorporate the theme of focus into my first generative art token.\n\nDrawing inspiration from my childhood hobbies, I decided to represent the concept of focus by stacking stones on top of each other. As a child, I found joy in this activity, and it served as a metaphor for the determination and concentration required to overcome challenges.\n\nIn addition to my personal connection, I also drew inspiration from the Japanese culture of zen, concentration, and focus. The overall theme of my generative art token reflects these principles, paying homage to the mindset of finding inner peace and clarity through focus and concentration.\n\nBy combining my personal journey with the symbolism of stacked stones and the Japanese culture of zen, I hope to convey the importance of focus and celebrate the achievement of overcoming obstacles, especially for individuals like myself who face unique challenges in maintaining concentration.\n\nPlease press ‘2’ to ‘7’ to change the resolution (max 5600 × 7000 px).\nUse the key ’S’ to save the output as a PNG file.

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

It's difficult for me to concentrate, especially when it comes to learning new things like p5.js. Despite the difficulty, I pushed through and managed to grasp the concepts, which was a significant accomplishment for me. To commemorate this personal milestone, I chose to incorporate the theme of focus into my first generative art token.\n\nDrawing inspiration from my childhood hobbies, I decided to represent the concept of focus by stacking stones on top of each other. As a child, I found joy in this activity, and it served as a metaphor for the determination and concentration required to overcome challenges.\n\nIn addition to my personal connection, I also drew inspiration from the Japanese culture of zen, concentration, and focus. The overall theme of my generative art token reflects these principles, paying homage to the mindset of finding inner peace and clarity through focus and concentration.\n\nBy combining my personal journey with the symbolism of stacked stones and the Japanese culture of zen, I hope to convey the importance of focus and celebrate the achievement of overcoming obstacles, especially for individuals like myself who face unique challenges in maintaining concentration.\n\nPlease press ‘2’ to ‘7’ to change the resolution (max 5600 × 7000 px).\nUse the key ’S’ to save the output as a PNG file.
