When light enters the tube, it is reflected by the mirrors, creating a symmetrical image of the object or glass fragment placed at the end of the cylinder.\n\nThe result is a series of reflected images that repeat in geometric patterns, creating a mesmerizing visual effect.

            "description": "A kaleidoscope is an object that consists of a tube or cylinder with a set of mirrors inside, which reflect symmetrical images of colored objects or glass fragments. When you look through the viewer of the kaleidoscope, these images multiply into complex and fascinating patterns.\n\nThe reflections in the kaleidoscope are created by the mirrors inside the cylinder. Typically, there are three or four mirrors, which are placed at specific angles to create the reflected patterns. When light enters the tube, it is reflected by the mirrors, creating a symmetrical image of the object or glass fragment placed at the end of the cylinder.\n\nThe result is a series of reflected images that repeat in geometric patterns, creating a mesmerizing visual effect. Each time you rotate the kaleidoscope, the images transform into new and surprising combinations of colors and shapes.\n\nIn summary, a kaleidoscope is a tool that creates fascinating and colorful reflective images. The reflections are created by the mirrors inside the cylinder and multiply into complex and symmetrical patterns. It's a great way to explore the properties of light and color while creating visually appealing and mesmerizing images.\n\nIn this project, I drew inspiration from the mesmerizing reflections and variations that a kaleidoscope can create, as well as its simple yet elegant design. Using p5.js, I explored the potential for generating variations of Hydra, and experimented with integrating hex colors into the Hydra workflow.\n\nBy building on the concepts of the kaleidoscope, I aimed to create a unique and visually appealing project that showcases the beauty and complexity of reflective patterns. The addition of hex colors to Hydra brings an exciting new dimension to the project, allowing for a greater range of color variations and visual effects.\n\nOverall, this project represents an exploration of the intersection between art, technology, and design, and serves as a testament to the power of creative experimentation and exploration.\n\n\nAll profits make on this project will be donated tofamilies and homeless people affected by the disaster on the north coast of São Paulo.\n",

            "description": "A kaleidoscope is an object that consists of a tube or cylinder with a set of mirrors inside, which reflect symmetrical images of colored objects or glass fragments. When you look through the viewer of the kaleidoscope, these images multiply into complex and fascinating patterns.\n\nThe reflections in the kaleidoscope are created by the mirrors inside the cylinder. Typically, there are three or four mirrors, which are placed at specific angles to create the reflected patterns. When light enters the tube, it is reflected by the mirrors, creating a symmetrical image of the object or glass fragment placed at the end of the cylinder.\n\nThe result is a series of reflected images that repeat in geometric patterns, creating a mesmerizing visual effect. Each time you rotate the kaleidoscope, the images transform into new and surprising combinations of colors and shapes.\n\nIn summary, a kaleidoscope is a tool that creates fascinating and colorful reflective images. The reflections are created by the mirrors inside the cylinder and multiply into complex and symmetrical patterns. It's a great way to explore the properties of light and color while creating visually appealing and mesmerizing images.\n\nIn this project, I drew inspiration from the mesmerizing reflections and variations that a kaleidoscope can create, as well as its simple yet elegant design. Using p5.js, I explored the potential for generating variations of Hydra, and experimented with integrating hex colors into the Hydra workflow.\n\nBy building on the concepts of the kaleidoscope, I aimed to create a unique and visually appealing project that showcases the beauty and complexity of reflective patterns. The addition of hex colors to Hydra brings an exciting new dimension to the project, allowing for a greater range of color variations and visual effects.\n\nOverall, this project represents an exploration of the intersection between art, technology, and design, and serves as a testament to the power of creative experimentation and exploration.\n\n\nAll profits make on this project will be donated tofamilies and homeless people affected by the disaster on the north coast of São Paulo.\n",

            "description": "The first blueprint was found in 1947 on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.\nIt has been studied several times.\nNumerous theories arose trying to explain its origin.\nNone of them was decided conclusively.\n\nOne year ago, a rare group of waves coming from space was intercepted on earth.\nThis happened during the 2021 summer.\nIt was unclear if they were born from natural events.\nDying stars, black holes... Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n—--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n—--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n—--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022.
