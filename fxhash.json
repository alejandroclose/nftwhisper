Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": ">>> GAN ⫷glitch⫸ Ting Xu |  幹亭序 <<<\n\n• Generative glitch collage: More than simply a + b + c •\n\n\nAt the apex of Chinese calligraphy, Lantingji Xu, the preface, was written by the most renowned calligrapher in China, Wang Xizhi (王羲之).\n\nDuring the Spring Purification Ceremony, forty-two literati gathered along the banks of a coursing stream and engaged in a \"winding stream\" drinking contest: cups of wine were floated on the water upstream, and whenever a cup stopped in front of a guest, they had to compose a poem or otherwise drink the wine. At the end of the day, twenty-six literati composed thirty-seven poems in total and the Lantingji Xu, as a preface to the collection, was produced by Wang on the spot.\n\nIn the GTX collection, we create new intricate and expressive relationships between ink, paper, and pixels using Jimi's raw calligraphy work, their GAN offsprings, and Thomas's CHX-like glitch processing, generating unique calligraphy on mint and toasting at the same time.\n\n\nHow it works:\n\nCombining sets of raw layers that range from paintings, calligraphy, and GAN seeds, our algorithm applies an array of image processing magic, creating intricate novel outputs.\n\nWe have 102 raw layers separated into four groups. Each final output is formed by mixing and processing four randomly selected layers. \n\nGroup 1 contains textures, and it is composed of Jimi's paintings, GAN seeds from mixed custom models, and CLIP Guided Diffusions. \n\nGroup 2 contains Jimi's calligraphy work. \n\nGroup 3 contains GAN calligraphy seeds from custom models we trained on Jimi's body of work. \n\nGroup 4 contains digital grain textures.\nOur algorithm starts by selecting one layer from each group, assigning them sizes, opacities, orientations, and other parameters. Then it sets a dithering combination to be applied. We have eight combos formed by combining seven different custom dithering algorithms (3 at a time). \n\nAfter each dither gets applied to its corresponding layer, images get mixed using different blend modes to help combine them in fun ways. Afterwards, a couple more filters get applied to glue everything together. When all is said and done, final artworks get rendered onto the canvas.\n\nSit back, open the live view, and enjoy. \n\n\nAppreciate the art, not the speculation. Pay what you can. \n\nWith love, sweat, and tears –drops– \nJimi and Thomas.\n\n\nJimi's notes:\n\nI provided the calligraphy representing the extreme spectrum of my expression in brushwork and poetry. I also evaluated the GAN calligraphy outputs, helping Thomas hone the models. During the training process I was horrified and in awe by both the stupidity and sometimes brilliance of the GANs.\n\nThrough the layering techniques developed by Thomas, I have also gained new insights into calligraphy, taking it beyond brush, ink and paper. The spectrum of expression in calligraphy gets freed from traditional constraints in GTX. Fx(hash) calligraphy has become brush, code and screen. \n\nThomas does not read Chinese, but I was happy to let him crop my scrolls into square layers in ways he saw fit with the project's aesthetic. To my surprise, I did not only agree with his visual choices but also noticed how the illiterate crops had many Freudian slips. That is, my poetry made sense fractally. I think this is no coincidence for calligraphers that write their poetry. Calligraphy is more than the sum of beautiful brushstrokes and also greater than the sum of pretty characters. Calligraphy is the composition of space and semantics. Only in turn does meaning takes its place in parts of calligraphy. \n\n\nControls:\n[s] save as PNG.\n\n\nPaint / Ink / Photography –> GANs / Diffusions –> p5.js –> Blockchain\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2022 Thomas Noya and Jimi Wen\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n◉_◉ ◉_◉",

With each iteration appears a new densely built city block. Graced with impeccable geometrical lines, devoid of any human presence, these buildings remind us of brutalist utopias like Le Corbusier’s Cité radieuse or Niemeyer’s Brasilia. But despite their clearly modernist feel, there is something hauntingly primitive about them. They could be either New Mexican adobe pueblos, Minoan palaces, or Turkish troglodyte dwellings. Both carved and sculpted, these Ghormenghasts of concrete float in a realm out of time, like in some architect’s dream.\n\nThe purpose of this creative work is to generate 3D architectural projects that could be implemented in the real world. The accelerating lives that we live, complicated by growing and unpredictable environmental crises, call for an enhanced capacity to come up quickly with new architectural solutions adapted to different contexts. From computer assisted design to 3D printing, from augmented reality to real-life housing, from sculpture to architecture, this work aims at bridging the gap between the virtual and the tangible.\n\nWorking as a visual artist, David Umemoto draws inspiration from his training as an architect. He has been using low-tech methods for a long time, refining his talent for elegant simple shapes and combinatory constructions. Now, poured concrete and home-made moulds are giving way to zero-gravity rotating models. The skills he developed while working with real objects find a new playground in the virtual realm.\n",

            "description": "# Los Osos 2422\n\nI was working on the next EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",
