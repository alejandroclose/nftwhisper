            "description": "“We are segmented from all around and in every direction. The human being is a segmentary animal. Segmentarity is inherent to all the strata composing us. Dwelling, getting around, working, playing: life is spatially and socially segmented. The house is segmented according to its rooms’ assigned purposes; streets, according to the order of the city; the factory, according to the nature of the work and operations performed in it. We are segmented in a binary fashion, following the great major dualist oppositions: social classes, but also men-women, adult-children, and so on.” \n\n-a thousand plateaus: capitalism and schizophrenia, Deleuze and Guattari\n\nLinear Segmentarity explores the concept of a segmented existence, which refers to how our lives are broken up into discreet parts or segments.\n\nI was inspired by the philosophers Deleuze and Guattari. These thinkers studied the ways we are segmented into work and play, family and friends, and past and present. We move through our days in a series of linear segments, each one leading to the next. \n\nEach segment has its territory with its own rules and way of doing things. We are constantly shifting from one to the next, and the sum of these segments defines our existence. \n\nArt can help us visualize this hidden aspect of ourselves and feel its impact. Using Javascript to describe the sporadic nature of the world, this project invites us to see the linear segmentarity at work in our environment.\n",

Using p5js, I create collage-like images that resemble abandoned cityscapes on alien planets. The project is named 'Curtains' as it represents the final curtain call for these once-thriving societies. Through the use of painterly effects, I aimed to depict a sense of decay and loss in these apocalyptic landscapes while also leaving room for interpretation and imagination. \n\nThe project serves as a reminder of our own fragility as a civilization and raises questions about the fate of our planet and our future. Some may see it as a cautionary tale about the dangers of complacency and environmental neglect, while others may see it as a reflection on the cyclical nature of life and the inevitability of change.\n\nOptions:\n\n- press 's' to save the PNG image of the current view\n- press 'd' to save a high-resolution PNG image (can be slow 🐢)\n\nCreated using p5.js\nsteppe_walker, January 2023",

A black hole is literally a tear in the fabric of spacetime. Such a thing can only be created by the collapse of a massive star–or possibly by a dark star. \n\nIn philosophical terms, a black hole is a place where everything is pulled into a single point. It is the end of all things; the mind becomes totalitarian, and the self is lost.\n\nDark stars and black holes may represent an ending–a finality–but generative art is a beginning. Generative projects have the potential to change the way we think about art and life.\n\nArt can be one way that our consciousness avoids falling into a black hole. By appreciating the beauty in nature, we can find hope and avoid becoming trapped in an endless abyss. \n\nSo it is with generative art; from the darkness of a black hole, from the mystery of a dark star, new ideas and new ways of seeing the world are born.\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the image.\n",

            "description": "In \"Constructions Mentales\" (Mental Constructions), every detail is a metaphor, every element a window into the labyrinths of our inner world. The work appears as a chaotic cluster of eroded, disordered architectural structures piled atop one another, resembling fragments of an ever-evolving edifice. The worn and damaged elements, though enduring, evoke the resilience of the mental constructions within us, even when marked by time and trials.\n\nThese structures symbolize the memories, experiences, and conditioning accumulated over a lifetime. Each brick, each crack tells a story: of social expectations, cultural demands, family norms, and emotional wounds that have shaped our being. These pillars, often built without our consent, reflect obsolete and ineffective patterns of thought that we continue to carry, like invisible burdens.\n\nThe barred windows, with prisoners standing behind them, represent the limiting beliefs and deep-seated fears that confine us within our own minds. They highlight the influence of social and familial conditioning, intangible yet powerfully shaping our choices and perceptions.\n\nThe scattered figures within the work add depth to this symbolism. Those curled up or sitting against walls embody repressed emotions, parts of ourselves we have learned to ignore, and pains we choose to silence. The hanging figure symbolizes sacrifice or moments of stagnation following hardship—a pause forced upon us to reconsider our perspectives and aspirations.\n\nThus, \"Constructions Mentales\" transcends the mere depiction of architectural chaos. It mirrors an inner chaos, unveiling the complex forces that shape our psyche and the ongoing struggle to integrate or transcend them. The piece invites the viewer to reflect, to reorganize their inner foundations, and to move toward a sense of freedom and transformation.\n\n-----\n\nA high-resolution version can be downloaded by appending \"&height=6000\" (or another desired value) to the URL.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

These images are a collision and reformation of ideas and conceptual histories between artists Nudoru and Sub Net. This dichotomy reminds us of the painting \"The Treachery of Images\" by René Magritte, where he paints a picture of a pipe but states underneath, \"ceci n'est pas une pipe\" (This is not a pipe), meaning that there is a schism between what a thing is and what it represents. What is unique about these works go beyond the images and text combinations themselves. It is about how images create new thoughts not by not pretending to be completely novel but that builds upon one another in a system of complex synthesis.\n\nThis token is part of the Floor Exhibit co-curated by the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC and Fort Gallery NFT.\n\nViewing in desktop Chrome is recommended for the best results.\nPress' p' to pause/resume.\nPress' s' to save a screenshot.

            "description": "Cuts is an abstract representation of the exact moments in our lives when something is cut. It could be moving to a different country, being fired, quitting a bad habit, when a relationship ends or when you receive a very bad (or good!) news.\nBy themselves, cuts are not positive or negative events; it really depends on who you were before and who you wish to be after. But one thing is sure: every cut creates a new space that wasn’t there. This space could be small or huge, ordered or chaotic, regardless, you have to deal with it. Sometimes cuts try to resist and heal themselves extruding the core of the fibres we are made of, but they will fail. A cut is irreversible and it’s up to us to fill the gap with meaning.\n\nMain features include:\n- Curated palettes (21)\n- Drawing modes (3)\n- Extrusions (yes/no)\n- Orientation (3)\n- Overlapping (yes/no)\n- Covered area (2)\n- Cut position (2)\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [s] to save a 2400x2400 px image\n- Press [t] to toggle shading (sometimes flat colours rock!)\n- Press [c] to see copyright notice\n- Press [f] to log features in console\n\nBy Todemashi 2022\nNFT License 2.0\n\n### NOTES\nMade with p5js and GLSL shaders.\nShaders are based on tutorials and code by Patricio Gonzalez Vivo - The Book of Shaders - https://thebookofshaders.com/",

In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

            "description": "Take your entire life, full as it is with the vastness of your lived experiences – and shape it into your cupped hands. Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",
