            "description": "Growth patterns, version 2. January 2022\nEdition of 512\n\nGrowth v02 is an generative exploration of patterns in the style of William Morris' iconic wallpaper designs from the 1800s. The code for the Growth series was originally designed to create plausible road networks but has been rewritten to create more organic curved forms. Created with p5js.\n\n'space' to pause the simulation\n'h' to toggle to higher res (increases canvas size but runs slower: great for screengrabs)\n'r' to reset the seed (some features are locked to the original hash)\n's' to save an image to disk\nAll generated patterns are tile-able horizontally and vertically.\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\nThis project relies heavily on randomly generated values. It has been thoroughly tested. However, there is always the chance that the wrong combination of randomness can create less-compelling growth. If you feel you version is not living up to the potential promised with this piece, please email me.",

Now that I’m a part of your tez fam, please open me in live view, enter ‘9’ or ‘10’, wait, press ‘P’, print me, put me on your wall, and enjoy.\n__\n\nClew is a generative art collection designed for your wall.\n\nWhen opening live view, you’ll be prompted to choose a render quality (1 for lowest; 10 for highest). The higher quality renders are for printing and zooming in to choose your own sub-composition or explore the details/depth. Higher quality images will naturally take longer to render but will be worth the wait. If you find a partial render particularly nice, you can press spacebar to pause (and unpause) the render. Save a PNG by pressing ‘P’ or a JPEG with ‘J’. Medium and high quality renders are optimized for Chrome desktop and may not function on other browsers or mobile devices.\n\nThe processing length varies considerably, depending on the assigned traits. Therefore, not all previews will reflect the final output.\n\ncreated using p5js\n\nClew\nabstractment, 2022",

            "description": "Gerhard is a collaboration of Richard Nadler and Leander Herzog on fxhash. A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time. \nRichard Nadler created the textures to control composition and color. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels. This collaboration is enabled by twitter and fxhash, as the generative art community continues to explore abstraction in summer 2022 – while extreme temperatures, wildfires, ongoing conflicts and volatile markets continue to escalate. \n\n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color. \n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen mode. \n- Press “s” to save the current canvas. \n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nhttps://leanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/",

            "description": "GuilCity is the beginning of an exciting journey bringing Guillaume Cornet’s densely-packed cities into the generative realm with the help of Matthew’s (@frostbitten’s) magic touch.\n\nMatthew—with his background in coding and animation—enables a new opportunity to experience these cities like never before. Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey! \n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you’ve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n—\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n—\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n• https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n—\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others’ skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci à tous!

            "description": "This could be a follow-up to Herbert W. Franke's finding of interesting connections between Constructivism and Generative art, where at first, technological limits allowed only simple line drawings, based on fixed proportions, and later were extended by the use of random generators. Constructivism, as an art movement, sought to depict modern civilization, the symbiotic relationship between technology and art, industrialization, and urban spaces. Iakov Chernikhov (Яков Чернихов), an architect and graphic artist, was one of the influential figures in Constructivism. He extensively used the two-point perspective with an observation point below the ground in his drawings. \n\nIn this (my) exploration of two-point perspective, random, colorful, and glassy constructions visual resemblance to Chernikhov’s oeuvre is inescapable. Therefore the title is a play on the original title of his book Architectural Fantasies: 101 Compositions in Color, 101 Architectural Miniatures from 1933.\n\nThe subtle grain effect is done with p5.grain library by Gorilla Sun (@gorillasu) & meezwhite (@meezwhite). \n\nLook out for the FOMO keyboard key to unlock more variations.",

            "description": "A forest has stories to tell.\nAbout times that were, about times that will be.\n-\nThis project was minted in much unusual conditions. \nWe gathered here, by 38 degrees heat. We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "What Is Brutalism?\nBrutalism is a style of architecture that lasted from the 1950s-1970s, and it was characterized by simple, block-like, hulking concrete structures, with an emphasis on materials, textures and construction, producing highly expressive forms.\n\nThe buildings are characterised by their massive, monolithic and ‘blocky’ appearance with a rigid geometric style and large-scale use of poured concrete.\n\nBrutalism began to fade out in the 1980s, where it increasingly came to be regarded as cold, alienating and unfit for humans. It turned out that concrete had an allure of indestructibility but deteriorated from the inside, making it difficult to maintain and prone to crumbling and water damage as it aged.\n\nIn the years since, the world has been divided into those who think that Brutalist buildings are eyesores that should be demolished and those who find these vintage but not yet historic buildings architectural masterpieces to be cherished and preserved. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the work:\nThis work was built entirely with code using only math, logic and 2D shapes to create light, shadow and perspective.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nFeatures:\n\"Canvas Orientation\": Square, Portrait\n\"Building Size\": Large, Medium, Small\n\"Time of day\": Day, Night\n\"Sun/Moon\": True, False\n\"Palette\": 23 palettes\n\"Floors\": 3, 4\n\"Clouds\": True, False\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nConstrols in live mode:\nOn desktop: Press 's' or 'S' to save as PNG (2622x3720 or 3720x3720)\nOn mobile: Touch the screen to save as PNG (2622x3720 or 3720x3720)\n\nArtwork created with p5.js and love.\nNovember-December 2022",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

            "description": "Let me take you places. Those are not in your town, not even on your planet. They’re placed somewhere between reality and subconsciousness.\nEnormous, peculiar structures emerge upon you, refusing to be ignored. They are your unfulfilled cravings or ever-lurking demons. They were always there, under your skin, intangible, now they’ve materialized.\nYou may not like them, they may seem too vast, too scary to tame. But ultimately, you have to face them, unless you enjoy living in their shadow. \n\n___\nInspirations\n\nI’ve never truly realized that, but ever since I remember, the sight of gigantic objects or creatures evoked strong emotions within me.\nIt probably started with playing Shadow of Colossus (a video game) as a kid and seeing The Cathedral (short movie by Tomasz Bagiński). Years later, reading Solaris (by Stanisław Lem) aroused the same feeling (among others) of being mesmerized by the vastness. More recently, movies like Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival (which also nudged my attraction to mystery) and Dune - have charmed me.\n\nEarlier this year I have stumbled across Dawid Planeta (artist and yoga teacher) and began contemplating his visions of mini people in the jungle inhabited by giant animals. These works in particular, plus Hollow - generative series by Jacek Markusiewicz - were probably my final inspirations to make Intangible look the way it does.\n\nSettling semi-random generative structures in some kind of reality, gave them a meaning - they may symbolize things much bigger than you - the ones you try to escape from or those you’ve been longing to experience for years. I have mine, don’t you?\n\n___\nControls in live mode\n\n\nKeyboard\n[ space ] - toggle light animation\n[ S ] - save image with current size (default is 120% of browser window’s height; you may change browser’s scale or check URL size param)\n[ F ] - fullscreen \n[ up / down ] - light intensity\n[ left / right ] - base light position\n[ 1..5 ] - aspect ratio: 10:16 („zero” ratio), 1:1.4142 (vertical A4), 1:1, 1.4142 (horizontal A4), 16:10\n[ B ] - toggle border\n[ Z ] - toggle canvas „raw” mode - no shadow / margin (auto applied in fullscreen mode)\n[ N ] - toggle „that thing you may not want on print”\n\n\nURL params\nYou may add any number of parameters to the URL to start it with particular settings. \n[ animate ] (1/0) - toggle light animation\n[ size] (number) - number of px for longer edge, i.e. 4000\n[ ratio ] (number or ratio with format: 10/16, 10:16, 10_16) - aspect ratio\n[ light ] (number 40..120, some palettes have slightly different limits for good results) - light intensity\n[ lightShift] (number -100..100) - base light position\n[ border ] (1/0) - toggle border\n[ hddcy ] (0/1)\n\nExample: [ &size=4000&border=1&light=100&animate=1 ] \n\n\nMobile\n[hold 2 fingers for 2s] - save\n[double tap] - fullscreen\n\n\n___\nNote:\nI encourage you to do some light adjustments before you save an image for print. I’m pretty sure you can do better than fxrand().\n\n\n___\nSpecial thanks to my brother Krzycho, for lots of advices / heathy criticism and to Olga, for never-ending excitement and „dorady”.\n\n___\nDeveloped in Javascript, using p5.js (2D Canvas) and chroma.js.\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n© April-July 2022, MadeUpLifeforms (mulf)\n",

According to the Law of Conservation of Matter, the total amount of matter in a closed system stays constant over time, only changing its form. Some living creatures have been luckier than others, as we can still find remnants of organisms from millions of years ago, serving as silent witnesses to mankind’s flourishing.\n\nYet, the human race is exploiting the planet at an unprecedented pace. We are depleting its resources, polluting its atmosphere, producing hazardous materials, disrupting the natural balance of all things. We are causing harm while still expecting the earth to nurture and delight us. We’re just a small dot on the timeline, and yet so much damage has been done.\n\nThrough this project, I humbly attempt to create imitations of fossils and other forms of natural matter. These made up forms may appear attractive, reminding us of nature, but what emotion would they evoke in a natureless world, built of concrete, iron, and plastic?\n\nWhat do we leave behind?\n\n\n___\n20% of the primary sales go directly to One Earth, non-profit organization working to counteract the climate crisis in multiple, innovative ways.\n\n___\nTechnical notes:\n\n- By default, an output image size is based on your browser size (x1.25, with a maximum of 1800) - The script is quite heavy, so it may take some time on higher resolutions (but it’s worth it)\n\nDesktop controls:\n- To change the output resolution, use [1..6] on your keyboard (1250..7200px, roughly A5..A0 print sizes on 300dpi) or [0] to restore the default \n- Press [S] to save the current image\n- Press [F] to switch fullscreen mode\n\nMobile controls:\n- Hold two fingers for 2s to save\n- Tap twice to switch fullscreen mode\n\nURL params\n- Add `&density=[number]` (0.5..1) to change calculated field’s density (default is 0.65)\n- Add `&size=[number]` (1..6) to render with desired resolution \n- Add `&save=1` to save image when ready\n\n___\nDeveloped in Javascript, using p5.js (2D Canvas) and chroma.js.\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n© February 2023, MadeUpLifeforms (mulf)\n",

            "description": "\"In the year of 3023 the planet Earth from which all humans descend, today is called 'EARTH01', it is so called because it was the first planet to be completely destroyed by humanity. During the last few years of this planet's existence, the human race used all its resources to find new habitable planets and ways to reach them.\n\nAfter long years of tireless research, they began to discover new places where they could survive and explore, and thus they migrated from planet to planet and formed human colonies for thousands of years. Then one day some of them arrived on a new planet to begin their colonization, in this place they found trees very similar to the ones they knew, through ancient records of their ancestors, to have existed on EARTH01.\n\nBut unlike the trees on EARTH01, these were gigantic and instead of just fruit, some species also produced many types of important resources for human survival, such as water (extracted from some types of fruit), and even precious ores similar to of your home planet. To grow and survive, trees needed nothing more than a specific light from that solar system, which was very plentiful on that planet. These trees were then named 'Bellatrix', which in Latin (an almost lost language of EARTH01) meant 'warrior'.\n\nWith this discovery they thought had in their hands an infinite power, and so they began the same cycle done on all other planets, sucking all possible resources without thinking about the possibility of them having an end.\nAfter a few hundred years the planet began to crumble due to exploitation, and all the chaos caused by humans due to their greed and selfishness turned against them. Few Bellatrixes were left alive, the few existing rivers on the planet dried up, the woods and forests before full of life and those wonderful trees, no longer existed...\n\nSociety was in decline, laws no longer had effect on this civilization, there were groups of marauders, living there was no longer something safe. That planet full of life was now a desert planet, surrounded by sand dunes that swallowed the ruins of ancient buildings.\nIt was then that people realized that the same mistake had been made for all these thousands of years, generation after generation, no matter how fertile the new planet was, humanity always managed to deplete it and its resources. But it was too late, this civilization no longer had enough resources for them to leave this planet.\n\nWith that, a movement began for the preservation of these trees and the creation of complexes where people and Bellatrixes could live in safety, away from looters and other dangers now common in this place. The complexes were formed by units, which were raised many meters high to hinder the action of invaders, they were like small and large cities, but now far from the ground. These units were supported by small central columns, the more units and Bellatrixes in the complex, the more powerful and populous it was.\n\nAnd that's how they lived for many years, in these complexes there were rules and each one had their own specific ones, and they worked autonomously. Utilizing the resources obtained through the Bellatrixes and finally understanding their importance, they were able to keep the population alive and continue their civilization.\"\n\nThis is a record found in the diary of an unidentified space traveler and the only existing record of civilization on this planet.\n\n------------------------------------\nAbout the work:\nThis work was built entirely with code using only math, logic and 2D shapes to create light, shadow and perspective.\n\n------------------------------------\nFeatures:\n\"Palette\": 23 Palettes\n\"Units\": 1 > 45\n\"Bellatrixes\": 0 > 135\n\"Resource level\": Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High\n\"Population\": Very Small, Small, Medium, High, Very High\n\"Clouds\": True, False\n\"Sun/Moon\": Sun, Moon, False\n\n------------------------------------\nConstrols in live mode:\nOn desktop: Press 's' or 'S' to save as PNG (2534x3596)\nOn mobile: Touch the screen to save as PNG (2534x3596)\n\nArtwork created with p5.js and love.\nFebruary-March 2023",
