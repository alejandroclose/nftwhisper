            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "Inspired and fascinated by Brutalism, Modernism and Bauhaus, I've started to explore the deeper connections of architecture using pixel art in a clean, minimalistic and unique way.\n\nThe BRUTALIST MOVEMENT project represents the next step in this process. It's an animated generative experiment that focuses on finding the simplest and fewest components that - when generated randomly - always create structures resembling buildings: from small modern houses through industrial facilities to gigantic brutalist monuments.\n\nThis resulted in 4 main components: Base, Extension, Gap and Window. These entities are used randomly to create Blocks that form the final structure. \nThe whole process is also strictly accompanied by 4 distinct components to hold colors and to be set by randomly chosen palettes: Sky, Sun, Shadow, Window.\n\nFeatures consist of a mixture of the above components.\n\nThe project is animated to show how the buildings come to life. It's also a nice way to show what's going on in the background, because from time to time a bigger block would surely hide interesting smaller ones :) \n\nPress these keys:\n's' - to download a larger resolution PNG\n'n' - to shuffle through the 'depth' of Blocks, aka placing them from front to back and vice versa. This is a nice feature to show structures hidden by others and also a cool way to create iterations inside the iteration - sub-iterations - we can say :)\n'r' - to reset the Blocks' depths to default\n\nPlease note:\nEverything you see is generated, animated and drawn real-time. No layered transparent PNGs, PFP or similar!\n\nHave fun and inspiration!\n\n\n@cloudnoise © 2022\n\n☁︎\n\nCreated with P5.js library.",

            "description": "Decadence should not be misunderstood. Over time, the word has had various meanings (political and cultural) but has also been associated with Symbolism and Aestheticism.\n\nThe contemporary definition of decadence emerged in the late 19th century and praised artifice over nature, sophistication over simplicity, at the same time defying contemporary discourse of decline by embracing subjects and styles that critics considered over-refined. \n\nNowadays, decadence also refers to stagnation and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of material prosperity and technological development which leads to an excessive indulgence in pleasure or luxury.\n\nIn this context, Decadence is a reflection on the collaboration between Jerome Herr and David Mrugala (thedotisblack). A collaboration that started several months ago with a simple grid of random values, that soon became an experiment of creativity, always in the search of expectations, interest in excessive indulgence of visual pleasure, a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged in a series of generative images with an aesthetics that values excess – That is Decadence.\n\n- press 's' to save a standard image\n- press 'h' to save a high resolution image\n\nJerome Herr\n\nJerome Herr is from Luxembourg. Since 2015 he has created generative art with a passion for design and visual explorations. He is an active member of the creative coding community and a successful NFT artist, both on Teia and Fxhash.\n\nDavid Mrugala\n\nDavid is a German architect and intermedia artist, who lives in South Korea. He is the founder of thedotisblack, a platform and an archive for research design on (generative) drawings and animations made with code.",

            "description": "Decadence should not be misunderstood. Over time, the word has had various meanings (political and cultural) but has also been associated with Symbolism and Aestheticism.\n\nThe contemporary definition of decadence emerged in the late 19th century and praised artifice over nature, sophistication over simplicity, at the same time defying contemporary discourse of decline by embracing subjects and styles that critics considered over-refined. \n\nNowadays, decadence also refers to stagnation and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of material prosperity and technological development which leads to an excessive indulgence in pleasure or luxury.\n\nIn this context, Decadence is a reflection on the collaboration between Jerome Herr and David Mrugala (thedotisblack). A collaboration that started several months ago with a simple grid of random values, that soon became an experiment of creativity, always in the search of expectations, interest in excessive indulgence of visual pleasure, a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged in a series of generative images with an aesthetics that values excess – That is Decadence.\n\n- press 's' to save a standard image\n- press 'h' to save a high resolution image\n\nJerome Herr\n\nJerome Herr is from Luxembourg. Since 2015 he has created generative art with a passion for design and visual explorations. He is an active member of the creative coding community and a successful NFT artist, both on Teia and Fxhash.\n\nDavid Mrugala\n\nDavid is a German architect and intermedia artist, who lives in South Korea. He is the founder of thedotisblack, a platform and an archive for research design on (generative) drawings and animations made with code.",

It is recommended that you view the work in 4K or 6K to appreciate the finer details. \n\nThe keyboard buttons: “2”, “4”, and “6” can be pressed to change the resolution to 2K, 4K and 6K resolution accordingly. \n\nTo download an image at its current resolution, press the keyboard button “S”.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtwork created with p5.js\n\n@nbswwit\nSept 2022\n",

In this way, every detail of geometry in my daily life and in my other existing life attracts my attention.\n\nRecently, I have been doing research on colors and color palettes, it is really impressive how thousands of color mixtures affect each other and the psychology of living things!\n\n∽∽depending on the screen size you can get different resolutions, which brings out a different side of the project! so you can run this project on all screen sizes and get the output!∽∽\n\nKey:\n- Press \"s\" to export an PNG image\n\n\nMade with p5.js",

            "description": "Decadence should not be misunderstood. Over time, the word has had various meanings (political and cultural) but has also been associated with Symbolism and Aestheticism.\n\nThe contemporary definition of decadence emerged in the late 19th century and praised artifice over nature, sophistication over simplicity, at the same time defying contemporary discourse of decline by embracing subjects and styles that critics considered over-refined. \n\nNowadays, decadence also refers to stagnation and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of material prosperity and technological development which leads to an excessive indulgence in pleasure or luxury.\n\nIn this context, Decadence is a reflection on the collaboration between Jerome Herr and David Mrugala (thedotisblack). A collaboration that started several months ago with a simple grid of random values, that soon became an experiment of creativity, always in the search of expectations, interest in excessive indulgence of visual pleasure, a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged in a series of generative images with an aesthetics that values excess – That is Decadence.\n\n- press 's' to save a standard image\n- press 'h' to save a high resolution image\n\nJerome Herr\n\nJerome Herr is from Luxembourg. Since 2015 he has created generative art with a passion for design and visual explorations. He is an active member of the creative coding community and a successful NFT artist, both on Teia and Fxhash.\n\nDavid Mrugala\n\nDavid is a German architect and intermedia artist, who lives in South Korea. He is the founder of thedotisblack, a platform and an archive for research design on (generative) drawings and animations made with code.",

            "description": "Decadence should not be misunderstood. Over time, the word has had various meanings (political and cultural) but has also been associated with Symbolism and Aestheticism.\n\nThe contemporary definition of decadence emerged in the late 19th century and praised artifice over nature, sophistication over simplicity, at the same time defying contemporary discourse of decline by embracing subjects and styles that critics considered over-refined. \n\nNowadays, decadence also refers to stagnation and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of material prosperity and technological development which leads to an excessive indulgence in pleasure or luxury.\n\nIn this context, Decadence is a reflection on the collaboration between Jerome Herr and David Mrugala (thedotisblack). A collaboration that started several months ago with a simple grid of random values, that soon became an experiment of creativity, always in the search of expectations, interest in excessive indulgence of visual pleasure, a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged in a series of generative images with an aesthetics that values excess – That is Decadence.\n\n- press 's' to save a standard image\n- press 'h' to save a high resolution image\n\nJerome Herr\n\nJerome Herr is from Luxembourg. Since 2015 he has created generative art with a passion for design and visual explorations. He is an active member of the creative coding community and a successful NFT artist, both on Teia and Fxhash.\n\nDavid Mrugala\n\nDavid is a German architect and intermedia artist, who lives in South Korea. He is the founder of thedotisblack, a platform and an archive for research design on (generative) drawings and animations made with code.",
