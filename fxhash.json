            "description": "This is the second in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nThis work is a mark of progress. Christopher Scussel and I are working on modernizing MINI-EXPLOR. Chris is working on updating the engine from the original FORTRAN code of the 1970’s and its other limitations to usable JavaScript. In concert, I am analyzing and synthesizing the capabilities of the code and identifying an aesthetic. Together we continue to update EXPLOR and add new features.\n\nCPoSOP Composition is an original derivative work of Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids that was one of Knowlton’s original test examples. (Example 3)\n\nThe original EXPLOR picture frame was limited to a fixed array of 140 x 140 “characters.” Chris has rewritten the code to make the picture space variable. In this piece I increased the image space to a resolution 250 x 250  picture cells. Each picture cell is a 3x3 pixel block. \n\nThe EXPLOR functions are designed to interact with the current contents of each cell in the picture array. Every EXPLOR function has a rules parameter. In this test I’ve added a background. Thus when I draw my modified CPoSOP widget over the background it interacts with the color contents of a background cell or, the color of the cell based on a previously drawn widget.\n\nI’ve modified the original CPoSOP code and replaced constants with random variables. (made it a Spatial Force). I create a regular grid (Form of Spatial Organization) of a random size and draw the CPoSOP widget 85% of the time in one of the grid elements positions. The grid provides a structure to the image and the CPoSOP widget provides visual interest. The interaction of the widgets with the background and each other are amazing. \n\nIn keeping true to an EXPLOR vibe we use 4 color palettes. We let the computer randomly pick from three predefined palettes: Black and white. Four colors randomly chosen from set of 8 “Bauhaus” colors. And, four truly random colors.\n\nWe continue to honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT series. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored now updated by Scussel and Kolomyjec. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history with a modern twist.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nChristopher Scussel and I have collaborated to recreate a faithful translation of MINI-EXPLOR from its original FORTRAN and the limited graphics capabilities of output equipment of the day (c. 1975) to JavaScript that takes advantage of today’s personal computers and their graphical capabilities. This has been a labor of love. Chris worked at Bell Labs for 37 years. I knew Ken as an artist and contributor to a computer art exhibit I curated in 1980. Our intention is to “modernize” the code and use in today’s genre of Generative Art.\n\nIn Knowlton’s paper he gave a programmer’s description of MINI-EXPLOR as well as several example to test the described functions and routines. Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids was one of those examples. \n\nMINI-EXPLOR generated images for output on line printers and early CRT displays. It had a limited palette of 4 “characters” that consisted of configurations of alphanumeric characters, some over-struck, to produce a grayscale. In our representation we have replaced these alphanumeric character configurations with the concept of a “cell” consisting of 5x5 pixel blocks. For now, our picture space is in keeping with the original 140 character limit thus, the image size is 5 x 140 or 700 pixels in height and width.\n\nWe present to you the reincarnation of MINI-EXPLOR. We’ve kept the output as faithful as we could to Ken’s original test example. We’ve done three things to modernize the output for this NFT: 1) reformatted the output of the test example to use the full picture space. 2) replaced the original alphanumeric characters that made up a gray scale with blocks of 5x5 pixel “cells” and, 3) we’ve added color. Color EXPLOR images back in 1975 were produced using post-production techniques (printing inks or color gels). However, today full-color capabilities are an inherent part of the media and we use several algorithms to build gray-scale and RGB palettes limited to 4 colors as it was a restriction of the medium in the original design.\n\nWe honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history.",

            "description": "We have spent months looking for the anatomy of space. I think each of us have really been searching for it for decades. But  only recently have we decided to conjugate our efforts. \n\nThe arrangement of the features of a territory has been seen by many before us as something to be probed. The topographic endeavours of the explorers who have sliced the earth tried to make it finite. But even they know that they missed most of what was to be found. \n\nDaratan has started their explorations with pen and paper. Their pulaus are three-dimensional projections of units extracted from a planet that doesn’t exist. And yet these representations are immediately naturalised, for they evoke geographic norms which describe the world to those who wouldn’t see it for what it is. \n\nAnaglyphic took the opposite perspective, and set up abstraction generators that would enable others to create areas to be explored. The anaverse is a system which generates topographies according to simple rules which, called recursively, allow for unbounded diversity. Rather than observing space and trying to deduce what it is, they allow humans to build space and, in the process, prompt them to reflect on what they think it should be.\n\nThe temporary intersection of these individual journeys yielded pulau gen. In an attempt to demineralise both our media, we decided to populate the pulaus with guardian creatures. The whales, octopi and birds are as many reminders that a topographic representation is usually missing the one thing that matters the most about it: the life it can host. ",

Mixing etching, silk-screening, offset, photocopy, risography, drawing and painting to design and craft experimental art books.From the day digital, which had always fascinated me, took over my publishing practice, I always liked to create bridges between these two worlds.\n\nThe Living Books is part of this series of hybrid and experimental works where paper and digital resonate.\n\nThis issue #1 is made of 64 pages that will be minted by collectors. A book will eventually be printed and the pages will follow the mint order. Each page exists in a cover version (c) and a xerox version (x).\n\nControls :\n\n• Click to dive into each frame.\n• Press C to toggle cover mode.\n• Press X to toggle xerox mode.\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nThe Living Book #1 by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n",

I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same.

Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js.

I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions.

Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible.

So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js.

            "description": "AERO\n\nIn the stillness of the void, floating cities hang suspended, bound by no earthly gravity. The buildings, wrought in shades of dreamy pastels, appear as though they have been plucked from some other time and place, and set adrift in a new and unknowable realm.\n\nHere, amidst the stillness and silence, ropes hang loosely like vines, connecting the structures in a delicate web of possibility. The architecture of the buildings is vaguely familiar, yet strangely surreal, hinting at a past now forgotten.\n\nAs the eye wanders through this landscape of suspended structures, a feeling of nostalgia begins to seep in. There is a sense that these cities were once inhabited, bustling with the energy of human life. Now, they stand alone, abandoned and forgotten, as nature slowly reclaims its territory.\n\n\n\nThe AERO series explores how a minimalistic set of shapes and rules can be extrapolated to create complex assemblies, the same way individual buildings will form villages and cities.\n\nTo add a sense of organic texture to these geometric structures, ropes that connect certain squares have been added. They can sometimes take on the appearance of vines. This addition aims creates a sense of tension between the man-made and the natural.\n\n\n\nDouble click or double tap to save the current image\n\nIn fullscreen mode / live view:\nAdd \"&size=xxxx\" at the end of the url to generate a custom sized image\nAdd \"&clean\" at the end of the url to remove the grain effect\n\n\nArtist: Estienne\nFeb. 2023\nLicense: NFT 2.0",
