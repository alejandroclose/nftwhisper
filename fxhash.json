            "description": "Continuing on the theme of color perception in Farbteiler, Punktwelt is an exploration of color interaction, projection and perceived depth, and the aesthetics of simple Boolean operations on form.\n\nEach shape is the result of a single block, a rectangular cuboid, subjected to a series of Boolean subtractions with other blocks, and rendered in parallel projection, oblique or axonometric, in the abstract landscape of the Punktwelt.\n\nSome have horizons, some have banded or striped backgrounds. The unnatural drawing order and chromatic differences of the individual faces sometimes yields illusory or paradoxical visual geometries.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png. Press ’4’ to export a high resolution png. Press ’8’ to export a very high resolution png. Press ’e’ to export an SVG file (may take some time and produce large files).\n\nAspect ratio variations are 4:5, 5:4, 2:3, 3:2 and 1:1.\n\nBuilt in Javascript with p5.js, p5.svg and csg.js.",

            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements.

Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels.

The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it.

I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to.

The inspiration comes from both the superbloom in California this spring, and the carefree summer vacations of my childhood. I used to live close to a beautiful woodland in northern China, with a willow-lined creek filled with lotus and water lilies. I spent many long summer days playing in the woods with my friends, pretending to be explorers, detectives, martial arts masters, and more ... back then I only dreamed of the future, and now I sometimes dream of the past. Things as small as the taste of a hawthorn berry or the fragrance of a pagoda tree would pull my mind back to that simpler time. I can't remember the shape of the creek or the paths we took, yet the colors are still vivid as new, and they bring me a sense of happiness and peace. \n\nThe artwork is best viewed in full screen mode in a Chrome browser. \n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.09\n\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is based on the width of the browser window.\n[j] Save a JPEG image of the live view, default resolution is based on the width of the browser window.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 1.78 (16/9)]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1.33]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n&res=[output size of the long edge]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

            "description": "The Visible Manifestation of Invisible Forces\n\n“Fantasies of the past determined by needs of the present have a direct impact on realities of the future.” –– Svetlana Boym\n\n\nThis series continues my explorations into generative abstract expressionism, building on the techniques and approaches of my previous works “THE400FLIPS” and “a fortiori.” This time viewers can interact with the piece by adding more particles onto the canvas, effectively altering the behaviour set by the transaction hash —a collaboration between the artist, chance, and the collector. \n\nArt is fantastic and induces fantasies: This is one of those cases where the art is more than the thumbnail. I encourage you to run the code and interact with the canvas. As you alter the outputs, you will experience them as fleeting moments. Seen and gone, unless you are fast enough to catch them as we do with photographs: use the spacebar to pause the animation, then save a png image file by pressing “s”.\n\nConsider each reload and interaction a new simulation of life.\n\n\nThis work is, at its core, an implementation of Craig Reynolds’s Boids program to simulate the flocking behaviour of birds. As such, the flocking parts used in this work are released under the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nControls:\n[s] Save as PNG.\n[spacebar] or [x][z] Pause/Play.\n[Click and drag] Add more particles to the canvas.\n\n\nSoundtrack:\nI curated a Spotify soundtrack to accompany the work. Enjoy:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Nn2dM4cLqOukBDcryKk1d?si=cc48c678e6f34c2b\n\n\nNotes:\nCreated with p5.js and GLSL – optimised for Chrome – designed to be experienced on a desktop computer.\n\nThe preview capture module uses GPU instances.

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

            "description": "The first blueprint was found in 1947 on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.\nIt has been studied several times.\nNumerous theories arose trying to explain its origin.\nNone of them was decided conclusively.\n\nOne year ago, a rare group of waves coming from space was intercepted on earth.\nThis happened during the 2021 summer.\nIt was unclear if they were born from natural events.\nDying stars, black holes... Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n—--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n—--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n—--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022.
