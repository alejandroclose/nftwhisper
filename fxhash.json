Initial drawing with a placeholder color assignment algorithm\n2. Analysis and final color assignment\n3. Streamline tapering and conversion to SVG\n\nThe final step will typically cause the image to look darker than the previous steps due to the tapering of the streamlines and the vector nature of SVG. I recommend viewing Harmonium outputs on the largest screen you have available.\n\nThe final SVG version of the image can be exported by pressing the 'e' key.\n\n*Plotting*\n\nYou can disable/enable streamline tapering by pressing the 't' key. Un-tapered exports are intended for plotting on your favorite pen plotter, and include several Inkscape-compatible layer definitions to make plotting different colors possible. (Be sure to disable the background layer.)\n\nThe SVG has no dimensions defined so you will need to set the paper dimensions by adjusting the SVG as needed. I will provide additional detail on how to do this in an upcoming blog post. (The short version is to change the page dimensions in Inkscape and set the viewbox width and height to 1.0.)\n\njpalmer.dev\n@jeffpalmer",

            "description": "This generative art token was created as a collaboration between generative artist frederative and the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC. It began as a discussion about storytelling on the blockchain. What does it mean to be living through a pandemic while simultaneously experimenting with nascent technologies, both of which are radically disrupting our lives? The answer is [i.wonder] by frederative x NFTMuseumSC. \n\nWe share 33% of future royalties with the original minters in an effort to encourage the promotion of fxhash artists and raise awareness of generative art on the blockchain. We want this art to spread far and wide. Thank you for your support in helping us accomplish this goal.\n\nToken Details:\n\n[i.wonder]\nCollab by frederative x NFTMuseumSC\nMay 2022\nfxhash Compliant NFT\n\n\nArtist Bio:\n\nfrederative (real name redacted) is a generative artist from the snowy depths of the midwest (US).  He has been coding for many years but only recently discovered the joy of generative art.  Like many others, he was drawn into the field from watching TheCodingTrain and quickly fell off the deep end with artistic coding.  Bouncing between the worlds of procedural generation, glitch art, and particle motion, frederative’s work can best be described as “ok” and also “somewhat decent.”  At home, his spouse can constantly be seen shaking her head and saying “I can’t believe people pay money for this.”  His playful nature and sense of humor often leak into his art and biographical musings.\n\n\nArtist Statement\n\n[i.wonder] is an exploration of parenting and how historical events can impact parents and their children.  Our grandparents grew up during the Great Depression and lived through eras of war.  At times, commodities were scarce or unattainable and one had to ‘make do.’  Nothing could ever go to waste - everything had to be washed, reused, fixed, stitched up.  Their eccentricities now reflect those times, leaving their children to shake their heads at their extreme frugalness.  Consumer culture has eviscerated this ideal in current generations, yet they still continue on.\n\nAs a parent I wonder if the impacts of the Covid pandemic have imparted similar behaviors on myself.  Crowds cause me to hyperventilate and search for empty space.  My personal bubble has extended by several feet - any incursions and I become uncomfortable.  Bringing my kids out in public is a waking nightmare at times - any cough or fever now comes with the concern that it might not just be another kid cold.  \n\nOur lives have been changed and I really, really wonder if that’s something that has surreptitiously changed our parenting style.  When they’re grown up, will they think that our eccentricities stemming from Covid are annoying?  Cute - a relic of a bygone era?  Or just \n\nEmbedded text:\n\nI remember my grandparents being frugal.\nThey would use every part of an animal.\nThey would wash plastic bags to reuse.\nThey would never spend money frivolously.\nNothing would go to waste.\nI wonder what stories we'll tell our grandchildren.\nI wonder if they'll think we're crazy for avoiding crowds.\nI wonder if they'll understand the horror of other people.\nI wonder if they'll understand why we hold them tight.\nI wonder if an errant cough will make them panic.\nI wonder.\n\nInteractions:\n- Press 's' save hi-res\n\nAdditional Credits and Attributions:\n\nhttps://p5js.org/\nColor palettes derived from Chromotome: https://kgolid.github.io/chromotome-site/\nShadows: https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/drawingContext\nLinear gradient: https://p5js.org/examples/color-linear-gradient.html \nFloyd-Steinberg dithering (implementation based on: https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1192123)\nm5x7 font by Daniel Linssen: https://managore.itch.io/m5x7 \nPersonal use license only\n\n\nAbout the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC:\n\nEstablished in October of 2021, the mission of the Non-Fungible Token Museum is to provide a physical and virtual space for NFT art education, collaboration and exhibition in an effort to help our communities benefit from emerging blockchain technologies.

            "description": "\"What would an ocean be without a monster lurking in the dark? It would be like sleep without dreams.\" ‒ Werner Herzog\n\nMythological monsters like Leviathan, Tiamat, and Lotan have long inspired awe and fear in people’s hearts. I was inspired by these sublime monsters and wanted to evoke their haunting and otherworldly presence.\n\nFor this project, I used creative coding techniques to simulate the methods of monotype printmaking. This medium allows for a fluid and expressive approach to art-making perfectly suited for my vision of these mythological monsters. With this work, I’m bringing these ancient legends to life in a contemporary form, exploring their enduring power and beauty by combining modern techniques with one of the oldest forms of visual art. \n\nMy goal is to arouse a sense of wonder and mystery, using color and abstract shapes to conjure up visions of these legendary monsters from the abyss. Whether you see them as terrifying beasts or beautiful creatures of legend, one thing is clear - these monsters will always remain part of our collective imagination.\n\nFeatures:\n-6 Types of Monsters (Leviathan, Lotan, Tiamat, Aspidochelone, Hydra, Charybdis)\n-3 Frame Styles (Portrait, Landscape, Square)\n-10 Color Palettes\n-Hidden Jewels of the Sea",

            "description": "GuilCity is the beginning of an exciting journey bringing Guillaume Cornet’s densely-packed cities into the generative realm with the help of Matthew’s (@frostbitten’s) magic touch.\n\nMatthew—with his background in coding and animation—enables a new opportunity to experience these cities like never before. Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey! \n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you’ve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n—\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n—\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n• https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n—\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others’ skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci à tous!

You will find a menu in the lower-right corner which allows you to play with the iterations and camera position. You can also render high-resolution images here.\n\nA little bit of magic happens when you select low iteration values, perhaps your token will even default to this. \n\nTechnical:\n\nNot all browsers support multi-threaded modules, the fallback mode is quite slow.

            "description": "by Daeinc\nAug 2022\n\nDuet explores generative+computational motion and creates an almost infinite sequence of visual compositions. Two groups of shapes transform, merge, and split randomly. What can be disorienting starts to make sense as every element is animated from one to the other. This transition animation is what connects random pieces and creates a relationship between them. Each element is mathematically interpolated, with its motion defined by an equation. \n\nAlthough there are key moments, it is hard to summarize time-based work as a static image. As a constantly evolving generative motion piece, Duet invites viewers to form their impression by feeling the rhythm over time.\n\n## Guide:\n- The animation responds to window aspect ratio. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- For reliable playback, keep the window active and use IPFS view.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.5.1 with Chromium 104.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction\n- [n] to play a new random loop.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause.\n- [s] to save PNG. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [up] and [down] to change shape resolution.\n- [left] and [right] to change BPM. only works while looping. \n- [h] to toggle high DPI mode. off by default.\n- [p] to toggle pixel snapping. off by default.\n\n## URL Parameters\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&w=1200&h=600\n- [w] and [h]: set width and height in pixels. (ex. w=1200&h=600)\n- [s] and [e]: set starting and ending keyframes (inclusive) for loop. (ex. s=20&e=24) \n- setting large values for start/end is not advised.\n- [len]: instead of start/end, set a loop length between 1 and 16. (ex. len=4)\n- [bpm]: beats per minute. (ex. bpm=80)\n- [res]: shape resolution between 0 and 18. (ex. res=2)\n- [pr]: pixel ratio. set it to 2 (or press [h]) for hi-DPI screens.\n- [ar]: maximum aspect ratio. set to any value over 1. 1.2 by default.\n- [snap]: add the param to snap to pixel grid.\n\n## License\nCC BY-NC 4.0\nPlease refer to the included LICENSE.md for license information.\nLibraries used: canvas-sketch, canvas-sketch-util, dom-events, hsv2rgb, keyframes, equations from easings.net, array shuffle from stackoverflow.",

            "description": "\"Finestre\" means windows or apertures in Italian. This generative art project was inspired by the appreciation of collected memories, windows in time to our past experiences and loved ones. Using basic geometry such as rectangles, squares, circles, ellipses, triangles with random compositions and many possible color palettes, Finestre presents our impression of portals to the Universes of collected memories through abstract still code-based outputs.\n\nFinestre is a collaboration generative art project between generative artists Gonz0x and Schizzo.\n\nFinestre has some fun interactive features which allows collectors to view the work in different configurations. For example, collectors can isolate the deconstructed background layers, isolate the main constructed layer, add Grain and also enter a Free Play mode which allows for the option to draw background and foreground layers, stacking infinitely. You can Save off a render as a .png.\n\nPress \"C\" for Constructed Mode (Isolate Foreground)\nPress \"D\" for Deconstructed Mode (Isolate Background)\nPress \"R\" to reset to Default = C & D\nPress \"G\" to add grain texture with each press\nPress \"S\" saves render\n \nPress \"F\" to toggle Free Play mode\nIn Free Play, Press \"Q\" repeatedly to add Deconstructed layers\nIn Free Play, Press \"W\" repeatedly to add Constructed layers",
