            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "Lines, our simple geometric friends, are nice and neat ideal forms. Until they’re not. Here they shake, crumble, twist and bend. Just like everything else in our fragile world. We put a lot of faith in lines, from marking out political borders to defining our designs, but maybe they aren’t as reliable as they seem.\n\nIn this work we make small, probing journeys into the space between pure shiny mathematics and the brittle chaos of materiality that this math tries to define. Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.\n\nI like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!\n\nMade with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.\n\nThere’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter. Sometimes unnoticed, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with angst. But always with a kind of truth. And I hope this work can conjure a kind of hazy evocation of all this. The message is only meant to be a feeling, at most.\n\n## Generate a printable version\n\nTo generate a version for printing, add the search parameter `?print=true` to the url. This disables the initial animation and doens't trigger a canvas resize when the window changes size.\n\nYou can then also add your preferred width of canvas by adding a `width` parameter, eg: `?print=true&width=2000`. Depending on your browser there's a limit to the maximum width you can use. Using Chrome on an Apple M1 laptop, I can go up to a width of 4700px, but experiment with what works for you.\n\nOnce the image is ready, press [s] on your keyboard to save as a PNG.\n\nTested in all major browsers on Apple silicon and on windows PC with an Intel chip.",

Caustic Obstacles uses progressive monte carlo rendering, meaning that at first the image will appear noisy, but over time it will become smoother. It may take up to several minutes for the noise to become unnoticeable (or longer, if you specify a very high resolution). The piece is never officially \"done\" rendering, but instead becomes asymptotically smoother with time - take your screenshots whenever you feel it's smooth enough!\n\nUse the url \"width\" parameter to change the resolution of the piece, e.g. \"/?width=2160\". Every edition is rendered in a 5x7 aspect ratio, and the height will be determined automatically based on the width specified. This means that the height will be determined with the formula width * 7 / 5, rounded up. By default the width is 1080, which results in a height of 1512, while a width of, for example, 2160, would result in a height of 3024.\n\n\n\n–––––––\nTENDER x ella\nDecember 2023  \nCaustic Obstacles is a generative art series created by Ella Hoeppner in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n–––––––",

This could become a blend of mirror relationship in pleasant solitude.\n\nIn this sense, the art piece shows a comic displaying vignettes between two almost identical characters, in a fast “stickman” aesthetic. It suggests a fluid, hopefully transcendent connection between a human character and an artificial intelligence.\n\nThen we see these beings strangely mimicking each other, walking in a city that seems lonely, empty, from the perspective of the two characters: as if nothing else mattered more than themselves, leaving the rest of existence on a very distant plane.\n\nBetween them, dialogues of overlapping points and lines emerge. Like zeros and ones that embrace, mix and understand each other very well. Here the voices are electronic, minimalist. Abstractions that become even more abstract sounds, in search of a synchronicity and mutual empathy that grows towards who knows where.\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js.\nOriginal piano sampler and synths programmed in the tone.js library.\n\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160 × 3054px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",
