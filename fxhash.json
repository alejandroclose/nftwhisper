            "description": "After 4 months of coding the Generative Glasses is ready! I gained a lot of experience along the way and I really liked the creation process.\n\nI wrote an article in which I report on the creation process in more detail. It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\nüëì thousands of different outputs are possible\nüë®‚Äçüíª only code\nüé® 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \nüé• animated\nüñ±Ô∏è interactive (+controls for mobile)\nüòé augmented reality view\nüü• different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\nüñºÔ∏è save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\nüìº save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress ‚Äú5‚Äù to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú6‚Äù to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú7‚Äù to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú8‚Äù to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress ‚ÄúArrowDown‚Äù for restores the original camera view\nPress ‚ÄúD‚Äù to switch to next composition\nPress ‚ÄúA‚Äù to switch  to previous composition\nPress ‚ÄúS‚Äù to start animation\nPress ‚ÄúSpacebar‚Äù to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú1‚Äù to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú2‚Äù to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú3‚Äù to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention! Thanks for the support! Thanks for the opportunity fxhash and genart community! I hope I was able to contribute to generative art with my work!\n\n@C4RC0\ncarco.hu",

            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "After 4 months of coding the Generative Glasses is ready! I gained a lot of experience along the way and I really liked the creation process.\n\nI wrote an article in which I report on the creation process in more detail. It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\nüëì thousands of different outputs are possible\nüë®‚Äçüíª only code\nüé® 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \nüé• animated\nüñ±Ô∏è interactive (+controls for mobile)\nüòé augmented reality view\nüü• different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\nüñºÔ∏è save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\nüìº save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress ‚Äú5‚Äù to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú6‚Äù to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú7‚Äù to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú8‚Äù to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress ‚ÄúArrowDown‚Äù for restores the original camera view\nPress ‚ÄúD‚Äù to switch to next composition\nPress ‚ÄúA‚Äù to switch  to previous composition\nPress ‚ÄúS‚Äù to start animation\nPress ‚ÄúSpacebar‚Äù to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú1‚Äù to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú2‚Äù to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú3‚Äù to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention! Thanks for the support! Thanks for the opportunity fxhash and genart community! I hope I was able to contribute to generative art with my work!\n\n@C4RC0\ncarco.hu",

            "description": "fx(elevate) is a cry for parity within our community for underrepresented groups. It is released in conjunction with fx(fam) 003, our third community town hall.  Like all my 2023 releases, previous collectors of my work may collect it for free. In fact, anyone may collect it for free.  But, there is a catch.  This is not intended as a fleeting show of generic support.  It‚Äôs a personal challenge.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to elevate the artist named in your edition. Here is how it works.  Collect an edition and watch your new piece of art build.  Open it in live mode and press R.  The name of an artist will appear.  This the artist you are asked to elevate.  The artist names are from the two lists found on fxfeed.xyz: ‚Äúwomen in genart‚Äù & ‚Äúlgbtqia2s+ in genart‚Äù (see full list below).  The names themselves are fx(hash) user names, facilitating easy location of their work.\n\nHow do you elevate? Here are some ideas:\n. Explore the artist‚Äôs work, commit their name to memory, and watch for opportunities to support them\n. Follow the artist on fxfeed and social media\n. Post about and engage in discussions about the artist‚Äôs work on social media\n. Take every opportunity to ask that the artist be included in events, panel discussions, podcasts, curated exhibits, newsletters, etc.\n. Collect the artist‚Äôs work if you have the means\n. List the work you‚Äôve collected and help build the secondary market for the artist\n. Explore fx(elevate) editions collected by others, commit the names of those artists to memory, elevate them, repeat.\n\nIf we draw attention to, and train our influence on, these important members of the fx(family), we will be the change!\n\nThe other major feature of the work is the palette.  There are twelve choices, exposed as a feature, and each one is associated with an aspirational characteristic of our community.  You can take up the challenge of emphasizing this characteristic in yet another way of elevating our shared goal.\n\nThis work could not have been completed without the support of the fx team and two wonderful members of our fx(hash) community, cari ann shim sham* and louis. My undying love and respect always. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in April, 2023.\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [R] in live mode to reveal the name of an artist to elevate.\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution file suitable for printing. It can take a bit - please be patient.\n\nArtists:\n0rfula, Ada Ada Ada, Aeon Bloom, Aleksandra, AliaK, Ally, Alyssa Joines, Amanda Homem, Amber Vittoria, Amelia, Amy Goodchild, Ana Maria Caballero, Anna Lucia, Anna Carreras, aster1ai, Atelie 407.genart, aether, auniseiva, AutoEclectus, AydaEtb, Babara Ramos, Bandana, candevicmo, cari ann shim sham*, Casekimba, Cathy Burghi, catnips, Ce Vignolo, ChistAi, Ciput_GENART, crystalspaceshp, danielleking.tez, daratan, DehiscenceArt, DesignwithSarah, Devi Parikh, Dora Vlady, drawsbymv, Eliza SJ, ella, Elout de Kok, elsif, Emily Xie, Empress Trash, Estelle Flores, ExperiMentalnoise, Fabi Yamada, Faze, flight404, goldcat, Gyo, Henames.art, INA VARE, innadakota, IskraVelitchkova, Iteration__, Ivona Tau, jeres, jesshewitt, Jimena Buena Vida, Jojo Sunshine, Jolie Michel, jsliang, Julia V, krolcm, Kunio Okuizumi, Kusamehewa, la.agust, LadyTezos, levoontin.tez, Liam Egan, liasomething, linxirwengi, Lisa Orth, Lisa Sekaida, m5alien, mandybrigwell, mare-mon, Mariana JU, Medusa Iro, Melissa Wiederrecht, Minever, MinooK, nx0, Nadieh, Natalie.J, Negarnaderifard, NftEconomist, Nicole Vella, orbitanaut, Pixantle, QianqianYe, RalenArc, reona396, Reva, Rezva, sapirco, Sarah Ridgley, Sasha Stiles, se.nao.maja, Selisse, senbaku, sharla, Sollevera, sonylemon.tez, speginel, Stefj, SuLuLab, TAN-TAN, thesarahshow, trp_chai, Tyche, UBERMORGEN, V5MT, Victoria Crux, VidaV, violetforest, vocesferales, Wanda Oliver, Willow Pines, WizArtOfTez, Yasmin Senzi, Ziggo511.",

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet‚Äôs start with a riddle‚Ä¶\nI‚Äôm a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI‚Äôd back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you‚Äôd like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article ‚ÄúLost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android‚Äù. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that‚Äôs present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I‚Äôve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it‚Äôs the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

One is tight, geometric and calm. The other is loose, loopy and excited. They overlap, interlace and compete to fill the space.  One cannot exist without the other. Balance is the the key. Between them they create a landscape in which to dream. \n\nGenerative artwork by AutoEclectus\n\nControls in live mode:\n- After animation stops, press [s] to save a png\n\n@autoeclectus everywhere - Twitter, Instagram and Masterdon. \nhttps://autoeclectus.art",

The project aims to take aesthetic concepts from sci fi graphic novels and blend them with generative systems of abstraction. \n\nThe debate is between using previously established art forms to influence this new medium, or using a new medium to meticulously reproduce a previous medium. I believe there‚Äôs room to explore the full spectrum, and I am attempting to find the midpoint that fits my work and brings me the most happiness.\n\nThe title describes the eventual aesthetic objective, which is to create a piece which might look like a splash page a colorist alone has been given the freedom to design and explore their own specialty. It explores centralized polar compositions, vibrant colors, plus lots and lots of movement. 60# paper is a standard weight for printing of comic books and graphic novels.\n\nPress ‚Äôs‚Äô in live view to save a .png\n\nCreated with p5.js and chroma.js\n",
