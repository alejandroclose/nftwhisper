            "description": "Inspired and fascinated by Brutalism, Modernism and Bauhaus, I've started to explore the deeper connections of architecture using pixel art in a clean, minimalistic and unique way.\n\nThe BRUTALIST MOVEMENT project represents the next step in this process. It's an animated generative experiment that focuses on finding the simplest and fewest components that - when generated randomly - always create structures resembling buildings: from small modern houses through industrial facilities to gigantic brutalist monuments.\n\nThis resulted in 4 main components: Base, Extension, Gap and Window. These entities are used randomly to create Blocks that form the final structure. \nThe whole process is also strictly accompanied by 4 distinct components to hold colors and to be set by randomly chosen palettes: Sky, Sun, Shadow, Window.\n\nFeatures consist of a mixture of the above components.\n\nThe project is animated to show how the buildings come to life. It's also a nice way to show what's going on in the background, because from time to time a bigger block would surely hide interesting smaller ones :) \n\nPress these keys:\n's' - to download a larger resolution PNG\n'n' - to shuffle through the 'depth' of Blocks, aka placing them from front to back and vice versa. This is a nice feature to show structures hidden by others and also a cool way to create iterations inside the iteration - sub-iterations - we can say :)\n'r' - to reset the Blocks' depths to default\n\nPlease note:\nEverything you see is generated, animated and drawn real-time. No layered transparent PNGs, PFP or similar!\n\nHave fun and inspiration!\n\n\n@cloudnoise © 2022\n\n☁︎\n\nCreated with P5.js library.",

            "description": "“Sparsely Populated Grid” is the result of an architect’s fascination with Cartographies and a crypto-enthusiast love for Neo Punk aesthetics. The first sketch, drawn by hand with Procreate, was made in October 2021.\n\nThis is an exploration on the field of Generative Cartographies, an abstract diagrammatic representation of a randomly generated area within the virtual IPFS world. Everything starts with an GRID of varying sizes and angles, subsequently POPULATED by a random number of forms. But, how to populate the grid? SPARSELY, of course, with just the right amount of superpositions.\n\nThe algorithm produces varying compositions of fourteen different forms, with seven possible mixes and ten colour palettes. Movement, made possible by its generative digital nature, follows sinusoidal patterns, as if the forms breathed and danced to an unheard music.\n\nBesides, they never forget to celebrate birthdays.\n\n\n// INTERACTIVITY\n\n- CLICK or SPACEBAR to stop movement.\n- UP and DOWN ARROWS to Disable/Enable graphic elements such as texts (wink).\n- LEFT and RIGHT ARROWS (when stopped) to Move frames back and forth.\n- Press 1 for a low-res PNG.\n- Press 2 for a medium-res PNG (3x).\n- Press 3 for a hi-res PNG (6x).\n- Press G for Glitch (low-res).\n- Press P for PixelArt (low-res).\n\nIf you want a different resolution, you can also add ?&res=xxx to the url to get your desired output. Then simply Right-Click SAVE the canvas -- experimental",

            "description": "Mountains throughout human history have taken on deep meanings. Coated with immense sacredness by all peoples in the most different places. Being them as a representation of God himself or being the object of worship. For many the mountains were the very abode of the Gods. They are in the collective unconscious as the ability to connect men and gods, through the flow of energy between earth and heaven.\n\nThe symbology is very strong. It unconsciously reminds us of the process of encounter between the loneliness of the earth and the hope of the sky, between the fog that blinds and the cloud that supports, between the abyss of the ground and the proximity of the stars. All this is very charming and fascinating.\n\nAll human beings have their own mountain, which demands from each one their limits to reach the top, the desire for the breathtaking view, the fear of falling, but also the hope of the last step at the highest point.\n\nIn generative art it couldn't be different, going through all the learning, from its fundamentals, to all the countless hours of tests, to countless moments of problem solving and research and more research. This whole process is without a doubt like climbing a mountain. Thinking about the project is exactly like looking at a mountain and imagining how exhausting it will be all the way to conquer it. Finishing your work is like breathing a sigh of relief, looking down and seeing how hard it was to get there, but at the same time looking ahead and realizing how rewarding it was to be able to have that vision and breathe the refreshing breeze of the moment.\n\nAfter going through a transformation in my first work, where I transmuted my artistic essence from illustration to generative art. Now I come to this second work that I delved into, and after months of climbing this mountain of mine, I give it to you.\n\n\n- Press \"S\" in live view mode after loading to save at 1600x1600px.\n\nlicense: \nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nproject website:\nhttps://playman.me/projectmountain\n",

            "description": "\"Nature is the source of all true knowledge\".\n\nHave you ever taken the time to look, deeply look, at all the details in a humble patch of grass ?\n\nIn this tiny microcosm, a constant, fierce battle is going on, day after day, plants reaching out for sun, down for access to soil, fighting for survival. Smaller grasses form groups, alliances making it harder for taller ones to take over. Dead leaves remind us that some of them lost the fight, fallen warriors who, soon enough, will be forgotten too. Growth, decay, life, death, the endless cycle, right in front of our eyes.\n\nIt is fascinating, and, for me at least, an endless source of inspiration.\n\nIt is my hope that, through this project, you will take the time to take a closer look at nature, and that, as the pale blue dot we call home keeps getting drier and drier, remember that even humble patches of grass should not be taken for granted.\n\n\nKey commands:\n's' - save as png\n'b' - make the background transparent (for printing)\n'1', '2, '4' - set the pixel density, for resolutions up to 8000x8000\n\nThis updated version of the project should render on mobile devices, albeit with slightly reduced quality. \nIf you want to save the image for printing, I recommend you do so on desktop.\n",
