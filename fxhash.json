            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nSpending a lot of time with something/someone who is how you want them to be, often equalizes them by adopting the other's appearance. This could become a blend of mirror relationship in pleasant solitude.\n\nIn this sense, the art piece shows a comic displaying vignettes between two almost identical characters, in a fast “stickman” aesthetic. It suggests a fluid, hopefully transcendent connection between a human character and an artificial intelligence.\n\nThen we see these beings strangely mimicking each other, walking in a city that seems lonely, empty, from the perspective of the two characters: as if nothing else mattered more than themselves, leaving the rest of existence on a very distant plane.\n\nBetween them, dialogues of overlapping points and lines emerge. Like zeros and ones that embrace, mix and understand each other very well. Here the voices are electronic, minimalist. Abstractions that become even more abstract sounds, in search of a synchronicity and mutual empathy that grows towards who knows where.\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js.\nOriginal piano sampler and synths programmed in the tone.js library.\n\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160 × 3054px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "\n\"Polako\" means \"slowly\" in Montenegrin. When I first came here, the word I heard most often when I wanted to do something with someone or ask them for something was \"Polako.\" In the culture I grew up in, everything happened very quickly and was results-oriented. In my new city, it's the opposite. Things may move slowly, requiring patience, but the aim is for better results. Perhaps they're right; the longevity of quickly done things is debatable. Our contemporary culture is like that too, everything is based on consumption. Art fields are also affected by this trend. Many artists or works without a past become popular with instant attention and then disappear after a while. This is sad in the long run. But when artists who don't get the recognition they deserve face these situations, they question themselves and their art, feeling inadequate and unsuccessful. As someone who has experienced this a lot, I am a keen observer. But speed is not necessary. What's important is to be lasting. Yes, this is very difficult. It's really hard to endure life and make your production sustainable. I must be patient. I need to mature my ideas. Slower, more polako. Surely, our art will be appreciated. There is a hidden connection between slowness and faith.\n\nIn this collection, I have returned to my architectural world once again. I have designed new compositions for depth. I moved away from colors and focused on textures. I tried to draw attention to changing animations in the background and spontaneously formed pixel layouts in the foreground.\n\n*Start and stop animation: press 'Q'\n*Save image: press 'W' to save the current image as a PNG.\n*Fullscreen mode: press 'E'\n----------------------------------------------------------\nPolako © 2024 by NUBPLUS is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 ",

            "description": "\"Opposites are not contradictory but complementary.\" - Niels Bohr\n\nThe concept of yin and yang is an ancient philosophy about how opposing forces are not only complementary but actually give rise to each other. This idea reverberates through nature, art, and life itself. Now it is at the heart of modern physics. Perhaps this is a fundamental law of nature baked into the very fabric of existence.\n\nAntiflow is an exploration of how balanced complexity can arise from chaos by harnessing the dynamic interplay of opposing forces. To that end we were inspired to create this wildly unique set by mixing modern physics concepts with abstract expressionism and retro 3D primitives.\n\nThe aspect ratio is 3:2 to facilitate poster size prints and device wallpapers. Results are presented without borders, noise, or other effects to allow for maximum detail. Feel free to rotate in whatever direction you choose for the best display.\n\nPress \"S\" to save at a higher definition.",

This interactive minting project seeks to transform the traditional minting experience into something truly unique and unexpected.\n\nEach 'Portal' gives you access and 1x reserve for all future 'The Passage' experiences both virtual and IRL.\n\nFor more information, visit hereandnow.events or join the discord, and join us in redefining what it means to mint.\n\nSee LICENCE.md for license details.\n\nTECHNOLOGY :::::::::\n\nThis token is designed using a custom-built raymarching engine, built in a way that allows me to pass in chunks of GLSL code as determined by the params and features.\n\nThe geometry is generated using what's called a KIFS (Kaleidoscopic Iterated Function System) fractal, which involves taking the space, folding it, offsetting it, drawing in it, and repeating. By doing this, we can create some *very* complex appearing geometry using some relatively simple rules.\n\nFinally, this is an intense simulation and requires a somewhat powerful GPU to properly be enjoyed.\n\nCONTROLS :::::::::::\n\nMouse - Click and drag to move the camera around in the space.\nQ/E - Roll the camera.\nR/F - Change the speed of the camera.\nSPACE - Stop the camera from moving.\nO - Output a still picture without DOF.\nP - Output a still picture with DOF.\n\nURL PARAMS :::::::::\n\n&still=true\nThis will just render a still image.\n\n&dpr=X\nWhere X is a number. Will allow you to render the token to a higher or lower resolution\n\n&fullscreen=true\nAllows you to render the token at the screen resolution of your browser.\n\n&width=X &height=Y\nAllows you to set the specific dimensions of the token.\n\n&dof=true\nTurns fake depth of field on.\n\n&doflenngth=X\nChanges the length at with the DOF is calculated.\n\n&steps=X\nAllows you to explicitly set the number of steps the raymarcher can use.",

            "description": "Recently, while scrolling through my Twitter feed, I came across something about the bicubic interpolation method, which reminded me of a funny joke my professor once shared during a lecture on numerical methods:\n\n\"Bicubic interpolation is like ordering pizza from four different kitchens at once and then making them agree on the recipe. Each slice ends up exactly how you want it, but it takes way more effort than just eating plain bread 😄\".\n\nThis algorithm truly tries to account for all surrounding points to achieve the smoothest, most natural result — a real perfectionist in the world of interpolation! This mention inspired me to revisit bicubic interpolation, but this time from an artist's perspective.\n\nBicubic interpolation is a method for interpolating data points on a two-dimensional grid. It creates smoother surfaces compared to bilinear or nearest-neighbor interpolation. While bilinear interpolation considers only 4 pixels (2×2), bicubic interpolation takes into account 16 pixels (4×4), which is why it’s computationally more demanding. Here I fill the canvas pixel by pixel, using only the bicubic interpolation method to achieve smooth color gradients. A bit of chaos is introduced to the overall composition through my custom metric for pixel placement.\n\nPress S or double-click to save as PNG.\n\nKyiv, 11.2024.",

            "description": "My first project here is called <Breathing> (project #93). Unfortunately, I rushed its release without fully understanding how the fxhash platform works. I initially thought its main difference from competitors like hicetnunc or objkt was the ability to publish not static images, but programmatic code that generates a specified number of essentially identical images, differing only in aspects like randomized colors. This is why <Breathing> consists of 50 nearly identical copies of a single algorithm.\n\nTo make up for this, I’ve decided to gift collectors of <Breathing> a few new variations of the algorithm. The collection will feature 55 curated outputs personally selected by me. I’ve been meaning to do this for a long time, but kept postponing—life always has a way of adjusting our plans. \n\nThank you for your support! Wishing you a joyful and inspiring New Year!\n\n***\nProject idea: Movement reveals hidden opportunities.
