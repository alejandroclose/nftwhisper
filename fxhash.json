            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1.

            "description": "The title of the work is a paraphrase of René Magritte's famous work. In today's world, the irony embedded in it is wrapped up in a new way. How can we tell one from the other, such as natural from natural, if they look the same or perform the same functions?\nI was inspired to create branches by the news of the development of mechanical trees that can capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These cyborgs are able to do the job much more efficiently than their natural counterparts. Soon there will be an entire forest of mechanical plants in Arizona.\nThe mechanical trunks are tall columns, 1.5 metres in diameter, which are made up of discs, just like the stem of the mechanical-digital branch in this work. It is capable of twisting and taking a variety of forms, from entirely natural to more angular, industrial, mechanistic ones. Where does the fine line between our recognition of a living organism and an artificial one pass, does it exist and will it be important to us in the future?\n\nThe palettes are taken from Japanese prints celebrating the beauty of nature.\nPlus there is a vaporwave palette that reminds me of the game Metal Mutant, the aesthetics of which I was fascinated with as a child.\n\nMade with p5.js code\nTo save the image, press the 's' key. Enjoy!\n\nSeptember, 2022\nJulia V & YulikolaY",

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun.

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

            "description": "\"Herbarium\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022\n\nOccasionally, I stumble upon vintage scientific illustrations on various topics, exotically looking charts and graphs, alternative layouts for the periodic tables or psychological research diagrams, elaborate illustrations of botany and zoology, minerals, and natural and sometimes unnatural phenomena. Most of those illustrations are part of the \"art and science\" practices from the 18th and 19th centuries. At the core of those practices were observation and interpretation, unraveling complexity through visualizing abstract ideas or finding a creative approach for understanding previously incomprehensible forms. \n\nI'm an admirer of two female pioneers in the field. Maria Sibylla Merian created, with immense dedication, a book with intricate illustrations of plants and insects, later praised by scientists. On the other hand, Anna Atkins published a book with beautiful botanical cyanotypes, considered the first book with photographic images. These topics are the visual inspiration for pieces presented at ArtBasel HK. \n\nMy mathematical background makes me naturally attracted to graphs, converting numbers to curves, and everything schematically displayed. Also, combining scientific symbols and illustrations with imaginary data inspires the spectator to find meaning in unrelated or random things or provokes latent skepticism towards assumed concepts of truth, reality, and knowledge.

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",
