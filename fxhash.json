Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

OBSCVRVM, meaning ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales.

Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state ‚Äì heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space.

Also reminding us of the interconnectedness of our planet's ecosystems in order to motivate us to appreciate and protect our oceans.\nWhether displayed in homes, offices, or public spaces, Ocean Currents will add calm and natural beauty to any setting.
