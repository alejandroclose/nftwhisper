            "description": "If light, which is generally a wave, can also sometimes be a particle - then can matter also be a wave? Louis De Broglie suggested this idea, which is supported by performing a double slit experiment with matter particles and producing an interference pattern that indicates wave behaviour. Performing the experiment with one particle at a time also produces an interference pattern, implying the particles create interference with themselves. One way this could be possible is if the particle travels infinite potential paths simultaneously, super positioning itself in many places at once. If one electron can be in infinite places at once, is it possible that all electrons are that same one? More than thinking everything is connected, can we go one further and think that everything is the same thing? \n\n'Matter Waves' super positions connections between constellated nodes, spreading them out through space in multiple ways - an aesthetic exploration of these ideas. \n\n's' to save large file\n'1' to watch it load slowly \n'2' to watch it load super slowly\n\nFully live code in p5js\n\nwww.amygoodchild.com\n@amygoodchild",

The sense of regularity strengthens and we feel it swelling towards a singularity. Heeere weeee goooo… BAM! Then off again marching back into chaos to repeat the cycle.\n\nProposed by cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter in his 1979 book “Gödel, Escher, Bach”, and further developed in his 2007 book “I Am a Strange Loop”, “Strange Loops” are Hofstadter’s attempt at explaining the mechanisms that give rise to the sensation of “I” - through hierarchical, self-referential, and at times seemingly paradoxical feedback-loops of abstraction and causality. \n\n—\n\n“Who shoves whom around in the tangled megaganglion that is your brain, and who shoves whom around in ‘this teetering bulb of dread and dream’ that is mine?”\n\n“Do dreads and dreams, hopes and griefs, ideas and beliefs, interests and doubts, infatuations and envies, memories and ambitions, bouts of nostalgia and floods of empathy, flashes of guilt and sparks of genius, play any role in the world of physical objects? Do such pure abstractions have causal powers? Can they shove massive things around, or are they just impotent fictions?” \n\n\"In the end, we are self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages that are little miracles of self-reference. [...] Poised midway between the unvisualizable cosmic vastness of curved spacetime and the dubious, shadowy flickerings of charged quanta, we human beings, more like rainbows and mirages than like raindrops or boulders, are unpredictable self-writing poems — vague, metaphorical, ambiguous, and sometimes exceedingly beautiful.”\n\n- Douglas Hofstadter, “I Am a Strange Loop”, 2007\n\n–-\n\nMemo Akten \nƈօʍքʊtǟtɨօռǟʟ Aʀȶɨֆȶ; AI wrangler; curious philomath; PhD in Creative Artificial Intelligence with Meaningful Human Control; works with code to create images, sounds, films, large-scale responsive installations and performances; fascinated by trying to understand the nature of nature and the human condition.\n\nJames Paterson \nSynthesizing drawing, animation, sculpture and code under the moniker Presstube since 1999. Inspired by meditation, molecular biology, music, parenting, psychedelics, the seen, the heard, the felt, the cognized.\n\n–-\n\nControls:\n- CLICK/TAP ONCE ON THE SCREEN TO ACTIVATE SOUND\n- ‘S’: to toggle Sound on/off (only works when opened fullscreen)",

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

The sense of regularity strengthens and we feel it swelling towards a singularity. Heeere weeee goooo… BAM! Then off again marching back into chaos to repeat the cycle.\n\nProposed by cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter in his 1979 book “Gödel, Escher, Bach”, and further developed in his 2007 book “I Am a Strange Loop”, “Strange Loops” are Hofstadter’s attempt at explaining the mechanisms that give rise to the sensation of “I” - through hierarchical, self-referential, and at times seemingly paradoxical feedback-loops of abstraction and causality. \n\n—\n\n“Who shoves whom around in the tangled megaganglion that is your brain, and who shoves whom around in ‘this teetering bulb of dread and dream’ that is mine?”\n\n“Do dreads and dreams, hopes and griefs, ideas and beliefs, interests and doubts, infatuations and envies, memories and ambitions, bouts of nostalgia and floods of empathy, flashes of guilt and sparks of genius, play any role in the world of physical objects? Do such pure abstractions have causal powers? Can they shove massive things around, or are they just impotent fictions?” \n\n\"In the end, we are self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages that are little miracles of self-reference. [...] Poised midway between the unvisualizable cosmic vastness of curved spacetime and the dubious, shadowy flickerings of charged quanta, we human beings, more like rainbows and mirages than like raindrops or boulders, are unpredictable self-writing poems — vague, metaphorical, ambiguous, and sometimes exceedingly beautiful.”\n\n- Douglas Hofstadter, “I Am a Strange Loop”, 2007\n\n–-\n\nMemo Akten \nƈօʍքʊtǟtɨօռǟʟ Aʀȶɨֆȶ; AI wrangler; curious philomath; PhD in Creative Artificial Intelligence with Meaningful Human Control; works with code to create images, sounds, films, large-scale responsive installations and performances; fascinated by trying to understand the nature of nature and the human condition.\n\nJames Paterson \nSynthesizing drawing, animation, sculpture and code under the moniker Presstube since 1999. Inspired by meditation, molecular biology, music, parenting, psychedelics, the seen, the heard, the felt, the cognized.\n\n–-\n\nControls:\n- CLICK/TAP ONCE ON THE SCREEN TO ACTIVATE SOUND\n- ‘S’: to toggle Sound on/off (only works when opened fullscreen)",

            "description": "[ TAP/CLICK TO ACTIVATE SOUND ]\n\nA whiff of pattern begins to emerge. Out of disarray comes the familiar pulsation of an ordered signal. The sense of regularity strengthens and we feel it swelling towards a singularity. Heeere weeee goooo… BAM! Then off again marching back into chaos to repeat the cycle.\n\nProposed by cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter in his 1979 book “Gödel, Escher, Bach”, and further developed in his 2007 book “I Am a Strange Loop”, “Strange Loops” are Hofstadter’s attempt at explaining the mechanisms that give rise to the sensation of “I” - through hierarchical, self-referential, and at times seemingly paradoxical feedback-loops of abstraction and causality. \n\n—\n\n“Who shoves whom around in the tangled megaganglion that is your brain, and who shoves whom around in ‘this teetering bulb of dread and dream’ that is mine?”\n\n“Do dreads and dreams, hopes and griefs, ideas and beliefs, interests and doubts, infatuations and envies, memories and ambitions, bouts of nostalgia and floods of empathy, flashes of guilt and sparks of genius, play any role in the world of physical objects? Do such pure abstractions have causal powers? Can they shove massive things around, or are they just impotent fictions?” \n\n\"In the end, we are self-perceiving, self-inventing, locked-in mirages that are little miracles of self-reference. [...] Poised midway between the unvisualizable cosmic vastness of curved spacetime and the dubious, shadowy flickerings of charged quanta, we human beings, more like rainbows and mirages than like raindrops or boulders, are unpredictable self-writing poems — vague, metaphorical, ambiguous, and sometimes exceedingly beautiful.”\n\n- Douglas Hofstadter, “I Am a Strange Loop”, 2007\n\n–-\n\nMemo Akten \nƈօʍքʊtǟtɨօռǟʟ Aʀȶɨֆȶ; AI wrangler; curious philomath; PhD in Creative Artificial Intelligence with Meaningful Human Control; works with code to create images, sounds, films, large-scale responsive installations and performances; fascinated by trying to understand the nature of nature and the human condition.\n\nJames Paterson \nSynthesizing drawing, animation, sculpture and code under the moniker Presstube since 1999.

            "description": "A study of building and destroying. I built this. You may knock it over.\n\nHumans are both creators and destroyers. One of the earliest games children learn to play is building with blocks, then knocking them down. This simple activity is teaching kids about gravity, cause and effect, and imposing their will on the world around them. As children grow older, the gap between these opposing actions widens. The intention behind knocking things down becomes less innocent, and creators aren't as excited to see their work destroyed.\n\nIn 1915, the Russian avant-garde founded the abstract art movement known as Constructivism, rejecting everything except for the absolute purest aspects of form and material. This art was used in service of the Russian revolution and utilized heavily in its propaganda, intended to highlight the utilitarian nature of industrial progress. Mainly, building the new Russia. Its influence is lasting, and can be seen throughout art and design trends even today.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, footage of missiles and airstrikes decimating Ukrainian buildings permeated the media. Ukrainian lives, kitchens, windowsill gardens, and family photos tumbled to the ground. Like children's blocks. Things that took a lifetime to build were destroyed in seconds. \n\nKONSTRUKTS represents this duality in creation and destruction. Stacked children's blocks are rendered in the style of Constructivist designs like El Lissitzky's Proun series, and Alexander Rodchenko's posters. With a simple tap, blocks (or buildings) can be knocked to the ground.\n\n- Tap anywhere to reveal the KONSTRUKTS menu in the top left. Tap the menu for several options.\n- KONSTRUKTS can be exported as USDZ or GLTF models to be used in augmented reality or the metaverse.\n- Export a full resolution PNG image from the menu.\n- If you knocked over the blocks, you can reset them from the menu.\n\nKONSTRUKTS is built entirely with code, using Three.js, JavaScript, and GLSL.",
