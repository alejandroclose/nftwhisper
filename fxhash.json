Franke\n\nI first came across Franke’s ‘Ornamental Alphabets’ in his book 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘎𝘳𝘢𝘱𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘴 - 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘈𝘳𝘵, and was intrigued with the idea of using a simple letterform to explore different generative image processing techniques. \n\nI’ve used letters and writing in my work for a long time, both with letterpress printing and in my asemic poetry programs. With asemic writing, I generate unrecognizable letters to reference text, and here I use recognizable letterforms removed from their typical function as language signifiers. \n\nMy goal with this project was to build as much texture and layering as possible by warping and collaging the letters together in various ways.

            "description": "This project is part of a larger experiment that explores and celebrates the process of making generative art by progressively releasing iterations, working towards a final release on my main account (tz1RkYY3jr1ocuPdQqrRefr5FqoawKQsmBmD). The iterations will be titled ____ - Iteration 1, ____ - Iteration 2, etc. At this point, the number of iterations has not been determined, but more information will be provided as this experiment unfolds.\n\nThe final release will only be made available to those who have collected each iteration (using an allowlist), and will be released for free.\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

            "description": "Fêlure is a piece picturing our inner selves.\n\nFêlure means a crack in french. It can almost be pronounced as Failure. But not quite.\n\nIt started from a square, that was cracked into many fragments. From outside, it is still a square, stable, reliable. From inside, it is a mess, with many experiences, each one being unique, each one with its own specificity.\n\nEven though we relate to others, there is no definition of normal. No one looks the same. This is why the palettes are all generated and there can be an infinity of them. Some have more darkness than others. Some are warmer, some are cooler. Some are a mix of many things.\n\nOur experiences and our cracks shape us. Sometimes following a natural flow. Sometimes following specific rules. But always guiding us as a whole.\n\n----\n\nThe day I started working on this piece, I realized that I often show myself as chill, ready to give a hand, ready to listen to others. But who am I to help others when I'm not sure about who I am or even what I am?\n\nMaybe that's why I'm able to relate. Because I have my own experiences that cracked me. And built me. So even if I'm a mess, even if I'm not sure about where I'm going, let's share and try to find out together.\n\n----\n\n- The images are meant to be viewed in an horizontal full screen but will adapt to any format\n- Click on the image to restart the animation\n- Hit \"S\" key or long tap on mobile in the live view to trigger an export\n- Add &width=5000 to the live view URL to render the image at 5000 pixels wide\n\n----\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienPradetArt",

The work was based on Acropora intermedia. \n\nIt’s a day after the full moon when the corals spawn simultaneously.\n\n——\n\n“The Restoration Scheme” Series\nIt’s a virtual action extended from the coral restoration plan led by Delta Electronics Foundation from Taiwan, consisting of five generative corals. Each of them was based on five different species of coral as the theme.\nIf collectors mint virtual corals, Delta Electronics Foundation will drop coral seedlings collectively in the sea. \n\nThe project is powered by FAB DAO (Formosa Art Bank). The split will donate to the local organization from Taiwan dedicated to the coral restoration scheme.\n\n——\n\nAbout Delta \nClimate change is causing irreversible impacts. Coral reefs, known for their rich biodiversity and the capability to nourish a quarter of marine life, are at the forefront of the crisis. Also known as \"tropical rainforests\" in the sea, coral reefs have experienced five mass bleaching events in the past five years. Once global warming exceeds the 2˚C threshold, it's likely that 99% of coral reefs will die off worldwide.\n\nIn addition to launching a coral restoration initiative along the northeast coast of Taiwan, Delta Electronics Foundation collaborates with Asia University to host \"Earth Pulsing: Nurturing Life Exhibition\" and releases the first art NFT featuring coral restoration. Through these actions, we hope to evoke public awareness of ecological issues.

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. \nwww.tribute-hwf.com\n\n“One criterion for art involves the process used by the artist for shaping the work. In the special case of mathematically supported fine art, the artmaking process occurs in a mathematically defined operation that allows the generation and transformation of images, methods used for picture processing.” - Herbert W. Franke\n\nI first came across Franke’s ‘Ornamental Alphabets’ in his book 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘎𝘳𝘢𝘱𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘴 - 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘈𝘳𝘵, and was intrigued with the idea of using a simple letterform to explore different generative image processing techniques. \n\nI’ve used letters and writing in my work for a long time, both with letterpress printing and in my asemic poetry programs. With asemic writing, I generate unrecognizable letters to reference text, and here I use recognizable letterforms removed from their typical function as language signifiers. \n\nMy goal with this project was to build as much texture and layering as possible by warping and collaging the letters together in various ways. The font I’m using is a design I made years ago to supplement my wood type collection for printing. I really enjoyed being able to bring that part of my past work into my generative art practice. \n\nEach image is composed of the letters found in the hash for that piece, divided into either vowels or consonants. The program builds on a technique I’ve used before, where I generate an image to an off-screen canvas and then dive through the pixels to pull out the color and form I want to surface in the final image.\n\n25% of the primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke. These funds will be used by ZKM Karlsruhe to digitize Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any additional funds raised will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n- Press “R” to increase the pixel density and reload the image (this can be render intensive and will create a really large file suitable for printing)\n- Press “S” to save a copy\n\nMade with p5js\nArtist: Sarah Ridgley\nOctober, 2022",

The iterations will be titled ____ - Iteration 1, ____ - Iteration 2, etc. At this point, the number of iterations has not been determined, but more information will be provided as this experiment unfolds.\n\nThe final release will only be made available to those who have collected each iteration (using an allowlist), and will be released for free.\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

            "description": "In this work I tried to convey the idea of a landscape (many landscapes) with hills, trees, grass, bushes, skies and clouds. As is normal on fxhash I have accomplished all this by writing the code that generates the elements in a scene.\nWhile writing the code to obtain these landscapes I did not try to reproduce landscapes seen in reality or in photography, rather I followed from time to time ideas of landscapes that came to my mind as a sort of lucid dream. I hope I managed to convey this idea of a landscape that is halfway between reality and fantasy.\n\nLands and Clouds are rendered using a mix of simplex noise and FBM (Fractional Brownian Motion), trees are generated with recursive functions an placed using Poisson Disk Sampling distribution. The distribution density could be homogeneous (land heightmap drive the density) or biased to have more density towards the top, bottom, left or right of the land.\n\n\nDeveloped with p5.js using WEBGL renderer.\nRendering is faster with chrome browser.\n\n[1] to render at 1600x1600\n[2] to render at 2400x2400\n[3] to render at 3200x3200\n[s] to save a png at last rendered resolution.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\"LandPalette\": 20 colormaps\n\"TreePalette\": 20 colormaps\n\"Light\":  Morning, Evening, Night\n\"SkyColor\": Blue, Azure, Turquoise, Gray, VioletRed\n\"Haze\": True, False\n\"Rainbow\":  True, False\n\"Grayscale\": True, False\n\"TreeDensity\": Homogeneous, Top, Bottom, Left, Right\n\n\nCreated by Andrea Belloni, fxhash: anbello, twitter: @Waterflowing0.
