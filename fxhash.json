We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "Kintsugi is a philosophy, it's the concept of highlighting imperfections, visualizing patches and seams on the area to focus on, rather than focusing on missing details.\n\nThis art of precious scars is a technique used as a means of analyzing the idea of ​​loss through synthesis and restoration of the destroyed and a metaphor for the possibility of rebirth.\nRecovery from destructive events is possible through care and patching, not through hiding the damage, but by accepting a new state of the object or the whole life.\nThe world is a vase that is endlessly disassembled and sewn together again, continuing to bear traces of each event.\n\nNon-human entities helped us put these vases together. In the beginning, there were vague forms, these were the shards themselves, created in collaboration with Latent Diffusion. Over time, they have grown in detail, drawing their stories more clearly, thanks to Jax Diffusion.\n\nThe code that puts everything together was written by Yulikolay, for which he is greatly appreciated.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

A form that celebrates the continuity of digital variation while respecting a discrete approach to a digital whole.\n\nIt is a generative follow-up to the project CM.CollabWood, where the same parts were embedded in a real-time participatory architectural environment, where clusters of parts were placed by participants in real-time in collective design sessions to create tangible collective open forms.\n\n___________________________________________________\nControls:\n• 'P' pause/play animation\n• 'B' monochrome mode (wait a bit for recalculation)\n\nResize Canvas in live/open mode:\n(press once and wait for recalculation!)\n• 'DoubleClick' go Fullscreen\n• '1' square 1024x1024\n• '2' square 2048x2048\n• '3' square 3072x3072\n• '4' square 4096x4096 (might not work on all laptops)\n• '5' landscape 4000x3000\n• '6' portrait 3000x4000\n• '7' fullHD 1920x1080\n• '8' UHD 3840 x 2160\n• '9' square small(for sharing a gif on twitter) 512x512\n• '0' flex. adapt to current window size\n\nSave & Export in live/open mode:\n• 's' save a .png of in current resolution\n• 'g' save a seamless loop .gif in current resolution\n(press the key and wait for export, might take some time, consider with higher resolutions files get pretty big)\n\nSteps to save a gif/png :\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• resize canvas to your desired resolution (wait)\n• press s or g and wait for recalculation & download to finish\n• enjoy elasticity :)\n___________________________________________________\n\n\nThis token may not work on mobile(!), but it allows exporting .png and .gif (see controls) to enjoy elasticity on different displays or mobile.

In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",
