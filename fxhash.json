            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.

            "description": "A collaboration between leading British high-end audio brand KEF, generative artist hieroglyphica, and creative studio Parameta, Absorbed embodies the process of noise becoming high-fidelity sound through KEF’s Metamaterial Absorption Technology (MAT™). \n\nMAT™ makes the KEF sound what it is: absorbing unwanted distortion to deliver pure, accurate sound exactly as the artist intended. Inspired by this intricacy, Absorbed illustrates pseudorandom networks of patterns, slowly emerging and transforming into the maze-like form of MAT™. Clarity is revealed, noise is absorbed – high-fidelity is found.\n\nThe noise fields used in Absorbed are of two distinct types: conventional gradient noise and “sinusoidal” noise, an original algorithm developed for this series. The use of animation as artistic medium reflects the artists’ belief that no single frame can capture the full range of complexity found in the tension between sound and noise, and lets collectors observe for themselves this ever-shifting dialogue. A more extensive discussion of the algorithms used in Absorbed can be found in hieroglyphica’s companion article on fx(text).\n\n- spacebar will pause and resume the animation\n- s will save a still image of the current frame\n- technically minded collectors can consult the index.html file for info on how to render and save high-resolution images\n- use of hardware acceleration in Chrome may impact performance\n\nFounded by BBC engineer Raymond Cooke in 1961, KEF is a leading British innovator of high-end audio products including HiFi speakers, subwoofers, architectural speakers, wireless speaker-systems, and headphones.

            "description": "“Sparsely Populated Grid” is the result of an architect’s fascination with Cartographies and a crypto-enthusiast love for Neo Punk aesthetics. The first sketch, drawn by hand with Procreate, was made in October 2021.\n\nThis is an exploration on the field of Generative Cartographies, an abstract diagrammatic representation of a randomly generated area within the virtual IPFS world. Everything starts with an GRID of varying sizes and angles, subsequently POPULATED by a random number of forms. But, how to populate the grid? SPARSELY, of course, with just the right amount of superpositions.\n\nThe algorithm produces varying compositions of fourteen different forms, with seven possible mixes and ten colour palettes. Movement, made possible by its generative digital nature, follows sinusoidal patterns, as if the forms breathed and danced to an unheard music.\n\nBesides, they never forget to celebrate birthdays.\n\n\n// INTERACTIVITY\n\n- CLICK or SPACEBAR to stop movement.\n- UP and DOWN ARROWS to Disable/Enable graphic elements such as texts (wink).\n- LEFT and RIGHT ARROWS (when stopped) to Move frames back and forth.\n- Press 1 for a low-res PNG.\n- Press 2 for a medium-res PNG (3x).\n- Press 3 for a hi-res PNG (6x).\n- Press G for Glitch (low-res).\n- Press P for PixelArt (low-res).\n\nIf you want a different resolution, you can also add ?&res=xxx to the url to get your desired output. Then simply Right-Click SAVE the canvas -- experimental",

            "description": "This project is the culmination of many generative art experiments I have run throughout 2022. It relies heavily on the random walks through color and space techniques I have been working with, but also introduces other elements related to 2D and 3D rotation, framing and grains.\n\nContinuum began as an abstract composition made up of a set of interacting elements against a background. This is still true. However, in my own mind, I have come to consider many Continuum pieces as peculiar, stylized observations of massive futuristic spacial, or quantum, constructions. Maybe even involving a wormhole through the fabric of space-time for some civilization well past 1 on the Kardashev scale. At the center is an erratic crystalline form, which is fed by power trains, and all around is a massive multicolored rotating containment structure.\n\nAside from the standard, inverse, threshold and washed types, the most defining trait of each composition is the “Back Style” which relates to a point of construction, activity or deconstruction of these structures. This is further refined by the panel style, the panel density and the rotation level. The other traits largely relate to color variability and aesthetics. \n\nThis work has been coded using p5.js, and half of all royalties from the primary, and secondary, sales are assigned to the processing foundation.\n\nPress s to download a 2400x2400 pixel image.\n\nThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.\n",
