And while we devise systems for solving unfathomably complex problems, generating algorithmic creativity, and unlocking regenerative biological possibilities, we simultaneously cling to the power and originality of emotional feeling – believing it to be the irreplaceable source of what makes us human.\n\nIf the body is our shell for emotion and soul, can an artificial humanoid be another vessel for these thoughts and feelings – for human essence itself? If our ‘soul’ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable? That we may see answers to these questions looks more real every year, and is perhaps a little frightening. \n\nEmotional Shell uses introspective portraits of future selves to question what it means to be human, when the people around us are no longer human.\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 1-3 to select from low, medium, and high quality settings\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2400px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nTENDER x wwatkns\nAugust 2022",

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "All of our strong emotions, feelings and experiences come from childhood. Sincere happiness or frightening cruelty is primarily inherent in children, so they learn about the world. When we were children, we first hurt someone, first burst into tears from resentment, learned what is good and what is bad. \nOur parents did not answer our questions, either because they did not know the answer or because they thought we were too young. We learned to look for the answers ourselves. Whoever says that children don't understand is a fool. They do understand, but they do it in their own way. The world as seen through the eyes of a child is not like the world as seen through the eyes of an adult. It is often not built on the laws of physics or the laws of the marketplace. In a child's world or universe, the moon is just a little light in the sky, and the next street is already a different country. Their world is built on speculation and magical theories. Unfortunately, a child's world is not eternal. As they grow up, the \"real\" life, the life of adults, pokes into them like a sharp needle over and over again. \nThere is something incredibly tragic about this time gap between child and adult. It is this period that I wanted to trace in my work. As teenagers, it is as if we are between two trains, we are no longer children, but we are not yet adults. We get to know ourselves, we test our strength and readiness to exist in the \"real\" world. We are trying to find our place in the unfriendly world of adults, but we are also not ready to let go of the magic of childhood. It confuses, torments, and frustrates us. But it is a necessary and unavoidable tragedy. \n\nCode by PureSpider",

            "description": "# Los Osos 2422\n\nI was working on the next EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "All of our strong emotions, feelings and experiences come from childhood. Sincere happiness or frightening cruelty is primarily inherent in children, so they learn about the world. When we were children, we first hurt someone, first burst into tears from resentment, learned what is good and what is bad. \nOur parents did not answer our questions, either because they did not know the answer or because they thought we were too young. We learned to look for the answers ourselves. Whoever says that children don't understand is a fool. They do understand, but they do it in their own way. The world as seen through the eyes of a child is not like the world as seen through the eyes of an adult. It is often not built on the laws of physics or the laws of the marketplace. In a child's world or universe, the moon is just a little light in the sky, and the next street is already a different country. Their world is built on speculation and magical theories. Unfortunately, a child's world is not eternal. As they grow up, the \"real\" life, the life of adults, pokes into them like a sharp needle over and over again. \nThere is something incredibly tragic about this time gap between child and adult. It is this period that I wanted to trace in my work. As teenagers, it is as if we are between two trains, we are no longer children, but we are not yet adults. We get to know ourselves, we test our strength and readiness to exist in the \"real\" world. We are trying to find our place in the unfriendly world of adults, but we are also not ready to let go of the magic of childhood. It confuses, torments, and frustrates us. But it is a necessary and unavoidable tragedy. \n\nCode by PureSpider",

            "description": "# Los Osos 2422\n\nI was working on the next EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "BRIDGE is a collaborative project for fx(hash), conceived by Camille Roux. The project was announced on Twitter on Feb. 7, 2022 [1]. Artists were given two weeks to contribute code that would draw tiles representing a bridge, in their own style. Artists were free to implement their own artistic vision, subject to one simple constraint: Respect the coordinates of the tiles for each iteration of the art. \n\nEach iteration has a default style determined randomly at mint. This style is named in the features and displayed in the thumbnail. However, each iteration includes all styles, and you can cycle through them by clicking on or touching the image. Styles will be shown in the order in which they are listed under INCLUDED STYLES.\n\nPress \"s\" to save a screenshot.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nI'm Camille Roux. I planned to do a lot of collab this year with fx(hash) artists I like, but it takes too much time, or maybe I like too many artists :) Some days ago, I woke up with this idea in mind: \"Hey! What if I make a collaboration with all the artists I like at once!\" This is how the BRIDGE project was born.\n\nMoreover, I love the mutual aid and solidarity between fx(hash) generative artists. The BRIDGE can be seen as a symbol of the link between us ♥️.\n\nThe project has also served as an inspiration for participants to extend and develop their coding skills outside their usual areas of interest. The code for the entire project remains available on GitHub [2].\n\nTHE INCLUDED STYLES\n\nText-to-Bridge (TTB) by Ada Ada Ada\nhttps://twitter.com/ada_ada_ada_art\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ada%20Ada%20Ada\n\nBlest Path by Anaglyphic\nhttps://twitter.com/anaglyph_ic\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/anaglyphic\n\nThe Old Woody Dock by Aqw_Zert\nhttps://twitter.com/Aqw_Zert\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Aqw_Zert\n\nBridge-Tunnel by Laurent Houdard\nhttps://twitter.com/CablesAndPixels\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Laurent%20Houdard\n\nEvaporating by Camille Roux\nhttps://twitter.com/camillerouxart\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Camille%20Roux\n\nBuildings by Camille Roux\nhttps://twitter.com/camillerouxart\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Camille%20Roux\n\nTGH Bridge by David Esq\nhttps://twitter.com/emcyze\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/David%20Esq\n\nCitadel by devnull\nhttps://twitter.com/lostpunks\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/devnull\n\nEinstein–Rosen by Elsif\nhttps://twitter.com/ElsifThen\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/elsif\n\nPath through the city by Estienne\nhttps://twitter.com/Estienne_ca\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Estienne\n\nstarry night//glitchy night by frederative\nhttps://twitter.com/frederative\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/frederative\n\nBlackboard by Generative Pen\nhttps://twitter.com/GenerativePen\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Generative%20Pen\n\nMozaik by Gorik\nhttps://twitter.com/gorikfr\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Gorik\n\nDevour by grosgg\nhttps://twitter.com/rosgg\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/grosgg\n\nburning bridges by jeres\nhttps://twitter.com/heyjeres\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/jeres\n\nSpace Disco Dancefloor by Julien Labat\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienLabat\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/julabat\n\n/nt/r/t///a/ by lunarean\nhttps://twitter.com/lunarean\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/lunarean\n\nNara by Makio64\nhttps://twitter.com/makio64\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Makio64\n\nBifrost by mandyBrigwell\nhttps://twitter.com/mandybrigwell\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/mandybrigwell\n\nRain under the stars by Matt Circles\nhttps://twitter.com/matt_circles\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Matt%20Circles\n\nEsoteric Oasis by Nick Dima\nhttps://twitter.com/nickdima\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Nick%20Dima\n\nStreet Lights by phil_osophie\nhttps://twitter.com/phil_osophie\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/phil_osophie\n\nRise by Robin Metcalfe\nhttps://twitter.com/solarise_webdev\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Robin\n\nFlower Bridge by RVig\nhttps://twitter.com/rvig_art\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/rvig\n\nhere comes the sun by shuhblam\nhttps://twitter.com/shuhblam\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/shuhblam\n\nInto another world by Claus O.

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
