Samuel's hands were weathered from years of meticulously shaping stones into sturdy structures. His reputation as the village's finest mason was well-deserved, for every building he touched seemed to possess a touch of magic. One sunny morning, the village elders approached Samuel with a special request. They sought to erect a grand wall in the village square, a symbol of unity and prosperity. Samuel gladly accepted the challenge, and over the course of many months, he worked tirelessly, selecting the perfect stones, carving intricate designs, and patiently assembling the wall piece by piece.\n\nAs the day of the wall's unveiling arrived, the entire village gathered in anticipation. Samuel had indeed worked a masterpiece. The villagers marvelled at the wall's beauty and craftsmanship, and they knew that it would stand for generations, a testament to Samuel's unparalleled skill and the enduring power of masonry to transform raw stone into timeless works of art and utility. Samuel's legacy as the village's master mason was secured, and his story would be told and retold, passing on the art of masonry to the next generation.\n\n_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|_\n___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___\n\n[h] generate high res version\n[s] save image\n\n_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|_\n___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___",

Samuel's hands were weathered from years of meticulously shaping stones into sturdy structures. His reputation as the village's finest mason was well-deserved, for every building he touched seemed to possess a touch of magic. One sunny morning, the village elders approached Samuel with a special request. They sought to erect a grand wall in the village square, a symbol of unity and prosperity. Samuel gladly accepted the challenge, and over the course of many months, he worked tirelessly, selecting the perfect stones, carving intricate designs, and patiently assembling the wall piece by piece.\n\nAs the day of the wall's unveiling arrived, the entire village gathered in anticipation. Samuel had indeed worked a masterpiece. The villagers marvelled at the wall's beauty and craftsmanship, and they knew that it would stand for generations, a testament to Samuel's unparalleled skill and the enduring power of masonry to transform raw stone into timeless works of art and utility. Samuel's legacy as the village's master mason was secured, and his story would be told and retold, passing on the art of masonry to the next generation.\n\n_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|_\n___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___\n\n[h] generate high res version\n[s] save image\n\n_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|_\n___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___",

            "description": "*WTBS.TXT* is the first collaboration between Thomas Noya and the Waiting To Be Signed podcast crew. Using the first year of episodes as training data, Thomas trained a GPT-2 model to generate text strings from seed words, phrases, or at random; over 3000 strings were curated from the model over several months. The strings are then randomly selected from the curated set and displayed in various fonts and patterns, evoking a retro-PC style inspired by 90s net.art.\n\nAn advantage of using so little data to train a model (yes, a year of content is nothing in AI terms) is that it allows the model to run wild and create funny and fantastical diversions. We used an AI service to transcribe the episodes, which introduced many spelling variations around fx(hash)-specific terms and artist names. All of this adds up to something that we are collectively excited to share with you.\n\nFrom WTBS: A year went by fast... so fast that we fully missed doing anything to celebrate. Please think of this token as a belated celebration of the first year of Waiting To Be Signed. This project could not be possible without the hours of content we produce each week. If you have enjoyed the show, we hope you will enjoy this as well. Please collect to support the continued creation of WTBS. Collect because you are a fan (of Thomas, us or both). Collect because it is a really cool project. Huge thanks to Thomas for volunteering his time to work with us on this, and thank you to everyone who listened and supported us as we move into our second year of the show.\n\n\nControls:\n[s] save as PNG\n\n\nWTBS ⫸ GPT-2 ⫸ p5.js ⫸ Blockchain\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2023 Thomas Noya and Waiting to be Signed\n\n◉_◉",

            "description": "Quantum ATLAS\n\nThis artwork was inspired by high-energy physics — the branch of physics that deals with the study of the fundamental particles and forces that make up the universe. It seeks to understand the structure and behavior of matter at the smallest scales, exploring the most fundamental building blocks of nature and the interactions between them.\n\nHigh-energy physics investigates fundamental particles, such as quarks, leptons, and bosons, which are the building blocks of atoms and matter as we know it. It aims to answer questions about their properties, masses, charges, and the forces that govern their interactions. This field of study relies on powerful particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider, to create high-energy collisions between particles and observe the resulting reactions.\n\nDetectors play a crucial role in high-energy physics experiments. They are sophisticated instruments designed to detect, measure, and analyze the particles and their properties that are produced during high-energy collisions in particle accelerators. Detectors enable scientists to collect data and gain insights into the fundamental particles and forces that govern the universe\n\nThe ATLAS detector is a large particle detector, one of the four main detectors at the Large Hadron Collider. ATLAS stands for \"A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS\" and is designed to investigate various aspects of particle physics, including the search for new particles, the study of the Higgs boson, and the exploration of fundamental forces and particles. The detector is massive in size, measuring about 46 meters in length and 25 meters in height.\n\nBy analyzing the vast amount of data produced by the collisions, scientists can gain insights into the fundamental nature of matter, unravel the mysteries of the universe, and potentially make groundbreaking discoveries that contribute to our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.\n\nQuantum ATLAS is my artistic endeavor that seeks to emulate the infinite variety of forms that elementary particles can exhibit during collisions within detectors. From elegant spirals and swirling vortexes to branching networks and pulsating clusters, it unveils a visual tapestry of shapes and structures that echo the fundamental processes occurring at the quantum level. The intricate lines in the artwork simulate the paths of particles as they traverse the detector, leaving behind traces of their presence.\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience. Chrome is highly recommended for high res saving.\n\nMade with love, math, physics, and p5js.\n\n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG  1880 x 1280\n[2] - save PNG 3760 x 2560\n[3] - save PNG 7520 x 5120\n[4] - save PNG 15040 x 10240\n\nOn mobile:\n[quick tap] - save PNG",

Samuel's hands were weathered from years of meticulously shaping stones into sturdy structures. His reputation as the village's finest mason was well-deserved, for every building he touched seemed to possess a touch of magic. One sunny morning, the village elders approached Samuel with a special request. They sought to erect a grand wall in the village square, a symbol of unity and prosperity. Samuel gladly accepted the challenge, and over the course of many months, he worked tirelessly, selecting the perfect stones, carving intricate designs, and patiently assembling the wall piece by piece.\n\nAs the day of the wall's unveiling arrived, the entire village gathered in anticipation. Samuel had indeed worked a masterpiece. The villagers marvelled at the wall's beauty and craftsmanship, and they knew that it would stand for generations, a testament to Samuel's unparalleled skill and the enduring power of masonry to transform raw stone into timeless works of art and utility. Samuel's legacy as the village's master mason was secured, and his story would be told and retold, passing on the art of masonry to the next generation.\n\n_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|_\n___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___\n\n[h] generate high res version\n[s] save image\n\n_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|_\n___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___",

Samuel's hands were weathered from years of meticulously shaping stones into sturdy structures. His reputation as the village's finest mason was well-deserved, for every building he touched seemed to possess a touch of magic. One sunny morning, the village elders approached Samuel with a special request. They sought to erect a grand wall in the village square, a symbol of unity and prosperity. Samuel gladly accepted the challenge, and over the course of many months, he worked tirelessly, selecting the perfect stones, carving intricate designs, and patiently assembling the wall piece by piece.\n\nAs the day of the wall's unveiling arrived, the entire village gathered in anticipation. Samuel had indeed worked a masterpiece. The villagers marvelled at the wall's beauty and craftsmanship, and they knew that it would stand for generations, a testament to Samuel's unparalleled skill and the enduring power of masonry to transform raw stone into timeless works of art and utility. Samuel's legacy as the village's master mason was secured, and his story would be told and retold, passing on the art of masonry to the next generation.\n\n_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|_\n___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___\n\n[h] generate high res version\n[s] save image\n\n_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|_\n___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___",

            "description": "\"the Pazyryk\"\n\"In the years 1326 to 1328 of the Solar Hijri calendar (equivalent to 1947–1949 AD), during a time when the Pazyryk carpet, the world's oldest known carpet, was discovered by Sergei Rudenko, a Russian archaeologist, in the Pazyryk Valley. This woolen carpet, adorned with vibrant colors, depicts images of horse riders, grazing deer, and mythical creatures.\n\nIn 'the Pazyryk' collection, inspired by the Pazyryk carpet and the exquisite artistry of carpets and kilims from the eastern regions, an exceptional display of the essence of color in abstract art has emerged. This collection has transformed into a comprehensive exhibition of timeless historical and artistic endeavors, offering viewers an innovative and profound experience through a wide spectrum of colors and artistic creativity.\n\nThe Pazyryk collection has been meticulously designed using 153 different color palettes and three distinct sizes with high resolution suitable for printing. This collection aims to present the colors, essence, and art of the eastern regions to the audience. Each color palette acts as a testimony to the amalgamation of emotions and insights of prominent artists throughout art history. Every color palette has been meticulously derived from the works of these famous artists, representing a fusion of interpretation and personal perspective. These palettes convey an abstract representation of artistic and technological trends, where color and coding techniques blend harmoniously.\n\nBy merging historical art with contemporary innovations, The Pazyryk reflects a living connection between the history of art and contemporary artistic currents. In this piece, I have endeavored to provide the audience with an abstract bridge for a deeper understanding of new art and creativity. Just as sunlight rapidly and captivatingly reflects off stained glass windows of eastern palaces, spreading a unique tapestry of light and shadow on the walls and floors, The Pazyryk conveys a distinctive experience of art and history through the rare abstraction of color and light. Each color palette simultaneously encapsulates a visualization of history and contemporary reflections, inviting us to a mesmerizing celebration of colors and forms.\n\n-\"To propagate the essence of My wonderful community, 50% of the royalty from each secondary sale will be attributed to minters.\"\n\nNOTE: \"This code follows a complex algorithm for its creation, so you may need to wait a bit for each result to load.

I often imagined it in the backyard at the time.\nIf I grow up and have my own house later, I want to live in a house with a backyard with a dense nature and a view of a vast mountain.\nAlthough I haven't achieved the imagination that I did when I was young yet. I'm so happy because I think it came true in the world of generative art.\nI hope you have the backyard that you imagine.\n\n--\n\nFeatures:\n - Canvas: vertical / horizontal\n - Palette: black / red / green / purple / yellow / blue\n - Highlighted object: tree / flowers / brickwall\n - MountainType: standard / sharp\n - Tree: true / false\n - Flowers: true / false\n - Stars: true / false\n - Fog: true / false\n - Brickwall: true / false\n - Sun or Moon: true / false / supersize\n - After the rain: true / false\n\n--\n\nPress \"s\" in live mode to download the rendered image as a png file.
