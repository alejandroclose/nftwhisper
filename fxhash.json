            "description": "Lines, our simple geometric friends, are nice and neat ideal forms. Until they’re not. Here they shake, crumble, twist and bend. Just like everything else in our fragile world. We put a lot of faith in lines, from marking out political borders to defining our designs, but maybe they aren’t as reliable as they seem.\n\nIn this work we make small, probing journeys into the space between pure shiny mathematics and the brittle chaos of materiality that this math tries to define. Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.\n\nI like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!\n\nMade with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.\n\nThere’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter. Sometimes unnoticed, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with angst. But always with a kind of truth. And I hope this work can conjure a kind of hazy evocation of all this. The message is only meant to be a feeling, at most.\n\n## Generate a printable version\n\nTo generate a version for printing, add the search parameter `?print=true` to the url. This disables the initial animation and doens't trigger a canvas resize when the window changes size.\n\nYou can then also add your preferred width of canvas by adding a `width` parameter, eg: `?print=true&width=2000`. Depending on your browser there's a limit to the maximum width you can use. Using Chrome on an Apple M1 laptop, I can go up to a width of 4700px, but experiment with what works for you.\n\nOnce the image is ready, press [s] on your keyboard to save as a PNG.\n\nTested in all major browsers on Apple silicon and on windows PC with an Intel chip.",

There are 17 figures that get combined and mixed over three layers. The figures vary in complexity but are generally created with vertical and horizontal lines only. Figures have at least one seed, some even have a seed per path. A seed is an oscillating pixel that can be compared to a square wave oscillator of audio synthesis and is usually followed by a path or a set of paths. The purpose of the paths is to send the pixels along the lines to make the figures visible through movement and to create a reduction to pure animation.\n\n👽 Kim Asendorf",

            "description": "Tr4ns4ctions is a series of real-time animations that use pixels to create an abstraction of the movement of values. The pixels are constantly rearranging, being transferred from offer to taker, liquify, appear and disappear. They are forming endless compositions, sometimes intransparent or with strange spins.\n\nThe level of abstraction has been set to a 2x pixel size and the color palette of the NES with 12 different color modes. 16 pixel patterns serve as the fundamental building blocks and a simplex noise field determines the direction of movement.\n\nclick || space => pause/unpause\n\nView all tr4ns4ctions at https://tr4ns4ctions.com\n\nKim Asendorf, 2022",

            "description": "Action; system is an experimental study inspired by the work of François Morellet. Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch A starts very simple. It's the basic grid framework I intend to use for the series. It's just a simple grid with one colored square (usually). Colors are borrowed from Echos/Orbits. Grid size, padding, and line thickness vary.",

It involves creating intricate and vibrant designs using bubbles as generative art.\nThe process begins by mixing a special solution that creates long-lasting and colorful bubbles. I carefully blew these bubbles onto the canvas and let them float and move freely. As the bubbles interact with each other, they create stunning patterns and shapes.\nI manipulated the direction, colors, and movement of the bubbles using live patterns and directed them across the canvas to create dynamic compositions.\nWhen the bubbles merge, they leave a vibrant trail, creating unique textures and patterns on the canvas. The result is a captivating work of art that comes alive with its own fluidity and movement.\nDancing bubbles are visually appealing, but they also evoke joy and playfulness. It captures the fleeting nature of bubbles and reminds us to appreciate beautiful moments that are fleeting yet magical.\nThis art form can be enjoyed in various settings, including galleries, exhibitions, or even live performances in aquariums decorated with colored lights. It's a delightful experience for me and viewers alike, as we watch the creation of ephemeral catches of bubbles that dance before our eyes.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",
