            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

            "description": "by Daeinc\nAug 2022\n\nDuet explores generative+computational motion and creates an almost infinite sequence of visual compositions. Two groups of shapes transform, merge, and split randomly. What can be disorienting starts to make sense as every element is animated from one to the other. This transition animation is what connects random pieces and creates a relationship between them. Each element is mathematically interpolated, with its motion defined by an equation. \n\nAlthough there are key moments, it is hard to summarize time-based work as a static image. As a constantly evolving generative motion piece, Duet invites viewers to form their impression by feeling the rhythm over time.\n\n## Guide:\n- The animation responds to window aspect ratio. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- For reliable playback, keep the window active and use IPFS view.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.5.1 with Chromium 104.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction\n- [n] to play a new random loop.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause.\n- [s] to save PNG. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [up] and [down] to change shape resolution.\n- [left] and [right] to change BPM. only works while looping. \n- [h] to toggle high DPI mode. off by default.\n- [p] to toggle pixel snapping. off by default.\n\n## URL Parameters\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&w=1200&h=600\n- [w] and [h]: set width and height in pixels. (ex. w=1200&h=600)\n- [s] and [e]: set starting and ending keyframes (inclusive) for loop. (ex. s=20&e=24) \n- setting large values for start/end is not advised.\n- [len]: instead of start/end, set a loop length between 1 and 16. (ex. len=4)\n- [bpm]: beats per minute. (ex. bpm=80)\n- [res]: shape resolution between 0 and 18. (ex. res=2)\n- [pr]: pixel ratio. set it to 2 (or press [h]) for hi-DPI screens.\n- [ar]: maximum aspect ratio. set to any value over 1. 1.2 by default.\n- [snap]: add the param to snap to pixel grid.\n\n## License\nCC BY-NC 4.0\nPlease refer to the included LICENSE.md for license information.\nLibraries used: canvas-sketch, canvas-sketch-util, dom-events, hsv2rgb, keyframes, equations from easings.net, array shuffle from stackoverflow.",
