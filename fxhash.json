And yeah, Tyler Hobbs, we know you’re reading and are about to say we should use H, S, and B instead but you can shove it up your ass right along with your Fidenza billions. Real deep up there.\n \nUtility? With only 576 CryptoPixels you can make a CryptoPunk worth millions!\n \nRarity? Each pixel is provably unique (in the Heraclitean sense). And you know how one of your drunk crypto bros mentioned hashes once and it was the only word short enough for you to remember after blacking out? We give you 3 hashes. Think of the street cred with the even dumber fuckers out there buying random numbers!\n \nBullshit hidden messages? Oh yeah, you’re getting excited now, aren’t you? We’ve done some real alien shit and buried blueprints for a spaceship in here. You just have to work with the “community” to combine your pixels into the plans. Real. Fucking. Interstellar. Travel. How’s that roadmap?\n \nIs this art? Are you art?",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\nBecause this is an NFT in PFP format, you can put it on your avatar on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nDesigned by: @morteza_yousefy\nMade in 2022",

And yeah, Tyler Hobbs, we know you’re reading and are about to say we should use H, S, and B instead but you can shove it up your ass right along with your Fidenza billions. Real deep up there.\n \nUtility? With only 576 CryptoPixels you can make a CryptoPunk worth millions!\n \nRarity? Each pixel is provably unique (in the Heraclitean sense). And you know how one of your drunk crypto bros mentioned hashes once and it was the only word short enough for you to remember after blacking out? We give you 3 hashes. Think of the street cred with the even dumber fuckers out there buying random numbers!\n \nBullshit hidden messages? Oh yeah, you’re getting excited now, aren’t you? We’ve done some real alien shit and buried blueprints for a spaceship in here. You just have to work with the “community” to combine your pixels into the plans. Real. Fucking. Interstellar. Travel. How’s that roadmap?\n \nIs this art? Are you art?",

            "description": "Inspired and fascinated by Brutalism, Modernism and Bauhaus, I've started to explore the deeper connections of architecture using pixel art in a clean, minimalistic and unique way.\n\nThe BRUTALIST MOVEMENT project represents the next step in this process. It's an animated generative experiment that focuses on finding the simplest and fewest components that - when generated randomly - always create structures resembling buildings: from small modern houses through industrial facilities to gigantic brutalist monuments.\n\nThis resulted in 4 main components: Base, Extension, Gap and Window. These entities are used randomly to create Blocks that form the final structure. \nThe whole process is also strictly accompanied by 4 distinct components to hold colors and to be set by randomly chosen palettes: Sky, Sun, Shadow, Window.\n\nFeatures consist of a mixture of the above components.\n\nThe project is animated to show how the buildings come to life. It's also a nice way to show what's going on in the background, because from time to time a bigger block would surely hide interesting smaller ones :) \n\nPress these keys:\n's' - to download a larger resolution PNG\n'n' - to shuffle through the 'depth' of Blocks, aka placing them from front to back and vice versa. This is a nice feature to show structures hidden by others and also a cool way to create iterations inside the iteration - sub-iterations - we can say :)\n'r' - to reset the Blocks' depths to default\n\nPlease note:\nEverything you see is generated, animated and drawn real-time. No layered transparent PNGs, PFP or similar!\n\nHave fun and inspiration!\n\n\n@cloudnoise © 2022\n\n☁︎\n\nCreated with P5.js library.",

And yeah, Tyler Hobbs, we know you’re reading and are about to say we should use H, S, and B instead but you can shove it up your ass right along with your Fidenza billions. Real deep up there.\n \nUtility? With only 576 CryptoPixels you can make a CryptoPunk worth millions!\n \nRarity? Each pixel is provably unique (in the Heraclitean sense). And you know how one of your drunk crypto bros mentioned hashes once and it was the only word short enough for you to remember after blacking out? We give you 3 hashes. Think of the street cred with the even dumber fuckers out there buying random numbers!\n \nBullshit hidden messages? Oh yeah, you’re getting excited now, aren’t you? We’ve done some real alien shit and buried blueprints for a spaceship in here. You just have to work with the “community” to combine your pixels into the plans. Real. Fucking. Interstellar. Travel. How’s that roadmap?\n \nIs this art? Are you art?",

            "description": "There’s so much more to our world than what we are able to perceive, let alone understand. Will we ever be able to even fully understand ourselves?\n\n–\n\nElevation is a series of 320 generative elevation drawings of imaginary structures. It is a reminder of the limits of our consciousness, and an ode to the manifold nuances that lie beyond what we can perceive, beyond what we even can imagine.\n\nAs a generative artist, I aim to elevate my own consciousness with the help of the machine. I welcome algorithms and randomness into the creation of my works, taking full control, and intentionally giving it away, always seeking to expand my imagination. For as humans alone, we remain limited to our own edifice of thought, and often fail to free ourselves from the visible, mundane world.\n\nBoth are present in Elevation: the visible and the imaginary, the mundane and the transcendent, the solid and the fragile. Where an architect’s elevation drawing marks the transition from the thought world into the visible world, Elevation remains in-between, depicting both the idea of an imaginary structure, and the structure itself.\n\n–\n\nElevation is intended for print. All holders of an Elevation NFT will be able to order the corresponding signed print in the respective paper format via andreasrau.eu/elevation. Press [s] to save the image as displayed or [p] to generate a print-ready PNG image at 300 dpi. This might take a while, depending on paper format and your hardware.\n\n–\n\nElevation\np5.js, glsl, html, css\nAndreas Rau, 2022",
