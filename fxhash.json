            "description": "'Murals' is a collection of 256 abstract compositions born out of an intense period diving deeply into street art, pointillism and the inner workings of neural networks.\n\nThe work explores projection, refraction and abstraction of points as they ripple through multi-dimensional space-time. Points refract through multi-dimensional space to become shapes, which then become coordinate systems for the projections of new points that create a sense of form, texture, lighting, and material properties. \n\nThe work is also a celebration of imperfections and how a combination of many tiny – almost individually imperceptibly small – imperfect details can shape our perceptions of form, materiality, mood. This is explored within this work through subtle uses of sprays, flecks, scuffs, cuts, grain, targets (projections of projections), construction lines, base projections, occasional glitches that cause curvature, bounced light, shadows, and more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n15 colour palettes: \nScream, Night Bus, Double Backflip, Jaws, Sunday, Atom, Space, Tipex, \nGraphite, Leaf, Earth, Bubble Gum, Citrus, Jellyfish, Damp Concrete.\n\n4 times of day (that create subtle changes in light colour):\nDaylight, Winter Morning, Midnight, Sunset\n\n2 Border types: \nNormal, Thin\n\nVarious features that subtly impact appearance surface textures and shard forms:\nMetallic, Engrave, Number of Shards, Scuff Marks, Symmetry. \n\nControls:\n- Press [ S ] to save the work at its current image size as a PNG.\n- Press [ 1 ] to set the image size to 1440 x 1944 pixels (default size)\n- Press [ 2 ] to set the image size to 2880 x 3888 pixels\n- Press [ 3 ] to set the image size to 4320 x 5832 pixels\n\n- Press [ F ] to toggle freeform mode to create custom image sizes and aspect ratios\n- Press [ R ] to reload the image (for use in freeform mode)\n\nThis work has been tested on Chrome and Safari on Mac OS, and also using an Android smartphone. Please make sure that it works on your device before minting. Based on testing (in May 2022), each work should take about 5-10 seconds to fully load on a laptop or desktop machine, and 15-20 seconds on a mobile device. The loading process is animated so you can watch the construction the static artwork during this time. \n\nThis artwork is created with p5.js \n\n@nbswwit, 2022\n",

            "description": "Henge is an exploration of circular megalithic structures of the prehistoric age. It is a work of historical fiction where these stone assemblies, achieved through herculean efforts of stacking, aligning, and balancing immense chiseled rocks, are reimagined within an alternate universe of algorithmic possibility. Historically, henges share a few qualities that inspired this project. First, they are places of gathering within a loose collection of stones to organize ceremony or worship under celestial alignments. They are also monolithic in their materiality and employ the most elemental techniques of megalithic, or large stone, construction. These particular types of henges, known as cromlechs, are circular spaces fit with purpose and ritual and in this sense, serve as precedents to the great human edifices; charging landscapes with meaning and presence through geometry and order. Finally, henges are a collective language of place-making shared across a range of cultures and ages, from the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras and across territories from modern-day Morocco, Portugal, Brazil, Germany, Scandinavia, to the well-known Stonehenge in Great Britain.\n\nThis project is deeply inspired by the timeless and universal narrative created through the thoughtful and deliberate placement of large rocks in a circle. It seems that when confronted with marking a place and communing with nature, human beings like to make circles out of stones. Among all the symbols of place making, the circle is the original and still remains the most universal. Through the use of code to portray these imperfect structures, Henge animates the history of these circles in all their roughness and seemingly endless variation.\n\n\n--------\n\nCreated by Aranda\\Lasch @ArandaLasch\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\nNovember 2022\n\n[Interaction instructions]\n'left' + 'right' arrow keys to change view\n'i' saves a 2048x2048 PNG\n\n[Info]\np5.js\nHenge is optimized for Chrome, runs slowly on Firefox (the longer the wait, the more stones and/or grass are being generated)\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n10% of all primary and secondary proceeds donated directly to Girls Who Code\n",

            "description": "CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG is an homage to Ohne Titel (1969–1970) by Verena Loewensberg.\n\n2 of 5 in CENTURY-XXX, Series 2\nEdition of 128\n\nCENTURY-XXX is a series of software sketches that pay tribute to artists of the 20th century. Each piece is named after a specific artist and reimagines one of their original works through code, often by adding motion, variation, or interactive elements. These sketches don’t replicate the original artworks but instead extend their core ideas into new forms.\n\nBy “software sketch,” I mean something more informal than a finished artwork. While some of my projects take months or even years to complete, these sketches are created quickly—often in just a few days. They may be lighter in process, but they’re equally important to me. Sketching with code is how I think through ideas and discover new directions for future work.\n\nThe project began with the CENTURY exhibition at DAM Projects in Berlin in fall 2012, where I premiered Network C, Network D, and the first Signal to Noise software piece. Since then, these sketches have inspired more full-scale artworks like METASOTO, METAVASARELY, METAMOLNAR (also known as Hommage à Molnar), including the eponymous CENTURY released through Art Blocks in June 2021.\n\nCENTURY-XXX Series 1 was released from December 2021 to January 2022 in editions of 1,000. The first artwork in Series 2 followed in October 2022, also in an edition of 1,000. The remaining four works in Series 2 are scheduled for release starting in 2025, each in smaller editions of fewer than 128 based on what feels appropriate for the individual piece.\n\nThe long-term vision for CENTURY-XXX is to create 100 software sketches, each one inspired by a different artist and artwork from the 20th century.\n\nSERIES 1\n1.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMETAMALEVICH\n1.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMOLNAR(S)\n1.3 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMORELLET\n1.4 — CENTURY-XXX-METARILEY\n1.5 — CENTURY-XXX-METAKELLY\n\nSERIES 2\n2.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE\n2.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG\n\nMore CENTURY-XXX’s to come…",

            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

The Game of Life is a zero-player game, its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.\n\nMaps of Life is a generative-player game, an algorithm that creates an initial random configuration and a collector that observes how the configuration evolves. Each mint produces a distinctly unique cartographic representation of an ideal town, with different color palettes, scales, and coordinates, an animation from its random birth to a stopped moment in time.\n\nMaps of Life assumes that the built environment has a life of its own. And besides, only an automatic mind can name towns with Butterfly Names. Enjoy the view.\n\n---\nInteractivity:\nPress LEFT and RIGHT arrows to speed-up or slow-down the evolution of the town.\nPress \"S\" to save the current state to a PNG image.\nIf you want to change the resolution, just add \"?res=XXX\" to the end of the url.\n---\n\n(With these keys, you can possibly force the script to continue until its further completion.

            "description": "Element is a generative series of pixelated mosaics that explores two contrasting styles of generative art. One style embraces imperfection and noise to simulate paint or other real-life textures, while the other produces digital outputs with precise forms.\n\nThe mosaics were inspired by the works of Hiroshi Kawano, one of the pioneers of generative art. They are generated by randomly placing rectangles inside a grid then applying a Markov-chain process multiple times. A hand-drawn and organic style is then incorporated using various techniques such drawing many rectangles with subtle variations in colour for a paint texture or adding different kinds of noise.\n\nPlease view in full-screen for the best experience.\n\nPress [s] when the output is fully rendered to download it as a png file. The resolution can be set by adding for example \"&s=2048\" to the url for a 2048 x 2048 output.\n\nElement was released as part of the Cure3 exhibition, generating vital funds for Cure Parkinson's medical research.",

            "description": "ASCII-SCAPE\n\nLike for many others growing up during the 1980s & 90s, my very first hands-on encounter with actual computer graphics (outside of games) was in the form of \"textmode\" and its various alphanumeric characters and other symbols available on the 8bit home computers of that period. These machines were perfectly capable of producing fairly high-resolution & multi-color graphics (all relative), yet most systems booted into an interactive prompt with the so-called textmode as de-facto standard environment, providing a level, if also limited, playing field for the creation of text-based graphics from a patchwork of characters & symbols of a predefined font (system or custom). As is so often the case, limitation is the mother of invention and the regular, monospaced grid and standardized set of characters quickly encouraged an entire subculture of specialized designers & artists to emerge (which is currently being re-discovered & remixed by younger generations), applying & showcasing their creativity (with often surprisingly ingenious skills) in the form of game designs, user interfaces, disk mags, demoscene productions, competitions, flyers, BBSes and even various early Web designs of the mid/late 90s.\n\nASCII-SCAPE is an attempted non-nostalgic homage to these roots & culture. It is also a textmode-only (no canvas!) rework of my previous piece C-SCAPE. It combines my love of cellular automata with the stripped back aesthetics & limitations of using only text as representation medium of these co-evolving generative systems. It required an almost complete rewrite & re-curation of various elements: 1200+ new handpicked rule combinations, 32 character sets, 40 color themes, new relationships & biases to better manage the resulting textures, densities and contrast.\n\nAlthough technically not strictly \"ASCII\" (an actual standard, but also a popular shorthand for \"text only\"), the entire simulation only uses various Unicode characters and the beautiful Iosevka open source typeface by Renzhi Li aka Belleve Invis.\n\nLike its parent C-SCAPE, this project is dynamic and evolves indefinitely. It's best viewed on non-mobile devices, where there's a decent horizontal resolution to provide sufficient simulation space. Please see the C-SCAPE project description for further details. There's no graphical export feature, but output can be captured into an UTF-8 plain text file (max. 100k lines/generations).\n\nThe following keyboard shortcuts are available:\n\n- space : toggle simulation updates (pause/play)\n- r : randomize environment\n- x : start/stop recording\n- f : toggle scroll speed (fast/slow)\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nIosevka typeface licensed under OFL-1.1 license\n\nhttps://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and https://thi.ng",

For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

            "description": "This series explores the remnants and imprints of past events; the unintended consequences and marks left behind: The floor of a painter's studio, layered with splatters and spills; the face of a rock, sculpted by the relentless touch of water and ice; the rusty hood of a forsaken car, weathered and chipped under the harsh sun.\n\nThe art piece is crafted by an algorithm simulating the effects of abrasion from a consistent yet dynamic process. It links a thousand pairs of points, harmoniously shifting across the canvas, with delicate lines. At each intersection of these lines, color is applied. To produce the final piece, multiple layers of varying colors and intensities are superimposed.\n\n------\n\nControls:\n\n- [x] Save a PNG\n\n- [1] Set height to 768\n- [2] Set height to 1152 \n- [3] Set height to 1536 (default)\n- [4] Set height to 2304\n- [5] Set height to 3072* \n- [6] Set height to 6144*\n- [7] Set height to 9216*\n- [8] Set height to 11520*\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render height\n\n\n* images with height over 3000 pixels render without animating, downloads a PNG automatically after rendering\n\nPlease note that high resolution outputs will take several minutes or even longer to render. Highest resolutions have only been successfully tested with Safari on a Mac.
