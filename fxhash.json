Enabling this sort of co-creation between the algorithm and the user has been on my mind for quite some time and is most likely the first of its kind on this platform!\n\nDrawing conceptual inspiration from the mental patterns that each of us has, but can be unaware of, this is an attempt to visualize them using feedback loops. While minting, you can imagine sharing one of your patterns like this with the world.\n\nThe graphical style is influenced by the infinitely looping GIFs, and the effect itself is created using a bunch of simple circular geometries that are fed into feedback loops. The color gradients are made by something that could be called chromatic motion blur.\n\nControls\n[ space ] - pause\n[ f ] - fullscreen\n[ s ] - save the current frame as an image\n\nCreated with Three.js & TensorFlow\nCopyright (c) August - September 2023 Shaderism",

            "description": "Colour streaks refer to vibrant and bold streaks of different colors, which involve creating vibrant and dynamic combinations using streaks or lines of different colors. Characterized by their bold and energetic appearance, colors are often combined and layered to create a sense of movement and depth.\nDifferent techniques are usually used to apply colors on canvas or paper. This can include brush strokes, palette knives, or even pouring paint directly onto the surface. Colors are usually applied in long, flowing strokes, creating a sense of flow and rhythm.\nColors have a great influence on the mood and overall effect of the artwork. I chose complementary colors to create contrast and visual interest, and similar colors for a more harmonious and relaxing effect.\nOne of the key aspects of colour streaks is their ability to evoke emotion and stimulate the viewer's imagination. Vibrant colors and dynamic combinations often evoke feelings of joy, energy, or excitement. Flowing lines and color combinations can also create a sense of movement or evoke natural elements such as water or wind.\nOverall, colour streaks are a visually appealing form of abstract expression that celebrates the beauty and power of color. They invite viewers to immerse themselves in their vibrant world and interpret their meaning based on their own perceptions and feelings.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "Strands of memory are twisted and entangled with each other, blending in and out with the surrounding fog of chaos. Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

            "description": "Welcome to the ultimate pico_punk generator! This interactive token is a parameter based generator that creates unique pico_punk generators. Each one will generate one pico_punk with a number of layers chosen by you during the parameter selection phase. Additionally, you can use the buttons to navigate the generative space, and create your own pico_punks via an interactive process of discovery. This is the final pico_punk generator I intend to make, with the extra capabilities added by the parameter selection process, and the final tweaks and changes I made to the appearances and effects, I think this project is now as complete as I can ever make it.\n\nThe controls:\n- arrow keys: move through the generative space... each step adds one layer to the composition\n- x button: take a screenshot of the generated pico_punk\n- o button: clear all layers except the current one (clean slate for building a new pico_punk)\n\nEach layer has a chance to apply one of various visual effects, which vary in how transformative (or disruptive) they are.\n\n\npico_punks began as a project to create something akin to DOS Punks, but fully generative, without any manual intervention or pre-rendered components, using only the Pico-8 Fantasy Console. You can find the first generator here: (https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/439049). In this early version, the generator was interactive, but each pico_punk was totally isolated, being generated from one unique seed and one consistent process. Over time, this evolved to this final experience: one in which the \"curator\", the user exploring the generator, is not just choosing from an infinite number of punks, but actually the process of exploration itself is modifying the output before your eyes.\n\npico_punks is all about exploring themes of irreversibility, noise, pattern recognition, pareidolia, and of course identity. What began for me as something bordering on satire, has become an integral part of how I represent myself online. It is my sincere wish that with these tools you are also able to create something unique that you feel represents you, and is something that couldn't have been made without you.\n\nThank you so much for these last couple years of support, and here's to many more making and collecting art together :)\n\n\nNotes on minting: \n- 30% of royalties go to the minter\n- 10% of royalties go to previous curated pico_punk holders\n- One reserve spot is generated for each curated pico_punk held, and they stack\n- One extra reserve spot is for my Mom",

This project explores the timeless art of pottery through the lens of interactive generative art. In this artwork powered by fxhash, virtual ceramics, shaped by diverse artistic hands, come to life and are shared with the world.\n\nThis interactive pottery sim was written from scratch using vanilla JS and webgl shaders. A range of parameters are included to control the final scene and image via the fx params interface.\n\nThis artwork is part of the fxhackathon 2023 where artists were challenged to create projects using the interactive fx(params) system.\n\nStandalone Controls\n\nUse mouse or touch to control view\n1 - Toggle Edit Mode\n2 - Toggle WASD Free Cam\n3 - Toggle Frame\n4 - Save HD Image\n\nCredits\n\nCode and Outputs are Copyright 2023 Frank Force\nHash without Sine - MIT License - Copyright (c)2014 David Hoskins\nThank you to Inigo Quilez for 3D rendering articles and demos",

            "description": "\".printing\" will become one of the redeemable gifts for \".printed\" holders.\n\nNow, let's explore the merits of expressing art in the digital realm versus the realm of printed art.\n\nOne significant point, in my opinion, is the difference in the colors achievable through CMYK and RGB. This also leads to variations in texture.\nIn \".printed\" I have opted for a format where colors are selected from a designated palette. This decision is influenced by the limitations of the CMYK color gamut for printing, but it's also driven by a conscious choice to use colors like yellow, white, and black shades that evoke a sense of glossiness and beauty when printed.\nIn this instance of \".printing\" the wide range from #000000 to #ffffff is available for selection, based on the display's color reproduction. The ability for the minter, rather than the artist, to freely choose and combine colors adds an intriguing aspect unique to the params system.\n\nAnother key distinction lies in capturing a fleeting moment of fondness versus capturing an ongoing movement within the framework of code. Unlike GIFs or video files, the necessity for this art to be expressed through code, specifically p5js, is emphasized by the temporal changes brought about by noise(). The patterns in this piece possess reproducibility through a seed, yet theoretically, they continue to transform infinitely.\n\nThis project stands as a significant milestone in my personal exploration of the regular variations in noise function.The pattern of this project is not perfectly symmetrical.\n\nIn \"printed\" there's the joy of selecting a moment inherent to physical objects, coupled with a glossy texture.\n\nIn \"printing\" the temporal evolution offered by p5js noise() function intertwines with a palette of 16,777,216 colors.\n\nI hope you find enjoyment in both aspects.\n\nGenerative art by @dotconatus\n\nBuilt in Javascript with p5.js.",

This decision is influenced by the limitations of the CMYK color gamut for printing, but it's also driven by a conscious choice to use colors like yellow, white, and black shades that evoke a sense of glossiness and beauty when printed.\nIn this instance of \".printing\" the wide range from #000000 to #ffffff is available for selection, based on the display's color reproduction. The ability for the minter, rather than the artist, to freely choose and combine colors adds an intriguing aspect unique to the params system.\n\nAnother key distinction lies in capturing a fleeting moment of fondness versus capturing an ongoing movement within the framework of code. Unlike GIFs or video files, the necessity for this art to be expressed through code, specifically p5js, is emphasized by the temporal changes brought about by noise(). The patterns in this piece possess reproducibility through a seed, yet theoretically, they continue to transform infinitely.\n\nThis project stands as a significant milestone in my personal exploration of the regular variations in noise function.The pattern of this project is not perfectly symmetrical.\n\nIn \"printed\" there's the joy of selecting a moment inherent to physical objects, coupled with a glossy texture.\n\nIn \"printing\" the temporal evolution offered by p5js noise() function intertwines with a palette of 16,777,216 colors.\n\nI hope you find enjoyment in both aspects.\n\nGenerative art by @dotconatus\n\nBuilt in Javascript with p5.js.",
