            "description": "At the heart of the borders of imagination stands my creation, \"Fata Morgana.\" \nThis abstract work is a bold exploration of the boundaries between reality and dream, a subtle dance between dimensions of perception. \nI forged this vision by giving life to a structure that eludes the human eye like a mirage in a scorching desert.\n\nFrom a distance, this creation draws the observer into a world that merges and blends with reality. The structures emerge as promises of urban architecture, but as they approach, they crumble into patterns of light and color.\n\nColors harmoniously dance, gently fading through ethereal shades. The forms themselves seem to reject definition, refusing to adhere to the laws of perspective and geometry.\n\nThe backdrop of this illusory city is a palette of chromatic emotions. Here, the boundary between the real and unreal completely dissolves, and one finds themselves wandering in a limbo of perceptions, suspended between certainty and wonder.\n\nThe artwork is an invitation to explore the unknown, a celebration of the art of illusion. It is a place where the rules of physics give way to the uninterrupted dance of creativity. In this abstract vision, I hope that everyone can find their own interpretation, a personal meaning that reveals itself like a secret guarded among the nuances of light and shadow.\n\nTo change the density from 1 to 5 (incorrect results set to 1), double-click the left mouse button,\npress S to delete background.\n\nI used p5.min.js - p5.sound.js.",

At what point do you feel the dots begin to dissolve into a texture? When do you stop noticing the dots and instead begin to perceive the overall composition?\n\nThese questions are posed in a similar fashion as with meditation; at what point does something become something else? When does an in-breath become an out-breath and vice versa? \n\nContemplation on simple questions like these can open a small portal into stillness and mindfulness by taking time to slowly observe our responses. \n\n23 palettes are included, each named after different areas of Tokyo. \n\nPress 'S' to download a full size 6000px x 6000px PNG output. \n\nAs always, much gratitude and enjoy your piece.
