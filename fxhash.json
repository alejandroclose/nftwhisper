            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

Each piece is named after a specific artist and reimagines one of their original works through code, often by adding motion, variation, or interactive elements. These sketches don’t replicate the original artworks but instead extend their core ideas into new forms.\n\nBy “software sketch,” I mean something more informal than a finished artwork. While some of my projects take months or even years to complete, these sketches are created quickly—often in just a few days. They may be lighter in process, but they’re equally important to me. Sketching with code is how I think through ideas and discover new directions for future work.\n\nThe project began with the CENTURY exhibition at DAM Projects in Berlin in fall 2012, where I premiered Network C, Network D, and the first Signal to Noise software piece. Since then, these sketches have inspired more full-scale artworks like METASOTO, METAVASARELY, METAMOLNAR (also known as Hommage à Molnar), including the eponymous CENTURY released through Art Blocks in June 2021.\n\nCENTURY-XXX Series 1 was released from December 2021 to January 2022 in editions of 1,000. The first artwork in Series 2 followed in October 2022, also in an edition of 1,000. The remaining four works in Series 2 are scheduled for release starting in 2025, each in smaller editions of fewer than 128 based on what feels appropriate for the individual piece.\n\nThe long-term vision for CENTURY-XXX is to create 100 software sketches, each one inspired by a different artist and artwork from the 20th century.\n\nSERIES 1\n1.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMETAMALEVICH\n1.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMOLNAR(S)\n1.3 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMORELLET\n1.4 — CENTURY-XXX-METARILEY\n1.5 — CENTURY-XXX-METAKELLY\n\nSERIES 2\n2.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE\n2.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG\n\nMore CENTURY-XXX’s to come…",

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

            "description": "Simple shapes, when strewn broadly and systematically, suggest the presence of infinite creative possibilities and are capable of portraying a visceral excitement felt by mixing the energy of light with the contemplation of dark.\n\nThis exercise has been repeated for ages, and its relevance will remain for as long as light may meet dark. The silhouettes of Stonehenge battling against a bright sky, the wabi-sabi placement of rocks in a Japanese garden hugged by methodical raking, the play of shadows in Plato's Allegory of the Cave, and the playfully arranged cut-outs of collage or chemical photogram — these all attest to the unending dynamism of form when imbued with light and the contrast of its absence.\n\nAs absence and darkness are made visible, the trail of their path conveys a speed as fast as light, and dark shapes that are no less important than the brightest figures. A symbiotic coexistence of these forces was born with the universe – and a delicate balance remains between the powerful glare of light and the stealthy speed of dark.\n\nInspired by photograms and a little-known series by documentary photographer William Klein, Speed of Dark references the visual language of the darkroom and the history of photography as an underlying analog for how an emerging art medium can harness simple elements to create evocative expressions.\n\nChoose a resolution by adding \"&width=9000\" to the URL in live view.\nRemove the border by adding \"&noborder=1\" to the URL.\n\n__________\nTENDER x Laurent Houdard\nMay 2022\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Which is to say they are something we do for their own sake, in search of beauty, pleasure and meaning, a realm in which our subjective tastes and individual experiences are joined together into communities of critical judgement and overlapping but contested values'.\n\n\n\n'Pipes' is a reimagining of the game 'Pipe Mania', released in 1990 by Empire Software. While in the original game, the aim for the player is to connect a series of randomly generated pipe pieces to ensure the flow of 'goo' for a specified distance, in 'Pipes', unique left-to right-pathways are generated section by section.\n\n\n\nBy refiguring this game and its components into a generative collection, 'Pipes' forms a part of an overarching series, 'The Art of Play', which seeks to highlight the aesthetic beauty of early gaming software.\n\n",

            "description": "In his 2023 book, 'The Beauty of Play', Frank Lantz writes, 'Games are an aesthetic form. Which is to say they are something we do for their own sake, in search of beauty, pleasure and meaning, a realm in which our subjective tastes and individual experiences are joined together into communities of critical judgement and overlapping but contested values'.\n\n\n\n'Pipes' is a reimagining of the game 'Pipe Mania', released in 1990 by Empire Software. While in the original game, the aim for the player is to connect a series of randomly generated pipe pieces to ensure the flow of 'goo' for a specified distance, in 'Pipes', unique left-to right-pathways are generated section by section.\n\n\n\nBy refiguring this game and its components into a generative collection, 'Pipes' forms a part of an overarching series, 'The Art of Play', which seeks to highlight the aesthetic beauty of early gaming software.\n\n",

            "description": "The Waiting is over. It’s actually happening. We’ve teased, hinted, and honestly YEARNED for this release. We hope you enjoy.\n\nWTBS: Wearable #1 (cap edition) is a celebration of the 3rd anniversary of the Waiting To Be Signed Podcast. We mark this milestone in collaboration with artist Anna Lucia and are extremely pleased to bring you these one-of-a-kind generative caps. Each NFT in this series is an animated digital artwork which contains the embroidery design for a unique cap. When you obtain an NFT from this collection, you’re not only collecting digital art, you can also redeem a cap featuring the very design! \n\nGet your cap: \n\nAnna Lucia has curated a full collection using fx(hash)’s params function. At the time of sale, all NFTs will have already been minted by Anna Lucia & ready for sale. You can acquire your preferred design by placing an offer of $75 or more (in TEZ equivalent), which will be accepted by Anna. This price includes the NFT & cap but excludes shipping. Cap redemption will be handled via Artfora.com. \nIf you are not buying the cap directly from Anna Lucia’s wallet (tz1M7dt8sWC64ZXkmiWbttVCtgFrFU6Do9x9), please view the collection on Artfora to check whether the cap has already been redeemed or not. \n\nControls:\n\nThe NFT itself showcases the dynamic, animated generative design. Use the interactive controls to explore variations and preview how your chosen design will look on the embroidered cap. There are two colors cap, black and desert beige, represented by the background color and reflected in the mock-up. \n\nA -> Toggle between animated view and cap mock-up\nD -> Download the embroidery file \nE -> Detailed view of embroidery design \nR -> Record and download a .zip file of 300 frames\n\nOn mobile only the digital animated view is available. \n\nThis work is created with p5.js and stitch.js.
