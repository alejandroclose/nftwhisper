I combined elements of painting, the release of warm and cool colors and images of twisting and moving ocean currents into creative visual pieces that evoke a sense of the dynamic nature of the ocean.\nEach piece often features vibrant colors and fluid shapes that mimic water's flow to create intricate patterns that resemble swirling currents.\nWith this art form, I not only celebrate the aesthetic appeal of oceans, but also raise awareness of their importance in supporting marine life. Also reminding us of the interconnectedness of our planet's ecosystems in order to motivate us to appreciate and protect our oceans.\nWhether displayed in homes, offices, or public spaces, Ocean Currents will add calm and natural beauty to any setting. It serves as a visual reminder of the power and majesty of the ocean while inviting viewers to reflect on their connection to the natural world.\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",
