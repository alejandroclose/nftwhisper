Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\nAll That Could Be is about the inner life of pitch drops waiting for their inevitable fall.\n\nAfter first learning of the pitch drop experiment and understanding what this odd hyper-viscous liquid was… all I could think about was: How does the pitch feel about all of this? What does it dream of? How does it deal with this intense pressure to snap, drip and perform?\n\nAll That Could Be acts as a metaphysical microscope into the emotional state of the pitch. The anticipated explosion of energy and pain when it loses its battle with gravity… as well as daydreams imagined to brighten its dark, slow existence with vibrant, static-y layers… or fantasies of being anywhere else besides trapped in a funnel under a locked encasement for the entertainment/curiosity of others who just hope to see you snap into two.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://hereandnow.events/\n\nProcure a coin to participate in the event:\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/here-and-now:-edition-5\n\n————\n\nSome key commands in live mode:\n\nG : Toggle grain\nA : Toggle aura\nS : Save current resolution\n1 : 3000x3750\n2 : 4500x5625\n3 : 6000x7500\n4 : 7500x9375\n5 : 9000x11250\n6 : 10500x13125\n(1-6 work best on Chrome/Edge)\n(rendering takes longer as resolution increases)",

This is a character who ironically, because of the many social culture shifts in his life, began to resort to the way of putting other people's faces and stories on himself. At first it was necessary to adapt in a certain circle of society so as not to be a black sheep, after a few years he stopped noticing how the consciousness itself uses the stories or phrases he has already heard from absolutely different people received during a conversation, news or other, another of the features is the numerous personalities of Steven.\n\nI am creating this project because I have long wanted to try to tell people that being yourself is the most difficult and wonderful feeling. My goal is to get an animated movie adaptation on Netflix, the script will be written by anyone who wants to participate in the community. \n\nPeace be with you all!",

            "description": "Just,Steven - is a shell that has always followed me, or has been a part of me, I never fully understood. This is a character who ironically, because of the many social culture shifts in his life, began to resort to the way of putting other people's faces and stories on himself. At first it was necessary to adapt in a certain circle of society so as not to be a black sheep, after a few years he stopped noticing how the consciousness itself uses the stories or phrases he has already heard from absolutely different people received during a conversation, news or other, another of the features is the numerous personalities of Steven.\n\nI am creating this project because I have long wanted to try to tell people that being yourself is the most difficult and wonderful feeling. My goal is to get an animated movie adaptation on Netflix, the script will be written by anyone who wants to participate in the community. \n\nPeace be with you all!",
