Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

How we're all constantly on the go, whether that is physically, or mentally. Almost feeling like a monsoon. A storm of information. A storm of life. A storm of work. A storm of thoughts. A storm of emotions. A storm of everything. And it's all so fast.\n\nAs are the particles. They're all moving around these cyclones of information. Glowing up like neon signs in a busy city. Moving so fast it's almost a blur. Forming into something greater than the sum of its parts.\n",

In all that vastness, we are the smallest fraction of time imaginable, floating around on a speck of dust. Yet somehow, we continue to work, learn, build relationships, create, and participate in all these other odd, uniquely human practices. It’s truly fascinating, when in the grand scheme, none of it seems consequential.\n\nAmara Celestial is an artistic representation of this intergalactic madness and the love for it. To expand on the project’s identity…Amara, my wife’s name, has many meanings. In her culture and family, it means “love” or “everlasting beauty”. Celestial most commonly refers to things not of this world, but from the sky, or space. The shapes, lines, and primary design of this project represent the unpredictable nature of the universe. The entire piece is stippled with thousands of points of various palette selected colors, to resemble the uncountable number of light sources in the great sea of space, as well as to provide textural depth.\n\nThe Features:\n- Canvas Style: Pretty simple, the canvas can be square (2048 x 2048), portrait (1352 X 2048) or landscape (2048 x 1352).\n- Palettes: There are 10 different palettes, each with equal chance of being randomly chosen. The palettes were heavily influenced by my wife. She is a woman of South American descent and loves the bright colors and contrast often seen in the traditional clothing and art of her culture. There are a few muted palettes, including a mono palette to mix things up!\n- Background Color: The background color can be black, white, or blue with varying rarity.\n- Background Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the background shape (if drawn).\n- Primary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the primary shape (i.e., the foremost shape).\n- Secondary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the secondary shape.\n- Posterize: This is a color limiting filter that can cause harsher (less smooth) changes in color. The lower the number, the more abrupt the changes (2 being the lowest allowed).\n- Primary Shape Centered: This is a true/false based on whether the primary shape is centered on the canvas.\n- Background override: This will override the selected background and replace it with vertical or horizontal lines, or prevent the background shape from being drawn entirely.\n\nOther randomness factors (non-features)\n- Stroke thickness on various shapes and points of the project.\n- Size of the overall shapes, as well as the size of the inner radius of the shapes.\n- Spacing between the stippling and lines (to keep it pattern-less).\n- Positioning of all the shapes (restricted to the canvas).\n- The number of iterations (rings) for each shape.",

The lower the number, the more abrupt the changes (2 being the lowest allowed).\n- Primary Shape Centered: This is a true/false based on whether the primary shape is centered on the canvas.\n- Background override: This will override the selected background and replace it with vertical or horizontal lines, or prevent the background shape from being drawn entirely.\n\nOther randomness factors (non-features)\n- Stroke thickness on various shapes and points of the project.\n- Size of the overall shapes, as well as the size of the inner radius of the shapes.\n- Spacing between the stippling and lines (to keep it pattern-less).\n- Positioning of all the shapes (restricted to the canvas).\n- The number of iterations (rings) for each shape.",
