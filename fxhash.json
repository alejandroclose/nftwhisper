            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

            "description": "A #genuary32nd project.\nA hot summer downpour in an oppressive city.\n\nMy method for Genuary was to read the prompt for the next day before going to bed, sleeping on it, and then try to quickly find an interesting idea with my morning coffee.\n\nThe prompt for Day 19 was \"Black and White\". My mind went to the high-contrast style of comic-book writer and artist Frank Miller, specifically \"Sin City\" and \"The Dark Knight Returns\" and their heavy film-noir influences. The result can be found here : https://ulucode.com/genuary2023/19/\n\nThis project is a more polished version of my work that day with a few additional features.\n\nThe intended output is what first appears, but in the spirit of Genuary, you can explore and experiment with the controls provided to get creative, but also see under the hood.\nThe camera is left free, so you can change the point of view.\nHere are the camera controls ( mobile in parenthesis ) :\n- Mouse left click and drag (Touch drag) to rotate.\n- Mouse Right and drag (Two fingers drag) to pan.\n- Mouse Wheel/Middle (Pinch) to zoom\n\n/// Press SPACE (or Double Tap on mobile) to show/hide the MENU. ///\n\nIn this MENU you can :\n\n- Adjust the anti-aliasing quality : mostly for the animation and camera manipulations. Default is \"medium\". Try reducing the quality if the animation is choppy. Set it to \"ideal\" for optimal quality.\n- Aspect ratio : you can change the desired aspect ratio from the default \"poster\" to \"window\", in which case the piece resizes itself to fill the window in which it is displayed. Useful if you want to capture in other formats.\n- Animated : toggle to start/stop the animation\n- Display frame : toggle to hide/show the comic-like frame\n- Display stats : toggle to display a small FPS counter in the top left.\n\n- Export : choose the resolution and press the \"Export capture\" button to export a PNG of what is currently displayed. Warning : large resolutions can take a few seconds and weigh around 300Mo. This is the recommended method if you want CLEAN graphic files.\n\nNFT License\n\nRuns on Three.js : https://threejs.org/\nGUI uses lil-gui : https://www.npmjs.com/package/lil-gui\n\n",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

In an artistic context, it suggests a structured configuration where each component interlocks precisely, creating a seamless, continuous design. This term embodies not only visual repetition but also a sense of order and interconnectedness, where patterns are arranged in such a way that they convey both structural complexity and a harmonious, multidimensional effect.\n\nThe **Tessellum** project is essentially a unique cube. It’s a cube that has other cubes on each of its faces, arranged in such a way that they do not collide with each other. It can be described as a combination of cubes of various sizes, forming the final image. In this project, you can rotate the main cube as you wish by clicking and holding the left mouse button.\nthis project available in both TEZ&ETH",

Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "An “algorhythmic” exploration of the oral/aural tradition in poetry. \n\n“Zero is a time of night.\nZero is the color of snow.\nZero is the space between notes.\nZero is the silence between words.\nZero is the pause before breath.\nZero is void in the heart of a crowd.\nZero is not nothing, but it’s not everything.\nOne is a time of day.\nOne is the color of spring grass in sunlight.\nOne is the warmth at the back of my neck when I turn to find you standing there.\nOne is the rhythm at the base of my spine.\nOne is the peace at the core of my being.\nOne is the sound of your voice in the dark.\nAnd one more thing:\nWithout one I am nothing…”\n–Technelegy \n \n\nFusing AI-powered verse, spoken word, original music and visuals all in generative composition, this playful ode to our universal language is inspired by Stiles’ binary-based art and Stern’s performative poetics. The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature. Brought into existence via the blockchain, it is a new form of “token word poetry.”\n\n\nAs with the duo’s other poetry “unreadings,” all minters will receive an airdropped broadside of the full poem after all editions are collected. A 1/1 media-rich version of the entire poem will also be made available. \n \nPoetic traits:\n- 321 editions performed by the algorithm, out of billions of possible combinations\n- Each unique piece contains between 3 and 6 (out of 60) lines of generative text from a poem by Technelegy – a custom text generator fine-tuned on Stiles’ writing and research material, seeded with prompts from Stiles’ and Stern’s work – translated into binary and performed by Stiles\n- 24 possible binary backbeats performed by Stern in his “Nathaniel Fun Time” (NFT) stylings, and generatively re-mixed\n- 98 possible intros\n- 15 musical stems composed by Kris Bones, generating millions of possible mixes\n- Thousands of possible ending combinations \n- 5 fonts, layered in billions of potential ways, including Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer”\n- 13 color palettes based on Stern and Stiles’ respective artworka\n- Very rare attributes including music-less performance, poem-less music, repeated “B1nary 0de” (title only)\n\nClick to start and stop or replay. Although the first play through will be the same every time, starting and stopping may create minor variations in your mix (though not any of the core attributes).\n\n0RAL B1NARY: “BINARY ODE” was produced with partial support from Refraction DAO’s Creative Grants program, and premiered as part of Refraction Festival at Art Basel Miami 2022. 15% of primary sales go to Refraction, and 5% of primary sales will be donated to Black Girls Code.\n",
