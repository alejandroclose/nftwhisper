            "description": "Each monogrid artwork gets initialized with a start up algorithm that builds up a set of rectangles and fills them with pixels. There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance ‚Äî one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world ‚Äì its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world ‚Äì with all worlds ‚Äì by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering ‚Äì generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",

            "description": "..some times before \nthis nft-circus hit the town\n\nAnd forgot all about this sketch and work, for a while\n\n\nWhen you mouse click \nyou get an extra bonus full screen version\nI released this work, and several versions, \nearly februari 2019, posting images on some boards\n2nd version, also will adjust to your screensize\n\nAlso passing the fx key.. that unique minty fresh adres that got minted;\nto that fullscreen og version as well \n\nChanged \nMath.random() to $fx.rand and fxhash-preview stuff\n\nAfter a while, the work will change and draw a new scene / space\n\nGladly \nsurfing the  deterministic balance in the space and fxhash-rules\nI could make 2+ versions this time, don't you love technology?  =_______=\n\nalso added as a lil bonus this time\n\na lil image scaling tool\nyou could use; running fxhash sketches in your own browser \nand showing them in real large image sizes\nmy computer can handle like these 8000*8000 at the moment.\n\n(if the thing is stil working, or emulated lol.)\n\nI let your browser and system handle that, \nuse at your own risk and brains\ncreating bigger images, like could slow the system down\n\n\nOk \n- a 800x800 fxhash thumbnail version at the start\nand when you click it.. \nyou get the original version, that will adjust to any screensize\n\nAlthough deterministic\nthe camera and perspective will change depending the screensize-ratio.\nalthough it will render always the same for the same screensize\n\nThe thumbnail and saved copy-image of the canvas \nis-can be partly transparent as well.. \nthe background color of the page also is used at the start\nwhen early thumbnail or saved image\n\nI tried kept the work intact, like the way I wrote and released it back then\n\nstill love to see some of the nice images generated \nand things that can happen\nwhen I check it again\n\nrightclick - copy/save image like the old-days, or screenshot-printscreen\n\nFrom 1999+ I created several browser/netart-projects\nthat would also adjust to any screensize\n\nthinking.. can it run any screensize?! 0__.\nyou still can check some out\nsome with fullscreen interactive animation and fun experiments\ngot some older archives online like my xs4all.nl/~elout website.. archive\nYou can use the `CheerpJ Applet Runner extension` \nto run-emulate these old java-applets in your browser (fullscreen)\n\n\nAround 2015, when chrome all of a sudden decided \nto block/not run my webgl-three.js works, my tools and experiments for a while.\nI started working on a software based-3D engine again\nwritten in vanilla javascript this time\n\nBack in the late 1990's\nI would like hang around on like #java irc\nit's was bit like current days of discord. /irc/telegram?\nalso having a lot of fun together\ncheck bash.org for some of those og. internet classics\nAnd making your own 3D engine was like the coolest thing to do =____=\nand like John Carmack and his crew \nwas this amazing big inspiration \nto a lot of coders, gamers and people in the 90s\n\nI'm still using some of my old code and routines, \nlike filters and matrix functions from the early 90s\nI started to work on, and use as a student, we had to do for classes \n2D / 3D routines that changed a bit over the years\nsome you can check at: elout.home.xs4all.nl/index2001.html\n\n\n\nAt one moment\nI really wanted to do perspective correct texture mapping as well\nbut that resulted in.. rewriting and reworking this 3D engine of mine,\nfrom scratch again\n\nNever released this project, but  for  some preservation.. and the data gods -___-\nI decided to mint it on fxhash \nand kept the original code of this project, quite intact and messy. \n\n\n\nextra extra read all about it\nadded also a small 'iframe' tool\n`change-remove` the url part\nwhen it starts with ?fxhash\n\nreplace \n?fxhash=ooAQDTviR1Cd62738eT5ZKATwUhXuyC.etc.etc.yada_yada\n\nwith \niframe.html\n\nto make it run\n\nshow sketches, any screen size you want\nheh. use it at your own risk.\n\n\nnov.18 2023\n__. .  .  -___- =_______= \nxxx amsterdam chill'n out",
