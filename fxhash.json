This project, initiated this spring, allowed me to delve into various mechanics and approaches. Today, I am concluding this inaugural study on the cube and publishing it on fxhash, with the aim of sharing it and enabling others to play around with the parameters that make it up.\n\nThanking each individual who has contributed to this project, whether intentionally or otherwise, would be a lengthy task, and I risk forgetting someone. Therefore, a huge thanks goes out to the community here and on OpenProcessing for their ongoing exchange of advice and knowledge.\n\nWhile the code remains riddled with errors, I won't be progressing further with this initial project. This will presumably allow me to avoid overworking on subsequent projects. :-)\n\nmade with p5js, p5.grain and chroma.js\non Openprocessing https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1962145\n",

The less practical and most bizarre, basically the most overcomplicated self-made tool anyone could ever imagine. But it's THE tool to explore ideas.\nI created this one to investigate, to poke and nudge at a few concepts that seem to go hand-in-hand.\nFirstly, Representation, as in changing something to better explain it. Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.\n\nWhile many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.\n\nBut there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.\n\nI can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.\n\nWhat happens when a flower has more petals than pixels? Why do we know there's more layers to that thumbnail?\nMy best answer is:\n\n--Press \"s\" key to save a bigger image (2400x3200 px)\n",

The less practical and most bizarre, basically the most overcomplicated self-made tool anyone could ever imagine. But it's THE tool to explore ideas.\nI created this one to investigate, to poke and nudge at a few concepts that seem to go hand-in-hand.\nFirstly, Representation, as in changing something to better explain it. Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.\n\nWhile many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.\n\nBut there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.\n\nI can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.\n\nWhat happens when a flower has more petals than pixels? Why do we know there's more layers to that thumbnail?\nMy best answer is:\n\n--Press \"s\" key to save a bigger image (2400x3200 px)\n",

            "description": "This work is composed of a combination of grids with line patterns, like my previous work \"Infinite Animation\" (Project #15745).  However, whereas the previous work was characterized by simplicity and regularity, this one is much more chaotic.\n\nFirst, while in the previous work the grids were fixed at 3 x 3, in this work there are variations from 5 x 5 to 20 x 20. \nAnd in this work, it is YOU who rotates the grid. Clicking on a grid rotates it 90 degrees and changes the image. If you have difficulty locating the grid, press the \"g\" key on the keyboard to display a guide (for touch devices, long press to show/hide the guide).\nIf you get tired of clicking, you can ask your computer to help you. You can toggle the animation mode with the \"a\" key on the keyboard (for touch devices, swipe up to turn on the mode, swipe down to turn it off). In animation mode, the computer rotates a random grid at regular intervals. (The surrounding frame turns green in animation mode.)\n\nThe fun of generative art lies in finding value, or to stretch the point a bit, destiny, in the random coincidences created by computers. Therefore, it is not aesthetically pleasing to artificially modify the derived result later. However, dynamism is also a characteristic of digital art. The fluidity of the results is probably one of its interesting features. I experimented with it in my previous work, \"Abstract Calligraphy\"(Project #15384), and have done it more characteristically in this project.\n\nThis picture is like a puzzle game, but there is no correct answer. No, there may be a correct answer. It depends on your aesthetic sense. Let's enjoy collaborating with the computer!",

It’s less of a technical discussion, and more about the experience of the artist, and how it became linked with the feelings they associate with the art.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nFor higher resolutions, you can append “&density=2” to the url to double the size, “&density=3” to triple, and so on.\n(This is highly recommended.)\n\nTo adjust grain, you can append “&grain=##” to the url. 40 is the default, and 0 will remove it completely.",
