            "description": "This work was inspired by Otsu-e(大津絵), a Japanese painting in the Edo period. Otsu-e were inexpensive paintings made as souvenirs. Although mass-produced using paper stencils, the artisans painted by hand, resulting in variations in the quality of their work. Connoisseurs found them interesting and collected them as works of art. Otsu-e showed a new value of beauty in Japanese art, different from Ukiyo-e (浮世絵) which are prints, and from fine art paintings which are one-of-a-kind artworks.\n\nThis work is made of canvas2D Bezier curves. Not just a combination of parts, but also a random displacement of the Bezier curve points to lose the shape. This is intended to create fun with the Otsu-e-like effect.\n\n\nFeatures:\nThis profile is made up of 8 parts (brows, eyes, nose, mouth, ear, contour, hair, and body). Each part has 100 basic types. \nThere are 7 skin colors and 12 kimono colors. Each RGB value of the colors is randomly added within a range of ±10. In addition, there are 70 kimono patterns. \nThe distortion rate due to displacement of Bezier curve points is 0.0~50.0. \n\n\nBTW The title \"Henoheno\" is taken from the Japanese character picture \"Henohenomoheji\" known since the Edo period.",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch C has added a subtractive / destructive element to the simple grid from Sketches A and B. Colors are mostly the same, but more variation has been added to the outputs as well as the hue and saturation of the colors themselves. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch C has added a subtractive / destructive element to the simple grid from Sketches A and B. Colors are mostly the same, but more variation has been added to the outputs as well as the hue and saturation of the colors themselves. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.",

Franke. www.tribute-hwf.com\n\n\"Since the classical age of Greece, the golden ratio has been well known as the most balanced and therefore most aesthetically perfect proportion. In fact, it is supposedly often found in the fine arts and architecture and it is certainly important in geometry. But where is the proof that it is really the most beautiful proportion?\n\n\"The computer is proving to be a useful tool in exact art theory. Works of computer art are produced with the help of programs that describe the logic of the construction and its relevant measures. By varying the parameters you can vary the shapes of objects, and on the basis of the reaction of the public you can determine the best option. So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n\"A statistical evaluation would be interesting.

As a result, some of the outputs might be weird, messy, or even bordering on broken (if you get one of the latter please let me know and I'll reimburse you).\n\nDespite being a bit rough around the edges, I hope fx(mash) reflects some measure of my love for the fxhash community. If you're feeling kind, then perhaps it even harks back to the experimental early days :)\n\nThe last year has been an incredible journey, thank you for letting me be a part of our story so far.\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press [s] to save the current image\n- Press [g] to toggle grain\n- Press [h] for a high-res output\n\nBeta Controls (in live view, definitely not fully tested):\n\n- Press [p] to start/pause animation\n- Press [i] to slow down animation\n- Press [o] to speed up animation\n\nAll primary sales go to Savepakistan.\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nfx(mash) uses Gorilla Sun's grain implementation, a big thanks to him and meezwhite for a great article that is well worth supporting https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/all-about-that-grain\n\nThank you to the artists who created the following collections.

            "description": "fx(mash) is my humble contribution to celebrating #fxhashturnsone\n\nThis series is based on a simple algorithm - lines of a random length are drawn on a square grid until the grid is full.\n\nI have added a variety of features based on some of my favorite fxhash projects and a few special guests.\n\nThis collection is intentionally diverse and disorderly, that's a nice way of saying I only had a short period of time following the release of Acequia. As a result, some of the outputs might be weird, messy, or even bordering on broken (if you get one of the latter please let me know and I'll reimburse you).\n\nDespite being a bit rough around the edges, I hope fx(mash) reflects some measure of my love for the fxhash community. If you're feeling kind, then perhaps it even harks back to the experimental early days :)\n\nThe last year has been an incredible journey, thank you for letting me be a part of our story so far.\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press [s] to save the current image\n- Press [g] to toggle grain\n- Press [h] for a high-res output\n\nBeta Controls (in live view, definitely not fully tested):\n\n- Press [p] to start/pause animation\n- Press [i] to slow down animation\n- Press [o] to speed up animation\n\nAll primary sales go to Savepakistan.\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nfx(mash) uses Gorilla Sun's grain implementation, a big thanks to him and meezwhite for a great article that is well worth supporting https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/all-about-that-grain\n\nThank you to the artists who created the following collections.

            "description": "An “algorhythmic” exploration of the oral/aural tradition in poetry. \n\n“Zero is a time of night.\nZero is the color of snow.\nZero is the space between notes.\nZero is the silence between words.\nZero is the pause before breath.\nZero is void in the heart of a crowd.\nZero is not nothing, but it’s not everything.\nOne is a time of day.\nOne is the color of spring grass in sunlight.\nOne is the warmth at the back of my neck when I turn to find you standing there.\nOne is the rhythm at the base of my spine.\nOne is the peace at the core of my being.\nOne is the sound of your voice in the dark.\nAnd one more thing:\nWithout one I am nothing…”\n–Technelegy \n \n\nFusing AI-powered verse, spoken word, original music and visuals all in generative composition, this playful ode to our universal language is inspired by Stiles’ binary-based art and Stern’s performative poetics. The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature. Brought into existence via the blockchain, it is a new form of “token word poetry.”\n\n\nAs with the duo’s other poetry “unreadings,” all minters will receive an airdropped broadside of the full poem after all editions are collected. A 1/1 media-rich version of the entire poem will also be made available. \n \nPoetic traits:\n- 321 editions performed by the algorithm, out of billions of possible combinations\n- Each unique piece contains between 3 and 6 (out of 60) lines of generative text from a poem by Technelegy – a custom text generator fine-tuned on Stiles’ writing and research material, seeded with prompts from Stiles’ and Stern’s work – translated into binary and performed by Stiles\n- 24 possible binary backbeats performed by Stern in his “Nathaniel Fun Time” (NFT) stylings, and generatively re-mixed\n- 98 possible intros\n- 15 musical stems composed by Kris Bones, generating millions of possible mixes\n- Thousands of possible ending combinations \n- 5 fonts, layered in billions of potential ways, including Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer”\n- 13 color palettes based on Stern and Stiles’ respective artworka\n- Very rare attributes including music-less performance, poem-less music, repeated “B1nary 0de” (title only)\n\nClick to start and stop or replay. Although the first play through will be the same every time, starting and stopping may create minor variations in your mix (though not any of the core attributes).\n\n0RAL B1NARY: “BINARY ODE” was produced with partial support from Refraction DAO’s Creative Grants program, and premiered as part of Refraction Festival at Art Basel Miami 2022. 15% of primary sales go to Refraction, and 5% of primary sales will be donated to Black Girls Code.\n",
