            "description": "I had a wonderful childhood. I grew up near a big lake, in a house with a huge garden. You could get lost for the whole day, building houses on trees, collecting flowers and stones or stealing food from the vegetable garden. Having a brother of the same age made things even better, endless adventures with somebody saving you every time you are too dumb to realize you are walking into troubles.\n\nWe enjoyed the summers with the hot days, the fireflies and the nights full of falling stars. The winters with the snow, the stalactites and our box turtle disappearing for months to then reappear in the spring (Until she did not).\n\nAt the same time, taking care of the garden was a big responsibility, affecting our family life in many ways. Numerous times, I felt like the efforts we were putting in to keep it in order were never enough and nature was always faster in restoring her point of view. A struggle that affects us humans since we started to bend nature at our will, thousands of years ago.\n\nIn my gardens, I tried to capture this struggle, this constant fight to shape nature at our will.\nHowever, I also tried to represent the beauty that can be found in both savage and human shaped nature, if shaped with love and respect.\n\nI dedicate this project to my grandfather, who gave us a garden.\nI am sure he would have loved it.\n\n---\n\nHand coded with love and obsession. 💚\n\nPowered by p5, p5.createLoop and chroma.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\nPress ‘m’ to open a menu with the available outputs.\n\nThe generation of a hi-res image, up to 8000x8000, takes a few seconds.\nThe generation of an Animated GIF takes several minutes and the save command works only once the GIF is complete.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters that can be used to load different configurations.\n\n- mode = 0 | 1\n0 For static PNG images, 1 for animated GIFs\n\n- size = s | m | l\nThe Size of the output, 1080x1080, 4000x4000, 8000x8000 for static images and 512x512, 800x800, 1080x1080 for animated GIFs\n\n- fps = 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30\nFrames per second of animated GIFs\n\n=============> PROFILES <==============\n\t\nWeeds ------------------> 42%\nShapes -----------------> 7%\nFlower Power -----------> 5%\nStrips -----------------> 5%\nBadlands ---------------> 5%\nCircle Flower Packing --> 5%\nIna's Farm -------------> 5%\nFortified Pond ---------> 3%\nFalling Into You -------> 3%\nCultivar ---------------> 2%\nThe Hedge --------------> 2%\nRocky Mountains --------> 2%\nUnreachable Rivers -----> 2%\nMushrooms Heaven -------> 2%\nDante ------------------> 1.75%\nAcid Lands -------------> 1.75%\nProvence ---------------> 1.5%\nThe Springs ------------> 1.25%\nSecret Garden ----------> 1%\nThe Pump ---------------> 1%\nTetris -----------------> 1%\nThe Spiral -------------> 0.5%\nKinetic Sculpture ------> 0.25%\n\nInsects are visible only in the animated outputs.\n\n=============> MAKING OF <=============\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/article/the-making-of-noisy-gardens\n\n---",

            "description": "Mecha-Bamboo is the second installment in the Mecha series, where I attempt to blend mechanical elements with nature.\n\nThe main building blocks used in this piece are metal pipes, nuts and bolts forming bamboo stems and mending plates extending outwards with sharp metal scraps at their ends resembling branches and leaves. \n\nThere are 4 main arrangement variations \n\t- Two abstract variations with the metal bamboos growing out of the sides and border (20% chance each)\n\t- Two landscape arrangements, one on flat planes and the other on floating platforms.  (30% chance each)\n\nThe dominant stroke and fill colors are chosen at random from the RGB color space and are only recomputed if certain contrast criteria aren't fulfilled. \nIn combination with one of 10 hand-selected color palettes used for accents, this allows a great variation of different possible color schemes.\n\nThe structure and appearance of the bamboo, its stems and leaves are controlled by over 50 parameters that are chosen at random, giving each iteration a unique style.\n\n\n\nKeys: \nS - Save PNG image\nV - Open SVG Export menu\nSpace - Pause\n\nPlotting:\nYou can export a plottable SVG of each iteration by opening the export menu. I plot these on A3 with a 0.1mm fineliner. But depending on the density of the iteration other choices might be better suited. \n\n\nThe image is generated entirely in Javascript and the postprocessing is done with a custom shader. If there is no webgl support, the image will render without any postprocessing. You can force this by appending the URL parameter \"?noWebgl=1\".\n\nLibraries used:\nThree.js & EffectComposer\nJavascript-Voronoi by gorhill\nperlin.js by  Joseph Gentle\ndat.gui",

Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "https://www.bfos.art/projects/adherence\n\n======~~~~~~~~~~===================\nWe aren’t all moving in the same direction.  Sometimes we strictly follow the paths we are destined for.  Sometimes we meander in our own way and on our own time.  Let’s explore the ways that these different paths can create beauty.\n=================~~~~~~~===========\n\n\n============Adherence?=============\nThe title feature of Adherence controls how obediently each of the streamers follow their curated path and whether they die off when destined. While each mint will have a default level of adherence, everyone will be able to see what their piece would look like at all other levels of obedience.\n\nYou might prefer to live life conservatively doing everything that is expected of you…but then you’ll be surprised at what joy and beauty can come from a rebellious spirit.\n\n\n============No Restraint============\nThis project is definitely not a lesson in artistic restraint. It has been very exciting for me to grow this project along with my learnings. I’ve spent 6 months building, adding, cutting, and tweaking.  All of this wrestling has left an embarrassingly mangled code base.  That said, I truly believe the diversity of the output-space is worth it.  \n\nDuring development, I encountered some very severe roadblocks, some of which I felt I might never be able to resolve. One in particular, related to ensuring this project is dimensionless, actually brought me to tears once I finally worked through it. Similarly, there were a fair number of major leaps that took just a few minutes from concept to implementation. \n\nMy objective for my next project will be to bring more restraint…for the sake of my sanity if nothing else. It might take me just as long to complete and I expect that it will be a far smaller release, but I’ll still put just as much care into making sure I deliver a quality project for anyone willing to mint.\n\n\n============Open and Ugly============\nI won’t be obscuring my code.  Anyone is free to use browser dev tools to look and learn to their heart’s content.\n\nBe ye forewarned, though.  It’s not pretty.  I started out well enough, but little tweaks here and there to play and expand on the project has resulted in a code base I might be a little embarrassed about.\n\nBut, that’s OK!  We are all in this together and maybe this will be a way of helping others not feel intimidated by a sense of perfection.  I have also included fairly verbose comments, too, as added commentary to my insanity.\n\nI hope that my openness and vulnerability will be seen by everyone in the community as an invitation to connect with me for any reason.  If you'd like to ask me any questions about this project, about my collecting, about learning to code, about working through challenges, or whatever else...please don't hesitate to ping me in just about any of the fx(hash) related discords (Kaloh's, TENDER, fx(hash), clewcrew) or on twitter.  \n\n\n============Interactions============\n{F}eatures\n{P}rogress\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{N}oise Switch\n{1-3} Adjust Adherence\n{4-9} Save at x² resolution\n{I}nfinite Animation Modes - [Experimental] \n\nThere are two infinite animation modes.  I call them experimental because they didn't quite reach the level of polish that I would have preferred.  \n\nThe first mode is a loop-with-reverse.  It runs efficiently, but I think it's a little too obvious what it is doing.  It also messes with the background color.\n\nThe second mode is a more subtle loop that I actually love, but performance is VERY dependent on your device.  My M1 Mac runs it fairly well, but most other devices struggle through frames.  Even at a lower framerate, I think it's a neat effect.  Though, I wish I was able to figure out a way to improve the performance.  I tried a lot of tricks, but none helped that much.\n\n======~~~~~~~~~~==============================~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~==============================\n\n",
