            "description": "INSPIRATION\n\nSpirali was inspired by Tyler Hobbs' work with flow fields. However, instead of selecting random starting points for each shape to be drawn, which is more usual in flow fields works, I wanted to constrain the starting points to certain positions so that the shape being drawn could expand freely without the risk of colliding with other shapes, that's when I got to the spiral flow field.\n\nWHY SPIRALI?\n\nThe name of this collection is not only a direct translation of spirals in Italian, but it is also related to Italian cuisine and my own personal experience in Italy. The relationship with Italian cuisine is due to the immense number of types of pasta that exist, including one called spirali. When I was a child I only knew three or four types of pasta, but when I became a bit older I was amazed to learn that there were many more. Actually, there are hundreds. Just like from the same type of basic dough, you can make hundreds of types of pasta, my idea was, from just one type of spiral flow field, to make hundreds of images. A strategy of forcing creativity by imposing a major constraint.\n\nThe name of this collection also relates to my personal experience because it was visiting Italy many years ago that I first became interested in art and design because of the beautiful buildings, churches and works of art that I came across.\n\nDESIGN STRATEGY\n\nA spirali is made up of several tails and each tail is made up of a basic element, which I called slice. A tail may have from one to thousands slices. It is mainly the variation in the number of slices and how they are colored that creates the different tail styles in each spirali.\n\nThe slices start at the center of the spiral and in each iteration they grow a certain length or split in two depending on the parameters used in the algorithm, which also determine the outline and fill of each slice when it is rendered.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe main features that a spirali can have are:\n\n- Styles: Refers to the drawing patterns of each tail, that means, the shape, fill and stroke of the slices that form the tail. There are about 16 possible styles from which the algorithm will choose about 3 for each spirali.\n\n- Zoom out: It is related to how much larger the flow field area is in comparison to the image area. There are two possibilities: 50% and 100%.\n\n- Curvature: An arbitrary measure of the rate the tails of a spirali are turning. A spirali can have high or low curvature.\n\n- Rotation: The rotation direction: clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n- Tails: The number of tails in a spirali.\n\n- Palette: The palette's name. There are about 14 possible palettes.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n\n- Press \"m\" to export a medium resolution image (2000px x 2000px);\n- Press \"h\" to export a high resolution image (6000px x 6000px);\n\nLICENSING\n\nPlease see license.txt file.\n\nTwitter: @PauloSilvaGArt\nSite: https://paulosilva.art",

They might also be imposing most of the time to us as a misty forest that contains plenty of diverse habitats. \n\nThe point with these beautiful is that they are too complex ecosystems because they're formed by numerous tree layers. Since these forests that consist of different types of trees develop in areas laden with water vapor or dew at the flora level, the degree of sun exposure is reduced, which makes the evaporation of water by plants much lower. \n\nAfter this information about the misty/foggy forests, I wanted to give the name called 'Rudeneja' which describes the way nature and/or the weather begins to feel like Autumn. I've tried to achieve that by creating a dense layer of trees, fog, grasses, and leaves. Also, the blur effect I've applied after all layers gives a nice depth effect in the composition. Each different color spot for the element of the piece translates the art's structure to a possible iteration.

The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid.

The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, Ren√© Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n‚ÄúSouthern Gothic‚Äù borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O‚ÄôConnor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",

Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, Ren√© Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It‚Äôs one of the first collections of generative PFP‚Äôs based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead‚Äôs Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn‚Äôt stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world ‚Äì more specifically in the xDeads world ‚Äì the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

            "description": "I had a wonderful childhood. I grew up near a big lake, in a house with a huge garden. You could get lost for the whole day, building houses on trees, collecting flowers and stones or stealing food from the vegetable garden. Having a brother of the same age made things even better, endless adventures with somebody saving you every time you are too dumb to realize you are walking into troubles.\n\nWe enjoyed the summers with the hot days, the fireflies and the nights full of falling stars. The winters with the snow, the stalactites and our box turtle disappearing for months to then reappear in the spring (Until she did not).\n\nAt the same time, taking care of the garden was a big responsibility, affecting our family life in many ways. Numerous times, I felt like the efforts we were putting in to keep it in order were never enough and nature was always faster in restoring her point of view. A struggle that affects us humans since we started to bend nature at our will, thousands of years ago.\n\nIn my gardens, I tried to capture this struggle, this constant fight to shape nature at our will.\nHowever, I also tried to represent the beauty that can be found in both savage and human shaped nature, if shaped with love and respect.\n\nI dedicate this project to my grandfather, who gave us a garden.\nI am sure he would have loved it.\n\n---\n\nHand coded with love and obsession. üíö\n\nPowered by p5, p5.createLoop and chroma.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‚Äòs‚Äô to save the current output.\nPress ‚Äòm‚Äô to open a menu with the available outputs.\n\nThe generation of a hi-res image, up to 8000x8000, takes a few seconds.\nThe generation of an Animated GIF takes several minutes and the save command works only once the GIF is complete.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters that can be used to load different configurations.\n\n- mode = 0 | 1\n0 For static PNG images, 1 for animated GIFs\n\n- size = s | m | l\nThe Size of the output, 1080x1080, 4000x4000, 8000x8000 for static images and 512x512, 800x800, 1080x1080 for animated GIFs\n\n- fps = 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30\nFrames per second of animated GIFs\n\n=============> PROFILES <==============\n\t\nWeeds ------------------> 42%\nShapes -----------------> 7%\nFlower Power -----------> 5%\nStrips -----------------> 5%\nBadlands ---------------> 5%\nCircle Flower Packing --> 5%\nIna's Farm -------------> 5%\nFortified Pond ---------> 3%\nFalling Into You -------> 3%\nCultivar ---------------> 2%\nThe Hedge --------------> 2%\nRocky Mountains --------> 2%\nUnreachable Rivers -----> 2%\nMushrooms Heaven -------> 2%\nDante ------------------> 1.75%\nAcid Lands -------------> 1.75%\nProvence ---------------> 1.5%\nThe Springs ------------> 1.25%\nSecret Garden ----------> 1%\nThe Pump ---------------> 1%\nTetris -----------------> 1%\nThe Spiral -------------> 0.5%\nKinetic Sculpture ------> 0.25%\n\nInsects are visible only in the animated outputs.\n\n=============> MAKING OF <=============\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/article/the-making-of-noisy-gardens\n\n---",

            "description": "Among the thousands of different types of natural ecosystems, we come across some that are more bizarre than others and have particular characteristics. They might also be imposing most of the time to us as a misty forest that contains plenty of diverse habitats. \n\nThe point with these beautiful is that they are too complex ecosystems because they're formed by numerous tree layers. Since these forests that consist of different types of trees develop in areas laden with water vapor or dew at the flora level, the degree of sun exposure is reduced, which makes the evaporation of water by plants much lower. \n\nAfter this information about the misty/foggy forests, I wanted to give the name called 'Rudeneja' which describes the way nature and/or the weather begins to feel like Autumn. I've tried to achieve that by creating a dense layer of trees, fog, grasses, and leaves. Also, the blur effect I've applied after all layers gives a nice depth effect in the composition. Each different color spot for the element of the piece translates the art's structure to a possible iteration. The features of the project are below, you can review and try them through the variations. \n\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Back Trees Density: Very low-26%, Low-6%, Medium-7%, High-9%, Very High-52%\n- Big Tree: true-89%, false-11%\n- Leaves: true-29%, false-71%\n- Back Trees Type: Poplar-16%, Elm-9%, Sycamore-12%, Eucalyptus-11%, Dogwood-9%, Horse Chestnut-15%, Serviceberry-13%, Ginkgo Biloba-11%\n- Big Tree Type: Poplar-11%, Elm-10%, Sycamore-8%, Eucalyptus-9%, Dogwood-14%, Horse Chestnut-17%, Serviceberry-18%, Ginkgo Biloba-13%\n- Gray Scale: true-17%, false-83%\n- Fog Density: Very Low-17%, Low-14%, Medium-17%, High-23%, Very High-29%\n- Grass Colors: Absolute Dark-26%, Ebony Clay-13.5%, Rosy Brown-4.5%, Black Olive-9%, Black Eel-5.25%, Crater Brown-6.75%, Cork-6%, Bleached Cedar-3.75%, Night-7.5%, Gray-15.75%\n- Sky Colors: Gray-26%, Dark Blue-%9, Bordeaux-6.75%, Dark Sienna-5.25, Dark Blue Gray-6.75%, Tuna-6%, Asphalt-4.5%, Light Burgundy-5.25%, Clear Blur-4.5%, Black Bean-6.75, Bean Red-4.5%, Light Green-6.5%\n- Leaves Colors: Black-26%, Night-10.5%, Blur Charcoal-6.75%, Jaguar-7.5%, Wood Bark-6.75%, Sepia Black-10.5%, Dried Blood-14.25%, Dark Teal-8.25%\n- Fog Colors: Gray-27%, Lavender Pinocchio-11%, Link Water-10%, Pale Aqua-13%, Blossom-13%, Summer Green-13%, Jungle Mist-13%\n- Light Direction: Left-38%, Right-41%, Behind-21%\n\n\nPress 's' to export a 2000x3000 png file in live mode.\n\nThe project was tested on desktop Chrome 105.0.5195.127, Mozilla 104.0.2, and Edge 105.0.1343.42 versions.\n\nMade with p5js.\n\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0 LICENSE\n\nSeptember 2022 / Rhaegar",
