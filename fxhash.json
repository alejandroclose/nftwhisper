            "description": "We have an impossible plan:\nTo negate any plan.\nLet ideas drop, and bloom\nand their fruits, crystalize.\n\nFeel the call of intention,\nlaser focus on this, not that;\nOr let it dilute in randomness,\na liberated slide left and right.\n\nStacking sketches and notes\nwe look at a mirror as we type,\nare we looking for something\nor has something already found us?\n\nWe move in oblique patterns,\nfinding meaning in the fray.\nIf our art takes on a life of its own,\ndo we simply guide it on its way?\n\n________________\n\n\nConcept:\n\nObliqua is a visual meditation on a generative artist's dilemma, the tension between conscious search and fortuitous find. And a question for both artist and observer: What is \"meaning\", if there's any, and who is in charge of that? By evoking (apparent?) dualities such as incipient/completed, natural/artificial, flat/volumetric, and outdated/advanced..., the piece welcomes ambiguity as a dear and helpful friend.\n\n\nMinting Params:\n\nSome parameters define geometric structure and layout while others control more stylistic or expressive features. Color palettes have been composed and chosen as they are presented, but they can be slightly adjusted with contrast, saturate and brightness params. Some style options can be toggled on/off with your keyboard (i.e. you may want to toggle grain off for printing). Please read below.\n\n\nLive mode controls:\n\nPress the following keys to download the artwork at different sizes:\n- S: Current size (default 2100 x 2970 px)\n- 1: Small, 2100 x 2970 px\n- 2: Medium, 4200 x 5940 px\n- 3: Large, 6300 x 8910 px\n- 4: Largest, 8400 x 11880 px\n- V: SVG (multiple-file download)\n\nAnd these other ones for toggling style options:\n- L: Toggle Glow\n- R: Toggle Grain\n- H: Toggle Shadow\n- W: Toggle Worn\n- F: Toggle Frame\n\n\nNotes:\n\n- Some outputs can be quite intensive in terms of computation, especially at higher resolutions, so they require a capable, relatively modern computer and browser. Best viewed in Chrome. Firefox and Edge should work too, although slower. Safari is not supported. Please make sure the artwork is rendered properly on your device and browser before minting.\n- SVG can be downloaded for plotting. For convenience, the download is split into different files for lines and fills. Fills will always be exported as solid colors.\n\n\nAcknowledgments:\n\nThanks everyone who provided help directly or indirectly by publishing useful articles, online-forums threads, and giving support and feedback on Twitter, Discord, and elsewhere.

            "description": "Orbit of Influence is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, ZeroSpace NYC, 2023 and is a unique generative program created using processing's p5js and SVG. Developed from scratch, it employs a system of rule-based environments that have been a source of satisfaction for me since 1995.\n\nThe program generates three invisible planets, each at a different scale - small, medium, and large. Fifty objects then randomly select a planet, a speed to orbit around it, and one of three brush sizes - small, medium, or large. These objects move around their respective planets, painting color and texture across the planetary orbit in three-dimensional space.\n\nTo reveal the blueprint of the system, press the \"s\" key on your keyboard. The hidden algorithm that governs the brushes' movement is then displayed, revealing a mesmerizing display of synchronized choreography as the brushes interconnect with each other.\n\nPress the following keys to interact :\n\n- '1': swap the background color to \"ocean\"\n- '2': swap the background color to \"mist\"\n- '3': swap the background color to \"lilac\"\n- '4': swap the background color to \"amethyst\"\n- '5': swap the background color to \"crimson\"\n- '6': swap the background color to \"emerald\"\n\n- 'l': toggle animation loop on/off\n- 's': system reveal, show the blueprint of the algorithm\n\nJoshua Davis / PrayStation 'Orbit of Influence' / (2023) real-time generative program, 1240 x 1653 px, Date Minted: April 2023\n\nTwitter: @joshuadavis\nInstagram: @praystation\nWebsite: https://joshuadavis.com\n\nBio :\n\nSince 1995, Joshua Davis is an artist, technologist, author and designer in algorithmic image making & animation. Using programming, he writes his own code to produce interactions with users and to generate visual compositions according to rule-based, randomized processes.\n\nJoshua has exhibited his works and/or lectured at the Ars Electronica (Austria), Centre Georges Pompidou (France), Contemporary Arts Center (Cincinnati), J. Paul Getty Museum (Los Angeles),  the Tate Modern (London), the Design Museum (London), the Institute of Contemporary Arts (London), PS.1 MoMA (New York), the Whitney (New York), the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum (New York), the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (Spain), among others.\n\nSince 2000, Joshua has lectured globally about his work, inspirations and motivations at museums, galleries, institutions, art festivals, etc., and has spoken at the TED (2005) and 99U (2013) conferences about his career in algorithmic image making and open source.",

            "description": "This project is my first one in a series of algorithmic studies. Inspired by the work of Casey Reas and his \"Process Compendium\", it starts with a very simple text description of an algorithmic process. In this case, I came up this description:\n\n\"Place N circles randomly on the canvas. Select a point on each of the circles, and rotate it around its circle. At each step, draw a random line that connects all the points\"\n\nEach step is drawn with very low opacity, and is repeated a large number of times (these pieces draw around 6 million lines). Eventually, complex structures, shapes and patterns appear, that were impossible to predict from the text description alone: this is an emergent system.\n\nThe text description voluntarily leaves things open to interpretation: how many points ? which colors to use ? which rules for the drawing opacity and line weight ? Do all points move at the same speed ? Can they accelerate ? Are the circles allowed to extend past the canvas boundaries ?\n\nThis makes the process capable of interesting variations, as well as reusable: another artist implementation of the same description would most likely give very different artworks.\n\nDespite the apparent simplicity of the description, this collection ended up being a real challenge. Drawing millions of lines with low opacity turned out to be impossible without a GPU. WebGL is required.\n\nThis token uses the regl.js library. The outputs are rendered at 2400x2400 and should be viewed at that size. You can generate high resolution outputs, up to 8000px, by adding &size=XXXX to the URL.",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution. I tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge / Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iPhone, but please make sure it works on your device before minting.\n\n-----\n\nPossible features:\n\ncolor scheme: cairngorm, alborz, bardenas, atlas, bieszczady, watkins\n\nproportions: square, wide, standard, narrow\n\nframe: none, vignette, bright, dark, bright with vignette, dark with vignette\n\nvisitors: tourists, tourists and birds, solitary flock of birds, only light\n",
