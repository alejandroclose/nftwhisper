            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

            "description": "Terrain is an audiovisual experiment halfway between a self-modifying game board and an audiovisual interface. The unfolding algorithm is stuck infinitely in the process of filling its surroundings. However, infinite growth within a constrained environment that has limited resources is impossible. \n\nThe music is based on the steps of this never-ending game mechanic, creating a slow, continuously changing ambient soundscape. The initial structure of the board is generated with a simple L-System encoded in the token’s metadata, that is combined with a tessellation algorithm. The result is an area of regular shapes and forms, filled with vivid and contrasting colors that resembles navigational charts, philosophical games and digital cartography. \n\nIf you collect this artwork, you will support climate positive interventions: each iteration of the piece is automatically set to donate to environmental conservation funds upon minting. Terrain is transferring half of its primary sales to the following nonprofit organizations using crypto-for-charity: Clean Water Fund, RE-volv, Ocean Alliance Inc, Sustainability Matters, Flying Cloud Institute, Pacific Rim Institute for Environmental Stewardship, Amazon Conservation Association, National Parks Conservation Association, Earth Day Network Inc, Greenwave Organization Corp, Wild Tomorrow Fund, The Life You Can Save\n\nThis project is part of RefractionDAO’s Creative Grants Season 02, read more on its concept and motivations at https://x-terrain.github.io\n\nPress ‘s’ to start or stop the music sequence, ‘d’ to save still image\nTouch to listen, go full screen\n",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

Fixed Vertical Plates (Base default) oscillate left and right under a constant wind, showcasing a subtle yet perpetual motion. Both construction methods can be toggled by pressing [c] or [double clicking].\n\n[i] / [+]: Show Controls (After Mint)\n\nGraphics Controls\n[a]: Reset to original mode\n[c] / [double click]: Toggle plate construction mode - from top hung to fixed vertical\n[l] / [space]: Toggle draw mode - from line to solid\n[m]: Toggle background colors - from original, black, colored, white\n[k]: Toggle full color to gray\n[e]: Toggle canvas extension (2x original size)\n[b]: Hide/unhide border & text\n[1] to [9]: Select resolution\n[0]: Select highest resolution (may not work during wind effect)\n[s]: Save artwork as PNG (select resolution before save, default: 1)\n\nAnimation Controls\n[mouse over]: Wind effect during top hung mode\n[/] / [*]: Decrease / increase wind magnitude\n[v]: Toggle volume off/on\n[g]: Save animation as GIF (wait for 1-minute; may not work for complicated graphics)\n\nCreated using p5.js.\nSound Effect from Pixabay\nWind Scene (Tezos) © 2024 by Leo Hu is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nRemember to tag me:\nX / Farcaster: @LeoHuGArt | IG: leohugart",

            "description": "Inland Emotions\n\nOver the centuries, ancient philosophers and modern psychologists have come to the same basic conclusion. The fact is that, according to a few millennia of research, there are a limited number of distinct human emotions, predefined by the human psyche. Sometimes it may seem like we are experiencing a \"new\" one, but on closer inspection, we see that it is the known emotions that are superimposed. Emotions are what they are, and they exist in the same way in each of us, whether we recognize them for what they are or not. But as our history blends into a new emerging state of the world, a whole new range of emotional responses are triggered within us. An infinite maelstrom of variations generated from a simple combination of a few emotions.\n\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nInland Emotions by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

This setting defines the ratio.\nOpacity - Opacity is applied to the background as well as all objects\nObject Scale - Adjust the object sizes\nGrid Scale - Adjust the size of the 4 x 4 grid used for object placement\nObject Ordering - Controls the order of rendering for large vs small objects\nRandom Seed - This overrides the fxhash seed so what you see after setting all parameters is what you'll get when you mint. When using params this value is initially seeded using the fxhash seed so it is highly unlikely that two mints would be identical",

            "description": "===== A Simple Fail =====\n\nAn attempt to release a quick follow-up to Adherence following simple rules and a concise set of features has utterly failed!  I ended up spending 9 months of development on this \"quick\" project; I didn't even spend that much time on Adherence.  What happened?  First, and foremost, I had no intention to ever release a project that I wouldn't be absolutely excited about if I were to see in the Incoming feed as a collector.  Nothing wrong with that, right!?  But, not all factors that delayed this project were so noble.  I have to admit that as I continued to stack features and techniques, my codebase, once again, has gotten away from me.  I'm not too worried about how poor my code will look to lurkers (although, God help them!).  But, poor code, without question, hampers the ability for a developer to iterate.  Each shortcut a developer takes lays traps along paths that will eventually be revisited and I took A LOT of shortcuts in my excitement of each new idea.\n\nAppropriately, my failures are fully in keeping with the project itself.  A Simple Fail explores a favorite generative theme of human imperfection through the construction of each mints foundational grid to the \"inaccuracy\" of draw styles that fill each shape.  \n\n<Read more about A Simple Fail:\n@ https://www.bfos.art/projects/a-simple-fail \n@ https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/a-simple-fail>\n\n\n==== fx(params) Info ====\n\nWARNING: 1-Day Grace Period!\n\nThere is only a 24 hour grace period before mint tickets will need to be protected with the params tax.  Why?  Because there is currently no way to trade mint tickets during the grace period.  If you don't mint your ticket immediately, I STRONGLY suggest that you immediately update the price and tax coverage on your mint ticket.  This should only matter in the fortuitous case of a sell out, but I wanted to make sure this was communicated clearly just in case!\n\nI had initially decided to not include params in this project at all.  I think params are great, but most projects released with params so far have suffered because of them, in my opinion.  Params often detract from the artist's efforts to craft the feature-probability space and tuning of the project.  I put a lot of effort into that in this project and I didn't want to see collectors struggle to replicate what I've already crafted.  That said, I loved the restrained way Tyler Boswell (@teaboswell) implemented params in Reunion to give collectors a limited ability to choose their mints.  I thought 25 seeds per wallet was a little on the light side.  So, I have doubled that to 50 potential mints a wallet can choose from.  I have also configured an option to mint a completely random mint in the traditional style.  The features in your mint might include a complementary tip of the hat to your faithfulness for being so bold!  This option is selected by default.\n\n\n===== Interactions =====\n\n{A}dapt to device screen size (twice to rotate, thrice to original)\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{P}erfect grid switch\n{Z}oom switch\n{1-8} Save at x multiple of screen size\n\n== Print Options ==\n{B}ackground switch\n{F}rame switch\n{G}rain switch\n{H}ighlight switch\n\n== URL Parameters (useful for adjusting and saving on mobile devices) ==\n(Start your group of parameters by appending \"&\" to the end of your token URL following the fxparam parameters.

            "description": "The third and final installment of the Self trilogy.\n\nEgo is defined as: the one of the three divisions of the psyche in psychoanalytic theory that serves as the organized conscious mediator between the person and reality especially by functioning both in the perception of and adaptation to reality.\n\nPlease see attached fx(text) article or go to https://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy for more on concept/mechanics/etc. It’s a bit of long read, but worth it.\n\nThis is an fx(params) project and you will be able to choose exactly what your iteration will look like. For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",
