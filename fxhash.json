            "description": "The third and final installment of the Self trilogy.\n\nEgo is defined as: the one of the three divisions of the psyche in psychoanalytic theory that serves as the organized conscious mediator between the person and reality especially by functioning both in the perception of and adaptation to reality.\n\nPlease see attached fx(text) article or go to https://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy for more on concept/mechanics/etc. It’s a bit of long read, but worth it.\n\nThis is an fx(params) project and you will be able to choose exactly what your iteration will look like. For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

We as humans have a need to leave traces - stories - that others can read and learn from. What will be the traces machines want to leave? This piece employs sinusoidal signals drawn with lines as a simple metaphor for every trace and every language, for every message and every communication.\n\necologías-A is an entity that is part of a broader ecology. Released on occasion of the show \"Unbound - Ecology in the Age of Machines\" at Unit London. The data generated by this entity is read by a different piece minted on Ethereum, creating a link between Tezos and Ethereum, a metaphor for an ecology of blockchains.\n\nit shares a common element with two other works released on fxhash: ecologías B and ecologías C, all of them contributing data to aforementioned pieces.\n\nread more at https://www.iillucid.com/ecologias\n\n15% of primary sales are donated to institutions working towards improving biodiversity and environmental efforts.\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nBuilt on p5.js, glsl\n\nappend &pd=N (N a number) to the URL in live view to increase/decrease resolution\npress s to save current image in current resolution\npress z,x,g,b,n followed by +/- to increase/decrease, respectively, brightness, contrast, gamma, blur, noise",

            "description": "TOUCH👉🌱GRASS is a dynamic, immersive, and interactive browser-based experience that invites users to embark on a virtual journey of nature engagement. This unique NFT serves as a friendly reminder to occasionally unplug from the digital world, offering a digital substitute for touching grass when you can't physically step outdoors.\n\nTo interact with TOUCH👉🌱GRASS, simply hover your mouse over the digital blades of grass featured in the 3D environment. Each blade responds to your cursor by bending and changing colors, creating a tranquil and playful simulation of brushing your fingers through a lush, green meadow. As you interact with each blade, it changes its state and a counter in the top right corner of the screen decreases, tracking your progress.\n\nThe vibrant canvas, inspired by the natural sky colors, constantly changes hues, mimicking the dynamic nature of our physical environment. The piece incorporates a mesmerizing rain effect with each droplet represented as a particle falling through the virtual sky, adding to the overall tranquility and charm of the artwork.\n\nMoreover, the NFT creates a unique visual and user experience for every interaction. It uses simplex noise and other randomizing elements to vary the position, scale, and movement of the grass blades and raindrops, as well as the color palette of the sky and ground.\n\nOnce all the grass blades have been interacted with, you'll be rewarded with a heartening message encouraging you to disconnect from the digital and immerse yourself in the real world, reinforcing the underlying message of the artwork: to take a break from screens and embrace nature.\n\nTOUCH👉🌱GRASS beautifully combines digital technology with a traditional love for nature, prompting us to reflect on our balance between the online and offline world. It's not only an interactive piece of digital art, but also a gentle reminder to appreciate and engage with the natural world around us.\n\nWhether you are an avid NFT collector or simply an art enthusiast, TOUCH👉🌱GRASS is a delightful and refreshing addition to any digital collection.\n\nSo go on, TOUCH IT! 👉🌱\n\nhttps://gotouchgrass.online\n\n2023 ｡ₓˑ༺ʚ♡ Violet Forest ♡ɞ༻ˑₓ｡",

            "description": "TOUCH👉🌱GRASS is a dynamic, immersive, and interactive browser-based experience that invites users to embark on a virtual journey of nature engagement. This unique NFT serves as a friendly reminder to occasionally unplug from the digital world, offering a digital substitute for touching grass when you can't physically step outdoors.\n\nTo interact with TOUCH👉🌱GRASS, simply hover your mouse over the digital blades of grass featured in the 3D environment. Each blade responds to your cursor by bending and changing colors, creating a tranquil and playful simulation of brushing your fingers through a lush, green meadow. As you interact with each blade, it changes its state and a counter in the top right corner of the screen decreases, tracking your progress.\n\nThe vibrant canvas, inspired by the natural sky colors, constantly changes hues, mimicking the dynamic nature of our physical environment. The piece incorporates a mesmerizing rain effect with each droplet represented as a particle falling through the virtual sky, adding to the overall tranquility and charm of the artwork.\n\nMoreover, the NFT creates a unique visual and user experience for every interaction. It uses simplex noise and other randomizing elements to vary the position, scale, and movement of the grass blades and raindrops, as well as the color palette of the sky and ground.\n\nOnce all the grass blades have been interacted with, you'll be rewarded with a heartening message encouraging you to disconnect from the digital and immerse yourself in the real world, reinforcing the underlying message of the artwork: to take a break from screens and embrace nature.\n\nTOUCH👉🌱GRASS beautifully combines digital technology with a traditional love for nature, prompting us to reflect on our balance between the online and offline world. It's not only an interactive piece of digital art, but also a gentle reminder to appreciate and engage with the natural world around us.\n\nWhether you are an avid NFT collector or simply an art enthusiast, TOUCH👉🌱GRASS is a delightful and refreshing addition to any digital collection.\n\nSo go on, TOUCH IT! 👉🌱\n\nhttps://gotouchgrass.online\n\n2023 ｡ₓˑ༺ʚ♡ Violet Forest ♡ɞ༻ˑₓ｡",
