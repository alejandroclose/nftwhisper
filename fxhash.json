I gained a lot of experience along the way and I really liked the creation process.\n\nI wrote an article in which I report on the creation process in more detail. It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\nüëì thousands of different outputs are possible\nüë®‚Äçüíª only code\nüé® 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \nüé• animated\nüñ±Ô∏è interactive (+controls for mobile)\nüòé augmented reality view\nüü• different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\nüñºÔ∏è save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\nüìº save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress ‚Äú5‚Äù to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú6‚Äù to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú7‚Äù to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú8‚Äù to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress ‚ÄúArrowDown‚Äù for restores the original camera view\nPress ‚ÄúD‚Äù to switch to next composition\nPress ‚ÄúA‚Äù to switch  to previous composition\nPress ‚ÄúS‚Äù to start animation\nPress ‚ÄúSpacebar‚Äù to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú1‚Äù to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú2‚Äù to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú3‚Äù to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention!

            "description": "After 4 months of coding the Generative Glasses is ready! I gained a lot of experience along the way and I really liked the creation process.\n\nI wrote an article in which I report on the creation process in more detail. It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\nüëì thousands of different outputs are possible\nüë®‚Äçüíª only code\nüé® 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \nüé• animated\nüñ±Ô∏è interactive (+controls for mobile)\nüòé augmented reality view\nüü• different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\nüñºÔ∏è save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\nüìº save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress ‚Äú5‚Äù to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú6‚Äù to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú7‚Äù to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú8‚Äù to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress ‚ÄúArrowDown‚Äù for restores the original camera view\nPress ‚ÄúD‚Äù to switch to next composition\nPress ‚ÄúA‚Äù to switch  to previous composition\nPress ‚ÄúS‚Äù to start animation\nPress ‚ÄúSpacebar‚Äù to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú1‚Äù to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú2‚Äù to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú3‚Äù to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention!

            "description": "After 4 months of coding the Generative Glasses is ready! I gained a lot of experience along the way and I really liked the creation process.\n\nI wrote an article in which I report on the creation process in more detail. It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\nüëì thousands of different outputs are possible\nüë®‚Äçüíª only code\nüé® 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \nüé• animated\nüñ±Ô∏è interactive (+controls for mobile)\nüòé augmented reality view\nüü• different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\nüñºÔ∏è save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\nüìº save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress ‚Äú5‚Äù to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú6‚Äù to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú7‚Äù to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú8‚Äù to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress ‚ÄúArrowDown‚Äù for restores the original camera view\nPress ‚ÄúD‚Äù to switch to next composition\nPress ‚ÄúA‚Äù to switch  to previous composition\nPress ‚ÄúS‚Äù to start animation\nPress ‚ÄúSpacebar‚Äù to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú1‚Äù to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú2‚Äù to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú3‚Äù to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention! Thanks for the support! Thanks for the opportunity fxhash and genart community! I hope I was able to contribute to generative art with my work!\n\n@C4RC0\ncarco.hu",

            "description": "After 4 months of coding the Generative Glasses is ready! I gained a lot of experience along the way and I really liked the creation process.\n\nI wrote an article in which I report on the creation process in more detail. It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\nüëì thousands of different outputs are possible\nüë®‚Äçüíª only code\nüé® 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \nüé• animated\nüñ±Ô∏è interactive (+controls for mobile)\nüòé augmented reality view\nüü• different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\nüñºÔ∏è save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\nüìº save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress ‚Äú5‚Äù to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú6‚Äù to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú7‚Äù to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú8‚Äù to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress ‚ÄúArrowDown‚Äù for restores the original camera view\nPress ‚ÄúD‚Äù to switch to next composition\nPress ‚ÄúA‚Äù to switch  to previous composition\nPress ‚ÄúS‚Äù to start animation\nPress ‚ÄúSpacebar‚Äù to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú1‚Äù to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú2‚Äù to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú3‚Äù to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention! Thanks for the support! Thanks for the opportunity fxhash and genart community! I hope I was able to contribute to generative art with my work!\n\n@C4RC0\ncarco.hu",

After that made this generative stuff for fxhash's birthday bash.\n\n#fxhashturnsone\n\nDonations:\n25% to ThreeJs team\n\nThe image contains a binary coded word or phrase with a length of 8 characters. The grays represents 0, the other colors represents 1. One row -> one character. Should be proceed decoding from left to right and from top to bottom.\n\nAn example: 'iloveyou'\n\n01101001\n01101100\n01101111\n01110110\n01100101\n01111001\n01101111\n01110101\n\nThe fxrandom selects a word and the program converts it to binary data. After that, the background (ground and sky) is randomly generated from color schemes. Then the binary gray colors are drawn. Also the color of light next to null colors is randomly generated from color schemes. Random affects also the animation.\n\nThe animation stops when you do these interactions below, then restarts after a few seconds of inactivity.\n\nPress spacebar to change:\n\n- frame view -> without frame\n- without frame -> original 8x8px size\n- original 8x8px size -> frame view\n\nPress 's' to save an svg from current view.\n\nNotes:\n- Build with ReactJs and TweenJs\n- Every upcoming day, half of the remaining pieces are burned.\n\nHappy Birthday fxhash community!\nI'm glad to be among you!",

            "description": "After 4 months of coding the Generative Glasses is ready! I gained a lot of experience along the way and I really liked the creation process.\n\nI wrote an article in which I report on the creation process in more detail. It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\nüëì thousands of different outputs are possible\nüë®‚Äçüíª only code\nüé® 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \nüé• animated\nüñ±Ô∏è interactive (+controls for mobile)\nüòé augmented reality view\nüü• different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\nüñºÔ∏è save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\nüìº save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress ‚Äú5‚Äù to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú6‚Äù to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú7‚Äù to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú8‚Äù to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress ‚ÄúArrowDown‚Äù for restores the original camera view\nPress ‚ÄúD‚Äù to switch to next composition\nPress ‚ÄúA‚Äù to switch  to previous composition\nPress ‚ÄúS‚Äù to start animation\nPress ‚ÄúSpacebar‚Äù to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú1‚Äù to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú2‚Äù to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú3‚Äù to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention! Thanks for the support! Thanks for the opportunity fxhash and genart community! I hope I was able to contribute to generative art with my work!\n\n@C4RC0\ncarco.hu",

            "description": "A 10k Generative Profile Pic collection\nGEN XYZ Das Occult - by culla - @tamccullough\n\nmove over cryptopunks\nthere is a new group on the scene\n\n100% code - not an image composition\n\nA bunch of common palettes\nA selection of rare palettes\nAnd a smaller set of ultra rare palettes\nHowever, rarity will be based on what combinations the code produces\n\nThe majority of tokens will not have a special trait\nHowever your token might have one or even multiple special traits\nBut, be aware that only the last special trait added will be listed in the features\n\nEven then, look closely, because not all aspects of the canvas are included in the features. Collectors should still look closely and choose what they like when buying on secondary.\n\nWhich team are you on? X or O?\n\nfollow culla on twitter for updates. Or maybe __acolyte__\n\nIf the non reserved tokens mint out quickly, Access List mints will have 24 hours to mint reserves assigned to those wallets\n\nThank you for supporting an emerging artist in the generative art space\n\nAccess List reserves were given to holders of the following PFP collections created by culla\n2x for each Basqunk held\n1x for each Inkspunk, TwoFourQunk, V0iD, DeeManz, Punkasso and CR0$$KULL\nYou would have needed to transfer the above tokens to your mint wallet at the time of the snapshot\n\nshare your tokens on social media with #genxyznft\nMade with love by culla using p5.js",
