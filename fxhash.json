How many iterations, and the speed and size of the added parts determines the final composition. \n\nYou can stop the iterations by pressing S, and download the current composition by hitting D, and restart/reload the iterations by pressing R.\n\nNotes\nThe thumbnail generation takes a while and the render/iterations in non-GPU browser can be quite slow.

            "description": "Inner Chaos is about my personal struggles with anxiety and fear. Through this artwork, I attempt to visually represent the complex and often overwhelming emotions that I experience on a daily basis. It is a reflection of the cyclical nature of my thoughts and feelings, and the ways in which I try to make sense of them. But as I delve deeper into my own personal experiences, I realize that in the end, internal chaos should not be controlled, but accepted.\n\nThis artwork is my most personal, as it reflects my innermost sensations. It is a reminder to myself and to others that it is okay to not have everything under control, and that it is important to allow the uncertainty and unpredictability of life. I hope that it will resonate with others and provide a sense of connection and understanding. It is a reminder that we are not alone in our struggles and that it is important to embrace our own imperfections.\n\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience. Chrome is highly recommended for high res saving.\n\nMade with love and p5js.\n\n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG 1200 x 1800\n[2] - save PNG 2400 x 3600\n[3] - save PNG 4800 x 7200\n[4] - save PNG 7200 x 10800\n\nOn mobile:\n[quick tap] - save PNG",
