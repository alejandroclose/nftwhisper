            "description": "ASCII-SCAPE\n\nLike for many others growing up during the 1980s & 90s, my very first hands-on encounter with actual computer graphics (outside of games) was in the form of \"textmode\" and its various alphanumeric characters and other symbols available on the 8bit home computers of that period. These machines were perfectly capable of producing fairly high-resolution & multi-color graphics (all relative), yet most systems booted into an interactive prompt with the so-called textmode as de-facto standard environment, providing a level, if also limited, playing field for the creation of text-based graphics from a patchwork of characters & symbols of a predefined font (system or custom). As is so often the case, limitation is the mother of invention and the regular, monospaced grid and standardized set of characters quickly encouraged an entire subculture of specialized designers & artists to emerge (which is currently being re-discovered & remixed by younger generations), applying & showcasing their creativity (with often surprisingly ingenious skills) in the form of game designs, user interfaces, disk mags, demoscene productions, competitions, flyers, BBSes and even various early Web designs of the mid/late 90s.\n\nASCII-SCAPE is an attempted non-nostalgic homage to these roots & culture. It is also a textmode-only (no canvas!) rework of my previous piece C-SCAPE. It combines my love of cellular automata with the stripped back aesthetics & limitations of using only text as representation medium of these co-evolving generative systems. It required an almost complete rewrite & re-curation of various elements: 1200+ new handpicked rule combinations, 32 character sets, 40 color themes, new relationships & biases to better manage the resulting textures, densities and contrast.\n\nAlthough technically not strictly \"ASCII\" (an actual standard, but also a popular shorthand for \"text only\"), the entire simulation only uses various Unicode characters and the beautiful Iosevka open source typeface by Renzhi Li aka Belleve Invis.\n\nLike its parent C-SCAPE, this project is dynamic and evolves indefinitely. It's best viewed on non-mobile devices, where there's a decent horizontal resolution to provide sufficient simulation space. Please see the C-SCAPE project description for further details. There's no graphical export feature, but output can be captured into an UTF-8 plain text file (max. 100k lines/generations).\n\nThe following keyboard shortcuts are available:\n\n- space : toggle simulation updates (pause/play)\n- r : randomize environment\n- x : start/stop recording\n- f : toggle scroll speed (fast/slow)\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nIosevka typeface licensed under OFL-1.1 license\n\nhttps://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and https://thi.ng",

            "description": "This project involves the rendering of a three-dimensional Iterated Function System (IFS) using volumetric raymarching techniques. When projected onto a two-dimensional canvas, it generates a series of intricate patterns reminiscent of abstract paintings. \n\nThe main parameter is the seed, which the shader uses to calculate internal hashes in the GLSL code, resulting in a variety of patterns. Up to four layers of each fractal can be stacked, and the rotation of coordinates for each layer can be controlled. \n\nOther adjustable features include stroke intensity, color saturation, an inverted color mode, and a texture composed of lines that distort the patterns. The frequency and distortion factor of the lines can be adjusted as well.\n\nRendering can be slow on low-end GPUs, and it's not suitable for mobile devices.",

            "description": "Illustrations from The Collection of Most Beautiful Fairy Tales I had and puzzles with a painting by Ivan Rabuzin owned by one of my friends are deeply embedded in my childhood memory as images I was enchanted by and wished I knew how to make. Recently, searching for both items in antique stores, it turned out the illustrations, although still beautiful, aren't the same as I remember them. Rabuzin's oeuvre is rich and is a direct inspiration for this project, but I failed to find any evidence those puzzles ever existed and possibly are the product of my imagination. \n\nThe same case is with fairy tales and their true and \"untrue\" nature. A hero embarks on a journey where various events unfold in seemingly random or loosely connected ways. The occurrences sometimes lead to improbable plot twists, but these enigmatic transformations ultimately bring the story full circle, evoking a sense of familiarity combined with an air of mystery.\n\nOn this Enchanted journey, you might end up in one of five possible scenes: Fairy Lake, Magic Wetlands, Giant's Woods, Over 7 Seas and 7 Mountains, or Enchanted Forest. Look out for the FOMO keyboard key to visit more locations.\n\nUse [s] key in live view to save output as PNG. \n\n----\nEnchanted was part of the Blind Gallery x Feral File Vistas Edition.\nLearn more at https://www.blindgallery.xyz/ ",

            "description": "Dancing bubbles is a mesmerizing form of visual art that captures bubble beauty and fluidity. It involves creating intricate and vibrant designs using bubbles as generative art.\nThe process begins by mixing a special solution that creates long-lasting and colorful bubbles. I carefully blew these bubbles onto the canvas and let them float and move freely. As the bubbles interact with each other, they create stunning patterns and shapes.\nI manipulated the direction, colors, and movement of the bubbles using live patterns and directed them across the canvas to create dynamic compositions.\nWhen the bubbles merge, they leave a vibrant trail, creating unique textures and patterns on the canvas. The result is a captivating work of art that comes alive with its own fluidity and movement.\nDancing bubbles are visually appealing, but they also evoke joy and playfulness. It captures the fleeting nature of bubbles and reminds us to appreciate beautiful moments that are fleeting yet magical.\nThis art form can be enjoyed in various settings, including galleries, exhibitions, or even live performances in aquariums decorated with colored lights. It's a delightful experience for me and viewers alike, as we watch the creation of ephemeral catches of bubbles that dance before our eyes.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\nAll That Could Be is about the inner life of pitch drops waiting for their inevitable fall.\n\nAfter first learning of the pitch drop experiment and understanding what this odd hyper-viscous liquid was… all I could think about was: How does the pitch feel about all of this? What does it dream of? How does it deal with this intense pressure to snap, drip and perform?\n\nAll That Could Be acts as a metaphysical microscope into the emotional state of the pitch. The anticipated explosion of energy and pain when it loses its battle with gravity… as well as daydreams imagined to brighten its dark, slow existence with vibrant, static-y layers… or fantasies of being anywhere else besides trapped in a funnel under a locked encasement for the entertainment/curiosity of others who just hope to see you snap into two.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://hereandnow.events/\n\nProcure a coin to participate in the event:\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/here-and-now:-edition-5\n\n————\n\nSome key commands in live mode:\n\nG : Toggle grain\nA : Toggle aura\nS : Save current resolution\n1 : 3000x3750\n2 : 4500x5625\n3 : 6000x7500\n4 : 7500x9375\n5 : 9000x11250\n6 : 10500x13125\n(1-6 work best on Chrome/Edge)\n(rendering takes longer as resolution increases)",

Many thousands per mint? Millions per project? Billions in total? Shall we add just a few more to celebrate the end of the genesis? Here are 222 iterations with 111 lines each. Each line connects two edges of the canvas but may get deflected by hidden attractors in an attempt to minimize friction and deviation from its path.\n\nPress [p]rint to save a high resolution capture.\n\nThis artwork is fully generative and was entirely hand-coded in 4,400 characters of plain JavaScript. Forever limited to 222 editions on the Tezos blockchain. I hope you will enjoy yours. London, March 2022.",
