            "description": "This is an album of cities too ideal to ever materialise.\n\nIt consists of 256 algorithmically generated plans that resemble drawings of Vincenzo Scamozzi, Pietro Cataneo, Filarete and other theorists of the Italian Renaissance. The cities differ in size, the grid of the streets, the landscape around them and the people that inhabit their utopian walls. They carry names that are Italian exonyms of real European cities, drawing a vision of a different world that enacts a mixture of military perfection with social superiority. Flawless, harmonious, unconquerable and utterly impossible.\n\nHistory brought us many theories about ideal cities, but very few examples exist today. Italian Palmanova or Polish Zamość are the few to remind us how hard it is to shape reality according to ideals. When confronted with the material world, its idealism becomes the city's grates foe.\n\nTo zoom, press a mouse button over the image or touch the screen.

I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

Note, this effects performance.\n * Reset the Kinetic by by tapping backspace.\n\nKinetics is a neo-constructivist generative art project built using p5js. Each Kinetic delicately moves from it's origin, giving the appearance of infinite space and possibility. The viewer witnesses the construction of the Kinetic floating inside of the negative. Shapes and lines move around the Kinetic in a dazzling display of contrasting color.\n\nThe texture developed for Kinetics, deemed The Creation of the Universe (See top right) is at its core a color gradient of 3 different colors. Each piece construct's itself, drawing lines on top of lines to create a unique self contained assembly of materials as opposed to a realistic abstraction. The Creation of the Universe repeats itself in each piece, just as cells do in an organic structure. From here is where it initially got it's name.\n\nInspired heavily by the works of Rodchenko and Tatlin, each Kinetic appears to slot together like a puzzle. Each piece has multiple hard edge planes clashing aggressively with each other giving the sense that there is more than just a flat canvas. A quasi realism is created through our desire to build instead of simply paint.\n\n\"Long Live Generative Art\"\n\n- Mitchell",
