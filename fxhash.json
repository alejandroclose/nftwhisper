Differing opacity, blend modes, and pixel skipping were used to create some interesting textures.\n\nIn my testing, many of the renders, especially the more earth-tone ones, reminded me of art used in fast food restaurants in the 90s when I was growing up.\n\nFeatures:\nFour different sizes: 9x16, 11x14\", 12x18\", 12x12\"\nPortrait or landscape orientation\n~500 color pallets, one black and white, one CMYK, one RGB, and the rest from Jam3/nice-color-palettes.\n\nDependencies:\nprocessing/p5.js\nlodash/lodash\nJam3/nice-color-palettes\n\nExport to a PNG format at several different sizes.\n- Press s: save the current render size\n- Press t: scale to screen size\n- Press f: full print size (see features for dimensions)\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\nPlease find me on Twitter and Instagram at @natenolting.\n",

            "description": "This idea was born from recent discussion on generative art and the path the medium is finding for itself. The project aims to take aesthetic concepts from sci fi graphic novels and blend them with generative systems of abstraction. \n\nThe debate is between using previously established art forms to influence this new medium, or using a new medium to meticulously reproduce a previous medium. I believe there’s room to explore the full spectrum, and I am attempting to find the midpoint that fits my work and brings me the most happiness.\n\nThe title describes the eventual aesthetic objective, which is to create a piece which might look like a splash page a colorist alone has been given the freedom to design and explore their own specialty. It explores centralized polar compositions, vibrant colors, plus lots and lots of movement. 60# paper is a standard weight for printing of comic books and graphic novels.\n\nPress ’s’ in live view to save a .png\n\nCreated with p5.js and chroma.js\n",

Differing opacity, blend modes, and pixel skipping were used to create some interesting textures.\n\nIn my testing, many of the renders, especially the more earth-tone ones, reminded me of art used in fast food restaurants in the 90s when I was growing up.\n\nFeatures:\nFour different sizes: 9x16, 11x14\", 12x18\", 12x12\"\nPortrait or landscape orientation\n~500 color pallets, one black and white, one CMYK, one RGB, and the rest from Jam3/nice-color-palettes.\n\nDependencies:\nprocessing/p5.js\nlodash/lodash\nJam3/nice-color-palettes\n\nExport to a PNG format at several different sizes.\n- Press s: save the current render size\n- Press t: scale to screen size\n- Press f: full print size (see features for dimensions)\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\nPlease find me on Twitter and Instagram at @natenolting.\n",

Technically that makes this an Image composition, but the images are never shown on the canvas.\n\nI played around with different ways the circles could be overlapped. Differing opacity, blend modes, and pixel skipping were used to create some interesting textures.\n\nIn my testing, many of the renders, especially the more earth-tone ones, reminded me of art used in fast food restaurants in the 90s when I was growing up.\n\nFeatures:\nFour different sizes: 9x16, 11x14\", 12x18\", 12x12\"\nPortrait or landscape orientation\n~500 color pallets, one black and white, one CMYK, one RGB, and the rest from Jam3/nice-color-palettes.\n\nDependencies:\nprocessing/p5.js\nlodash/lodash\nJam3/nice-color-palettes\n\nExport to a PNG format at several different sizes.\n- Press s: save the current render size\n- Press t: scale to screen size\n- Press f: full print size (see features for dimensions)\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\nPlease find me on Twitter and Instagram at @natenolting.\n",
