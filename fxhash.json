            "description": "🔥 BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY \"open edition\" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",

It involves drawing intricate designs, typically on the floor, using materials such as colored powders, flowers, and grains. \n\nRangoli is meant to bring prosperity and happiness to a home and can range from simple geometric patterns to more complex depictions of nature.\n\nThe Rangxel tesseracts are created through rule-based instructions, following traditional Rangoli formation principles like symmetry, repeating patterns, and themes, resulting in interconnected, multi-dimensional forms of fragments.\n\nThese monolithic structures also reflect natural 3D grids found in nature such as crystals and honeycombs,presenting a deconstructed, pixelated matrix of our universe. \n\nUltimately, the reality we live in is an abstraction of the algorithm narrated by the creator.\n\n#StayPixelated\n\nControls (){\nDouble click Once to Enable Rotate around Tesseract;\nDouble click Twice to Disable  Rotate;\nDouble click Thrice to Go back original Composition;\nRotate , Zoom , Pan with Touch/Mouse;\n}\n",

I listened, and in the noise of the leaves and seeds in the wind, I truly recognized their languages and voices. I was so overwhelmed by the depth and diversity of the world and the creatures that inhabit it, that it is still one of my most vivid memories. \n\nWhen I walk through parks or forests, I always listen to what they say. It is unlikely that I will ever be able to engage in their dialogue, but it is always like a touch of the magical immensity of life.\n\nWild Palms is the name of a gallery of our friends with whom it is always a pleasure to talk in the language of humans, and they have a garden right in the gallery.\nIn the project we mix childhood memories and friendship, the aesthetics of woodcuts, Polaroid and hand-printed photos with echoes of the digital voice of our present.\n\nThanks to YulikolaY for getting the code ready for production.\n\nMade with love, AI and p5.js code\n\nJanuary, 2023",

However, that seems insignificant to the accelerating infrastructural systems covering our planet inch by inch with every passing year. Growth and scale, two buzzwords of the modern economic machinery, driven by a yearning for a utopic society, although we move closer to a dystopic one. \n\nThis piece, started from a single petal, which is a certain section of the parametric surface, pillow, instanced over and over to create a single flower, instanced over and over to create multiple flowers, along with the help of l systems to create the base and the entire composition fed to a deformer to create distortion. A reminder that there are more things to life than being mere rats in the assembly line producing elements to develop the accidental megastructure.\n\n-----------\n\nPress 'S' in Live view to save PNG\n*Might take a while to load, please be patient!

All donation will sent from atimtay.eth and will be shared publicly from my twitter account\n\n\nArtwork info:\n\nAftershock is based on \"Metropolix IX' algorithm. In Metropolis the parameter space was constrained and the cells were painted in a fashion which would create city silhouettes. In Aftershock i removed the constraints and changed the all rulesets and palettes which would give us chaos maybe you can call it a collapsed city.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\n6 color palettes and 1 monochrome \n3 subdivison levels 2,3,4 \n2 aspect ratios \n10 divison styles \nand some other hidden randomized parameters which doesn't appear on the features but effecting overall outcome\n\nPress 1 to 8 to export PNG at increasing resolution\n\nMurat Atimtay 2023 www.atimtay.xyz",

It’s less of a technical discussion, and more about the experience of the artist, and how it became linked with the feelings they associate with the art.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nFor higher resolutions, you can append “&density=2” to the url to double the size, “&density=3” to triple, and so on.\n(This is highly recommended.)\n\nTo adjust grain, you can append “&grain=##” to the url. 40 is the default, and 0 will remove it completely.",
