            "description": "In 1934, German philosopher Max Bense published his first work “Raum und Ich” (Space & Ego) where he explored the concept of ‘information aesthetics’, proposing that the aesthetic value of an artwork could be derived from its underlying informational structure. \n\nBense asserted that \"Space\" extends beyond physical dimensions into the realm of abstract ideas, mathematical possibilities, and the unseen information shaping an artwork, while acknowledging its potential, boundaries, and prospects.\n\nThe term \"ego,\" usually associated with an artist's subjective impulses and emotional idiosyncrasies, is redefined in Bense's framework. As technology and information theory become integrated into artistic creation, the artist's role changes from a subjective creator to an architect of information and systems.\n\nThirty years later Manfred Mohr, an abstract expressionist, discovered Bense's information aesthetics in early 60’s, and his artistic thinking changed radically. Within a few years, his art transformed to computer generated algorithmic geometry. A pioneer of generative art, Mohr relentlessly explored precise geometric forms, symmetry, and a mathematical approach to art. \n\nWhile Bense’s work continues to provide a philosophical foundation and conceptual framework for generative art, Mohr demonstrated the power of computational processes to produce intellectually engaging artworks. The series 'Space & Ego' pays homage to both Bense and Mohr while initiating a dialogue. \n\nRooted in Mohr's concept of a random point within a square, this series broadens the \"space\" made possible by evolution of generative art. While the plotters of the 1960s were confined to monochromatic outputs, I have experimented with palettes uncommon in plotter projects. My choice of colors was expressive and more in tradition with abstract expressionists of 1960s. \n\nA random point is selected within a square, and the four resulting polygons are filled with lines. The probability of these polygons being filled with lines follows four approaches, ascending and descending from top-left to bottom-right (and vice versa), and radial expansion outward (and vice versa).

            "description": "Title: Urban trajectories\n\nit's a generative work that combines the precision and rigidity of a technical project with the expressiveness and creativity of informal abstract art. Made on graph paper highlighting the technical nature of the basic design. The grid creates mathematical order and clear structure, providing a stable foundation for artistic exploration.\n\nWithin some of the squares, the shapes intertwine and overlap, giving life to the geometric vision. Triangles stand out in different directions, some dotted with circles of various diameters, while rectangles of different sizes make up intriguing compositions. The colors used are black/white and a random colour, which catch the eye and create a lively contrast.\n\nthe work challenges the viewer to perceive art even in fields usually related to mathematics and engineering. The work invites reflection on the nature of order and creativity, showing how structure and artistic freedom can coexist in harmony. the work celebrates the beauty of geometric shapes and their versatility, demonstrating that even a technical foundation can be the starting point for a unique aesthetic experience.\n\n100% code - p5.js\n\nPress left mouse button to choose density from 1 to 15 (9000x12000) (wrong results set to 1)\n\nKenzo da barra",
