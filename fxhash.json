            "description": "“Winesburg, Ohio” is an act of uncanny place-making. The collection borrows its name from a 1919 short-story cycle by Sherwood Anderson, which explores a peculiar cast of characters living within a fictionalized, midwestern town. Like Anderson’s text, the “Winesburg, Ohio” algorithm constructs a world through recurring portrayals of specific structures and landmarks. Its scenes are populated by a variety of familiar elements taken from my larger body of work, including water towers, houses, and churches. Meanwhile, a series of scripted gestures insert abstract compositional elements into the outputs, counteracting their pictorial legibility. The strange landscapes that result are composite ideograms, comprised of multiple spatial possibilities that co-exist in varying states of contradiction.",

Rather born from the precise choreography of code—a generative artwork that speaks the language of disaster\n\nHere within this scene the chaos of creation is depicted in a symphony of pixels. It defies boundaries allowing an array of colors to blend together in an anarchy. Realitys edges blur as organic textures emerge from emptiness—a testament to the beauty found within generative processes.\n\nEach observer may perceive vistas feel textures and hear unique melodies.\nThis conversation, between the artwork and its observer is, like a dialogue expressed through the language of unpredictability.",

The collection borrows its name from a 1919 short-story cycle by Sherwood Anderson, which explores a peculiar cast of characters living within a fictionalized, midwestern town. Like Anderson’s text, the “Winesburg, Ohio” algorithm constructs a world through recurring portrayals of specific structures and landmarks. Its scenes are populated by a variety of familiar elements taken from my larger body of work, including water towers, houses, and churches. Meanwhile, a series of scripted gestures insert abstract compositional elements into the outputs, counteracting their pictorial legibility. The strange landscapes that result are composite ideograms, comprised of multiple spatial possibilities that co-exist in varying states of contradiction.",
