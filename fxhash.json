From wild animals velvety coats to the comfort of plush blankets and pillows, fur has a special quality that evokes warm and cozy feelings.\n\nFor many people, the touch of soft fur on their skin brings back memories of the safety and security of home. This sense of comfort can be especially powerful, providing a refuge from the turmoil and unpredictability of the outside world.\n\nWhether it is the shimmering pile of a top-quality carpet, the fluffiness of a cherished pet, or the stiff and rough fur of a bristly shepherd dog, the texture and appearance of fur is truly mesmerizing.

In architecture, I diversified forms inspired by textured stone Mayan pyramids and enriched the world of emotions with a wide color palette. While depicting nature, I paid attention to realism, but I also wanted it to have a slightly Fauvist style. Although the colors of nature are generally recognizable, atmospheric and seasonal conditions allow us to witness the entire spectrum of colors in nature. In my collections, I have emphasized the inclusion of animation and interactivity. In this artwork as well, I have worked on atmospheric phenomena to make it animated. Particularly, I find the unsettling feeling and the melancholic impact of simulating a storm fascinating, which is why I chose to incorporate it.\n\n*Start and stop animation: press ‘A’\n*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as png.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n*15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.",

            "description": "\"Pixel Grid\" is an experiment that explores #fxparams and revolves around co-creation. The algorithm generates a unique token for you with your minter address, while the transaction hash determines the resolution of the pixel grids that get inserted into the irregular base grid.\n\nUsing #fxparams, you can interact with the composition and modify 13 parameters such as the aspect ratio, color palettes, color pairs within the pixels, and the number of elements horizontally and vertically (referred to as \"Input X\" and \"Input Y\"). Additionally, you can define coverage or manipulate the perception of depth by specifying the offset displacement of the pixels using \"Pixel X\" and \"Pixel Y.\"\n\nEven after minting, you can continue to play and modify your token. Clicking on the canvas changes colors within the selected color pairs for each row. Pressing the \"c\" key toggles between the defined color pairs or random assignment within the chosen palette. Pressing \"v\" key allows you to hide/show the pixels, while \"b\" and \"n\" keys can toggle both types of lines in this generative composition.\n",

            "description": "A response to being buffeted by forces outside of our control. Platonics sought to find order, control and solace in the Platonic solids. Instead it found beauty and intrigue in the emergent chaos that can arise from even the simplest systems.\n\nIts building blocks are the five Platonic solids. Forms which have fascinated humanity for thousands of years. Their title comes from the philosophy of Plato, who equated each of the solids with a classical element.\n\nPlatonics arranges these forms in a series of geometric layouts, with varying density and randomness. At one extreme we see tidy radial circles consisting of a single solid. At the other, packed pentagons consisting of jumbled solids give rise to Escher-esque compositions which hold near infinite variety, variety enhanced by a range of pens and colours that draw and fill those solids.\n\nThis relationship between order and disorder is at the heart of Platonics. The collection seeks to show how they are not so far removed from one another – and how we might embrace them both. It also aims to give collectors a behind the scenes look at how generative compositions can be constructed.\n\nThe geometric proof that there are only five convex regular polyhedra (the Platonic solids) states that at each vertex of the solid the angles between adjacent sides must be less than 360 degrees. This amount less than 360 degrees is known as the defect angle.\n\nIt is from this geometric proof that the collection size and pricing for Platonics is derived. There will be 360 Platonics sold via a Dutch auction priced according to the defect angles of the five Platonic solids: 180 > 120 > 90 > 60 > 36.\n\nhttps://www.phaust.art/platonics\n\n----------\n\nCompetition: Submit your favourite previews via Twitter to win a free mint and print.\n\nPrints: Free gallery-grade, signed A3 prints for the first 18 mints.\n\nLive: Press ‘S’ to save in hi-res or append '&size=#' to the URL for custom height.\n\nInfo: Original artwork by Phaust.

            "description": "Power Ranges is an artistic endeavor born not from a concept, but from the pure spirit of experimentation. While I could attempt to uncover a profound narrative or significance behind this project, the truth of the matter is that Power Ranges is, in essence, just a form of digital doodling with code. A testament to the beauty of unbridled exploration in the realm of art, where discovery and wonder sometimes take precedence over any predetermined purpose.\n\nIn this project, I have harnessed the power of height maps and ranges to create an intriguing visual experience. The origin was the implementation of the marching squares algorithm that I had never used before. From there I started to play with height maps, mixing noise and custom shapes. Finally, I wrote a parser for the map in order to generate the isolines that are then drawn using my beloved Superline script.\n\nI hope you’ll like the outputs as much as I did while testing the algorithm. Some of them can be truly cute.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ”s” to save the current output.\n\nPressing the keys “1”, “2” or “3” the artwork will regenerate at a different scale.\n\nThe “size” parameter can also be passed via URL with the values “s”, “m” or “l” to initialize the generator with the desired size.\n\n=======================================\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\nPowered by p5 and chroma.\n",

In architecture, I diversified forms inspired by textured stone Mayan pyramids and enriched the world of emotions with a wide color palette. While depicting nature, I paid attention to realism, but I also wanted it to have a slightly Fauvist style. Although the colors of nature are generally recognizable, atmospheric and seasonal conditions allow us to witness the entire spectrum of colors in nature. In my collections, I have emphasized the inclusion of animation and interactivity. In this artwork as well, I have worked on atmospheric phenomena to make it animated. Particularly, I find the unsettling feeling and the melancholic impact of simulating a storm fascinating, which is why I chose to incorporate it.\n\n*Start and stop animation: press ‘A’\n*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as png.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n*15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.",

In architecture, I diversified forms inspired by textured stone Mayan pyramids and enriched the world of emotions with a wide color palette. While depicting nature, I paid attention to realism, but I also wanted it to have a slightly Fauvist style. Although the colors of nature are generally recognizable, atmospheric and seasonal conditions allow us to witness the entire spectrum of colors in nature. In my collections, I have emphasized the inclusion of animation and interactivity. In this artwork as well, I have worked on atmospheric phenomena to make it animated. Particularly, I find the unsettling feeling and the melancholic impact of simulating a storm fascinating, which is why I chose to incorporate it.\n\n*Start and stop animation: press ‘A’\n*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as png.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n*15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.",

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px). It may last for high numbers.\nWe recommend the use of Chrome browser in order to render properly the texture.\n\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 × 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.net",
