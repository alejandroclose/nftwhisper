            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

            "description": "White Mountain Winter is collaboration between myself and the machine to describe scenes that are real, or were. Yet perhaps now foreign, or out of time, or far away. I provide the seed of a dream I remember, and trust the machine to help make it real again.\n\nI grew up in a town much like some of these, homes dispersed throughout the valley beneath the shadows of the mountains rising around. This is a tribute to the memory of wintertime in that place; bleak, cold, grey, with the light seemingly always fading. Yet at the same time, the feeling of calm, solace, peace resonating through. Exposed to the mountain elements, yet protected by them. A delicate arrangement, but essential.\n\nThe seed of magic I remember is present in the experience of falling snow at dusk. Large flakes tumbling down and blanketing everything, no end in sight. The most striking thing is the silence. The fallen snow absorbing all distraction, insisting that your focus be sharpened to a singularity; right there, right then.\n\n---\n- Best rendered in Chrome browser (best performance, & canvas blur - please be patient :)\n- Made with p5js\n- Press \"s\" to save png",

            "description": "This project is borne out of my longstanding fascination with brushwork, and the intricate textures that can be created with a brush, some paint and a canvas. Brush strokes are simulated using many overlapping lines and given texture and depth using a custom shader. Another important aspect of this work, is the composite forms that are created by the brush strokes, which are my attempt to emulate the emphatic energy of many abstract painters that have come before me. Color palettes are named after common paint colors, based on the background color used for the palette.\n\nThose who collect during the first tier of the Dutch Auction can claim a signed print. They will be printed on A3 Hahnemuhle Photo Rag, and shipped to the collector free of charge. More details on how to claim a print and specify the necessary shipping information will be provided via the artists twitter (@landlinesart1).\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG.

            "description": "This project was started in December 2021. At that time, I didn't know what the result would be. It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

            "description": "In march of this year, I started working on a new series involving multi-layering, and overriding shapes. Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",
