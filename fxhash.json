            "description": "This is the second in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nThis work is a mark of progress. Christopher Scussel and I are working on modernizing MINI-EXPLOR. Chris is working on updating the engine from the original FORTRAN code of the 1970’s and its other limitations to usable JavaScript. In concert, I am analyzing and synthesizing the capabilities of the code and identifying an aesthetic. Together we continue to update EXPLOR and add new features.\n\nCPoSOP Composition is an original derivative work of Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids that was one of Knowlton’s original test examples. (Example 3)\n\nThe original EXPLOR picture frame was limited to a fixed array of 140 x 140 “characters.” Chris has rewritten the code to make the picture space variable. In this piece I increased the image space to a resolution 250 x 250  picture cells. Each picture cell is a 3x3 pixel block. \n\nThe EXPLOR functions are designed to interact with the current contents of each cell in the picture array. Every EXPLOR function has a rules parameter. In this test I’ve added a background. Thus when I draw my modified CPoSOP widget over the background it interacts with the color contents of a background cell or, the color of the cell based on a previously drawn widget.\n\nI’ve modified the original CPoSOP code and replaced constants with random variables. (made it a Spatial Force). I create a regular grid (Form of Spatial Organization) of a random size and draw the CPoSOP widget 85% of the time in one of the grid elements positions. The grid provides a structure to the image and the CPoSOP widget provides visual interest. The interaction of the widgets with the background and each other are amazing. \n\nIn keeping true to an EXPLOR vibe we use 4 color palettes. We let the computer randomly pick from three predefined palettes: Black and white. Four colors randomly chosen from set of 8 “Bauhaus” colors. And, four truly random colors.\n\nWe continue to honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT series. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored now updated by Scussel and Kolomyjec. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history with a modern twist.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

No matter the age, situation, location, success of any individual, from time to time, each one of us undergoes bouts of uncertainty. Chaos is something that is often portrayed in a negative light, but every once in a while it can end up being something beautiful as well. For example a nice surprise in an otherwise hectic day! \n\nThis generative token is a celebration of chaos, a ray of hope amidst the tumultuous times that we live in, an escape from our internal vulnerabilities, a sense of closure and acceptance even when a lot might be going on in our lives. \n\nFeel free to mint as many as you want, gift it to your friends or loved ones, sell it, resell it or even make derivatives of your particular mint. I put in a reserve list for everybody who has collected any of my NFTs in the past so that my supporters don't miss out! This token is an expression of my gratitude to my supporters, and the entire FxHash community. Thank you all! \nKeep making art. No matter how hard today might be, be hopeful for a better tomorrow. \n\nMade with love in cables.gl",
