            "description": "Tapawingo employs a fundamental structure, essentially an isometric grid, which is constructed row by row and simultaneously rotated around a specific point. Remarkably, such a simple configuration can yield incredibly diverse, abstract results that are unique in their variation.\n\nThe resultant outputs can undergo radical changes in the final moments, frequently leading to entirely unanticipated end products. A significant level of randomness, coupled with a multitude of variables, have been seamlessly incorporated into this project, all within a remarkably straightforward framework. This truly empowers the algorithm to generate creations beyond our wildest imaginations. The code contains minimal curation, which occasionally leads to less-than-ideal outcomes. For instance, at times, the color scheme and rotation might converge in a way that leaves the canvas predominantly empty. Although this is an infrequent occurrence, it can happen.\n\nThe blocks' visual portrayal can be mentally challenging, as discerning their orientation can be tricky. It often necessitates viewing the sketch being drawn to reconcile the correct perspective.\n\nTapawingo's creations are fully responsive and are designed to display exceptionally well on high-resolution screens or when printed in large formats. The renderings adjust to the smaller dimension of your display's height or width while maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio. For greater control over the size, you can specify dimensions using URL parameters, the details of which are outlined below.\n\nThis is a free mint only because I don't want my feelings hurt. :)\n \n\nControls\n--------\n[mouse click] - start/stop the sketch\n[r] - redraw the sketch\n[s] - save a .png\n\nURL Params\n----------\n?size=xxxx where xxxx is a size in pixels you'd like to render\n\nFeatures Descriptions\n---------------------\nCell Size - the size of each cell in the grid\nColor Scheme - refers to the coloring of the left, right, top and outline for each block.\nBlock Spacing - the padding between the block and the borders of each cell.\nBlock Height Scheme - \"noisy\" blocks get their height from random noise that is smoothed using the Noise Smoothing variable and \"linear\" blocks get their height as a function of the distance from a randomly chosen block.\nMaximum Height & Amplitude - these control the height of the blocks and the disparity between those heights.\nStroke Weight - the thickness of the outlines for each block.\nRotation Type - \"noisy\" rotation gets random rotation movement using Perlin noise that is smoothed with the Noise Smoothing variable and \"linear\" rotation is constant rotation that moves in a uniform manner.\nRotate Around Center - the rotation point can either be the center of the canvas or a randomly chosen point elsewhere on the canvas.\nNoise Smoothing - used to determine how smooth or ruggedly noise driven elements of the sketch are rendered.\nSuper Blocks - with a nod to Fidenzas, this determines whether the blocks are broken up into individual blocks or traditionally rendered as one block.",

I had discarded this idea until my friend said it looked like a waterfall of colors and he liked it, so I decided to mint it. After tweaking some parameters like colors and line thickness it produced some nice outputs.\n\nI hope you will enjoy it. Free mint(unless you cant wait and want to pay =) plus 25% royalties for minters.\n\nreserves for the collectors of my testnft on objkt, my friend CampendonkP and a few artists who I remembered who did free mints, like punevyr and JohnRising.",

            "description": "This experimental project involves an on-chain cellular automaton. The features and cellular automaton rules are derived from the minter's address. Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",

            "description": "This experimental project involves an on-chain cellular automaton. The features and cellular automaton rules are derived from the minter's address. Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",

            "description": "This experimental project involves an on-chain cellular automaton. The features and cellular automaton rules are derived from the minter's address. Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",
