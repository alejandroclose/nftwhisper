            "description": "‚ÄúFelix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas‚Äù\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state ‚Äì heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil‚Äôs quote from the beginning translates to: ‚ÄúFortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things‚Äù. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP üññ\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 ‚Äì 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom.

For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration.

They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others.

            "description": "This generator is named 'Ichigo' (Ëã∫/ „ÅÑ„Å°„Åî), the Japanese word for 'strawberry'. \n\nSeeing each iteration from a suitable distance, small dots (to me, reminiscent of strawberry seeds) overlay different sequences of geometric repetitions, implying a sense of texture, grittiness and irregularity. \n\nBy looking closer however, it becomes apparent to the viewer that the majority of the composition is in fact government by orderly elements, in this case grids of dots. \n\nThis discovery invites the viewer to consider the output in front of them at different levels, near and far. At what point do you feel the dots begin to dissolve into a texture? When do you stop noticing the dots and instead begin to perceive the overall composition?\n\nThese questions are posed in a similar fashion as with meditation; at what point does something become something else? When does an in-breath become an out-breath and vice versa? \n\nContemplation on simple questions like these can open a small portal into stillness and mindfulness by taking time to slowly observe our responses. \n\n23 palettes are included, each named after different areas of Tokyo. \n\nPress 'S' to download a full size 6000px x 6000px PNG output. \n\nAs always, much gratitude and enjoy your piece.

            "description": "'Sabler : Serengeti' is a special edition reissue of the original Sabler generator in a vibrant 'Serengeti' palette which was omitted from the original collection. \n\nTowards the end of the production of the original Sabler collection, the creative decision was made to reduce the number of palettes from the thirteen that had been created to a smaller number, in order to improve the cohesiveness of the collection overall. While 'Serengeti' remained one of the stronger palettes, it was ultimately excluded in favour of the 'Annaliese' palette, in homage to an Anni Albers tapestry that originally inspired the 'Sabler' collection. \n\nHere, the 'Serengeti' palette is provided as a companion piece to the original Sabler collection to give collectors the opportunity to pair their output with their existing collection if they choose.\n\nBelow follows an edited description for the original 'Sabler' collection:\n\n'Sabler', an anagram of 'Albers', is a generative homage to the work of the Bauhaus textile artist Anni Albers.\n\nThe aesthetic of this piece and its proportions are guided by the Golden Ratio (1.618 : 1) and as such, each part of the composition relates in some way to its larger self.\n\nAs lines playfully extend and overlap one another from various grid segments, patterns appear, 'ghost' shadings emerge and complexity is implied even with the use of very simple elements.\n\nThere are no rarities or special features, other than for you to enjoy the unique qualities of your piece!\n\nYou can save a high resolution 3000px x 3000px PNG of your edition by pressing the 'S' key.",

Link at the bottom. If you‚Äôd rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that‚Äôs present. \n\n../‚Äô`*‚Äô`\\../‚Äô`*‚Äô`\\../‚Äô`*‚Äô`\\../‚Äô`*‚Äô`\\../‚Äô`*‚Äô`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying ‚Äúdone‚Äù for 4 seconds when it‚Äôs ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won‚Äôt need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

            "description": "A mix of aesthetics from the Ukiyo-e and Shin-hanga woodblock movements, with modern elements.  \n\nukiyo-e (ÊµÆ‰∏ñÁµµ) = \"pictures of the floating world\", which peaked in the late 19th century. \nshin-hanga (Êñ∞ÁâàÁîª) = \"new prints\", from roughly the 1920-1950s. \n\nSome comparisons between the prints of the Japanese masters and gen-art: \n\n* The number of prints. Based on how well a piece was received, the publisher could decide to produce more copies, usually in batches of 200. Compare this to limiting the edition size on fx(hash). The initial prints would have sharp lines and accurately coloured areas. Very popular prints with thousands of impressions would slowly degrade the blocks, leaving final prints with worn-out linework and colours that weren't true to originals.  \n\n* Woodblock prints were actually a collab between the artist, the wood carver, and the printer. In many cases only the artist and publisher were recognized on the final prints. It was usually the publisher who owned the woodblock, not the artist. Often the artist was considered a worker, contracted at the request of the publisher or patrons funding the project. Compare this to the NFT space, where ownership is carved onto the blockchain, and artists have freedom to create whatever they wish. \n\n* Copyminters.... Similar to the NFT world, fake publishers sprang up from time to time, who would reproduce famous prints. Enji Takamizawa was one such counterfeiter, who was able to skilfully produce woodblocks replicating originals down to the wood grain! \n\n* While fine-quality woodblock prints from the Edo era command huge auction prices today, they were in reality affordable art for the regular people of their time. NFTs are similar in this light, where we can enjoy pieces at home rather than say, visiting galleries or museums of unattainable art. \n\n\n\nAdditional querystring params (use when viewing in a separate window) \n\n* fullsize=true (33 megapixel output) \n* colourcorrect=false \n* grain=false \n* border=false \n\n\n\nLicenses included in source. Relying on: \n\n* PIXIJS for drawing \n* JSTS for geometry functions \n* chromajs for colour functions \n* noise and gaussian helpers from p5js ",

OBSCVRVM, meaning ‚Äúdarkness‚Äù in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state ‚Äì heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil‚Äôs quote from the beginning translates to: ‚ÄúFortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things‚Äù. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP üññ\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 ‚Äì 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate.

They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others.
