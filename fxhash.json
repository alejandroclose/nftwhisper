            "description": "Snell's artifacts are imaginary geometric objects created using Snell's and Descartes' laws of optics that define the behavior of a ray of light passing from one transparent medium to another.\n\nBy applying these laws to extreme parameters, beyond what the real world is capable of producing and with a high level of variability, we open the door to a new world.\n\nIn order to keep some control over this extreme and crazy world, the grid within which the rays evolve is divided into several squares. Each of these squares limits the grid settings at that location.\n\nIn order to be able to generate a Snell Artifact, 1 to 6 million rays are created. It may take a while. So be patient while these radii are calculated.\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard commands:\n[S]: Saves a PNG image of 4000x4000 pixels without glow filter\n[SHIFT + S]: Saves a 4000x4000 pixel PNG image and applies a glow filter (may take a long time depending on your system)\n\nURL parameters:\nAdd the parameter size=N to generate an image of NxN pixels (glow effect will be disabled by default)\nAdd the parameter glow=true to apply a glow effect to the image\n\n\n\n\nArtist: Estienne\nJuly 2022",

Through years of growing in fluxed vapor, its knots and roots construct organized and rhythmic patterns within chaotic orders. From two-dimensional layouts to three-dimensional composition, “Magnolia” absorbs its fundamental image, and extend it even further — creating the core of generative artwork.\n\nPress \"s\" to download",

It has been very exciting for me to grow this project along with my learnings. I’ve spent 6 months building, adding, cutting, and tweaking.  All of this wrestling has left an embarrassingly mangled code base.  That said, I truly believe the diversity of the output-space is worth it.  \n\nDuring development, I encountered some very severe roadblocks, some of which I felt I might never be able to resolve.

It might take me just as long to complete and I expect that it will be a far smaller release, but I’ll still put just as much care into making sure I deliver a quality project for anyone willing to mint.\n\n\n============Open and Ugly============\nI won’t be obscuring my code.  Anyone is free to use browser dev tools to look and learn to their heart’s content.\n\nBe ye forewarned, though.  It’s not pretty.  I started out well enough, but little tweaks here and there to play and expand on the project has resulted in a code base I might be a little embarrassed about.\n\nBut, that’s OK!  We are all in this together and maybe this will be a way of helping others not feel intimidated by a sense of perfection.  I have also included fairly verbose comments, too, as added commentary to my insanity.\n\nI hope that my openness and vulnerability will be seen by everyone in the community as an invitation to connect with me for any reason.  If you'd like to ask me any questions about this project, about my collecting, about learning to code, about working through challenges, or whatever else...please don't hesitate to ping me in just about any of the fx(hash) related discords (Kaloh's, TENDER, fx(hash), clewcrew) or on twitter.  \n\n\n============Interactions============\n{F}eatures\n{P}rogress\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{N}oise Switch\n{1-3} Adjust Adherence\n{4-9} Save at x² resolution\n{I}nfinite Animation Modes - [Experimental] \n\nThere are two infinite animation modes.  I call them experimental because they didn't quite reach the level of polish that I would have preferred.  \n\nThe first mode is a loop-with-reverse.  It runs efficiently, but I think it's a little too obvious what it is doing.  It also messes with the background color.\n\nThe second mode is a more subtle loop that I actually love, but performance is VERY dependent on your device.  My M1 Mac runs it fairly well, but most other devices struggle through frames.  Even at a lower framerate, I think it's a neat effect.  Though, I wish I was able to figure out a way to improve the performance.

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

            "description": "Limina is a study of the fine line between order and chaos.\n\nEach piece of the collection is made up of just one or two lines. These lines are defined by thousands of points that are chosen, one by one, by a simple algorithm moving across the canvas. What arises from that simple concept is a surprising variety of intricate patterns, accidental symmetries and traces of order in chaotic structures. \n\nLimina is a meditation on the concept of emergence, a concept that lies at the heart of generative art. The algorithm that defines the core of the series is only capable of making one simple choice: left, right, up or down? As it moves across the canvas, it leaves a trace of points that are connected by a curve. The order in which these points are chosen and the tightness of the curve connecting them is what creates the visual diversity of Limina. As these values fluctuate, symmetries emerge and break down again, forms, patterns and ornaments are created and combined to form both complex structures and simple abstractions. \n\nLimina shows the potential of minimalist generative concepts to generate visually dense and unexpected results. \n\nPress 's' to save your image.\n",

It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "“Southern Gothic” is my debut release on the fxhash platform. The project is created entirely through code. All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n“Southern Gothic” borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",
