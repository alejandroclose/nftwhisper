We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "🎧 CLICK/TAP FOR SOUND ON\n\nSaṅkhāra is a portrait of symbolic consciousness in three movements.\n\nColorful automata represents direct experience: touch, sight, hearing, smell, taste and thought in a ceaseless flow of novelty.\n\nThe automata congeals into form alluding to the way our minds close over experience with symbolic representation, like a plastic bag coming down over a kaleidoscope of butterflies. What was free in the open air is now trapped. What was previously wild and unpredictable is now under control, frozen and communicable.\n\nThe form’s dispersal mimics the release of mental formation, the unbinding of a symbol, the letting go of a belief. It’s a visceral reflection of the process of ceasing to identify with separateness. To strain the previous metaphor, it’s the opening of the bag and letting the butterflies return to the flow of raw, boundless experience.\n\n—\n\nK.C. Austin\nFrom his cockpit in the Blue Ridge Mountains K.C. Austin (aka bzor) spends his days shaping realtime software art systems of all stripes. Informed by game design, modular synths, virtual reality and consciousness research, K.C. plays shaders like a fiddle and fashions creative pipelines like a spider spins webs.\n\nJames Paterson\nFascinated by the relationship between ancient and futuristic mediums, James Paterson has been exploring a unique synthesis of drawing, code, animation and sculpture under the moniker ‘Presstube’ since 1999. Paterson draws inspiration from meditation, molecular biology, music, parenting and psychedelics - the seen, the heard, the felt, the cognized.",

There are 17 figures that get combined and mixed over three layers. The figures vary in complexity but are generally created with vertical and horizontal lines only. Figures have at least one seed, some even have a seed per path. A seed is an oscillating pixel that can be compared to a square wave oscillator of audio synthesis and is usually followed by a path or a set of paths. The purpose of the paths is to send the pixels along the lines to make the figures visible through movement and to create a reduction to pure animation.\n\n👽 Kim Asendorf",

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. www.tribute-hwf.com\n\n\"Since the classical age of Greece, the golden ratio has been well known as the most balanced and therefore most aesthetically perfect proportion. In fact, it is supposedly often found in the fine arts and architecture and it is certainly important in geometry. But where is the proof that it is really the most beautiful proportion?\n\n\"The computer is proving to be a useful tool in exact art theory. Works of computer art are produced with the help of programs that describe the logic of the construction and its relevant measures. By varying the parameters you can vary the shapes of objects, and on the basis of the reaction of the public you can determine the best option. So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n\"A statistical evaluation would be interesting. Please email me with your results for the optimal proportion.\"\n\nI found it heartwarming that in 2011, Herbert W. Franke wrote the above, accompanied with a simple functional program on a Wolfram Demonstration page (https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/IsTheGoldenRatioReallyTheMostBeautifulProportion/) titled 'Is the Golden Ratio Really the Most Beautiful Proportion?' and invited people to submit their findings to him.\n\nThe main idea behind this project is ratios, a variety of them, used in a variety of ways, such as how a rectangle is repeatedly subdivided, or how it influences the aspect ratio of the piece, or how the colors in a palette are selected. These are represented in various styles, some of which are inspired by the aesthetic of Herbert W. Franke's diverse artworks, and his openness to experimentation with new technologies, such as plotter drawings, screens, screenprints, or 2D and 3D digital renderings.\n\nThis project, while not designed to be a formal statistical evaluation, is but my fun, colorful, and humble response to your inquiry, dear Herbert.\n\n---\n\n25% of primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke, with the goal of raising 20,000 Euros so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any money raised beyond this goal will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• Double-click/tap or 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n\nNote: Some mints require WEBGL and/or may take several seconds to fully render.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid",

It was presented at OSA / J.W. Sterlick Gallery in Ottawa from Oct 6 - Nov 13 2022 and at Art Toronto from Oct 27 – 30 2022\n\nThe digital generative token expresses various possible stages in the lifetime of what that object could be as a human scale architectural work. Is it being built or is in decay?  It’s in that brief moment when something is being built or dismantled that you can see and understand its inner structure, that you have the privileged access to the secrets of its conception. It’s vulnerable and fragile but also light and elegant. The unfinished quality leaves place for imagination to guess where the piece came or is going.\n\nOne of the main purpose of this token is the possibility to have it 3D printed. The default STL output size 78x78x78 mm is the minimal recommended size for printing. Large sizes may produce better quality prints and minimize breakage risks.\n",
