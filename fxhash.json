Much like the gods and goddesses of Norse mythology, \"Asta\" dwells in a space where disparate forces like unity and fragmentation or chaos and order find harmony.\n\nThe visual core of the artwork is composed of concentric circles meticulously shaped from individual spheres.

As viewers traverse the delicate balance between intricate patterns and intentional anomalies, they are compelled to confront the eternal dualities symbolized in Norse mythology—such as order and chaos, the finite and the infinite, and the divine and the mortal.\n\nFor those who engage with it, \"Asta\" serves as more than just an art piece.
