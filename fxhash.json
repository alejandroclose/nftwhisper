            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch F(ree). A gift to all Sketch A-E collectors. The underlying grid structure from A-E remains, but more variation on size and distribution is added. Many more color palettes are introduced. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.",

            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

A work based on MEK.txt’s “The Bento Boxes” and IceRain’s excellent codes, Bento Boxes aims to be a fun visual and code exploration project on the generative art corridor. Pure code, no libraries.\n\nBento Boxes deconstructed the visual system on MEK.txt's artwork, titled almost similarly, “The Bento Boxes”. Rebuilt it from scratch with codes, adding variants of colours and shapes— without losing the strong characteristics of the base artwork. \n",

            "description": "Square Planets was inspired by a series of OP Art paintings done by Victor Vasarely, called Planetary Folklore Participations No. 2. (c. 1970). Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the third in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nSquare Planets consists of four layers of squares contained within a background square superimposed on top of one another. Each layer is translated from the previous layer but still lies within its boundaries. The background color of each layer is random and its set of squares are another random color. The squares that make up layers two and three are rotated either clockwise or counter-clockwise some random number of degrees within a predetermined range. \n\nThere are many Gestalt interactions within this piece. Layers (square planets) interact with each other in interesting ways. Each new generation with its random color assignments significantly affect your depth perception. Layers appear to come forward or recede. Sometimes there is more \"after-imagism\" between the square sets. Candy for your mind.",
