            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "Monad 1960 is a collection of generative artworks created using JavaScript code, inspired by the generative art movement that emerged in the 1960s. Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of basic modules, or 'monads', that are combined and transformed through an algorithmic process to generate a unique generative artwork.\n\nIn philosophy, the term 'monad' was used by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz to describe the basic and indivisible unit of reality. In generative art, the term 'monad' refers to the simple elements that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create artworks.\n\nPioneers of generative art, such as Vera Molnar, Michael Noll, and John Whitney, experimented with the use of algorithms to generate artworks. These artists developed computer programs and mechanical systems that used simple patterns and shapes to create complex and dynamic artworks. In this context, 'monads' became the fundamental building blocks of these generative artworks.\n\nIn the Monad 1960 collection, programming and algorithmic design are used to generate unique artworks that reflect the principles of the generative art movement. Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of 'monads' that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create a unique generative artwork, exploring the relationship between the simplicity of the 'monads' and the complexity of the resulting generative artworks.\n\nFeatures:\n8 background colors.\n8 canvas sizes.\n45 types of number groups that create different paths for the algorithm.\n\nThe animation lasts 30 seconds, so I recommend waiting until it finishes before downloading the artwork.\nPress \"S\" to download the image.\n\nCreated by Fernando Cabral.",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

If the piece is too dark, reduce the render length or increase the stroke weight. If the piece seems too light, alter the volatility of the noise, or slow it down with increased friction. Each parameter can, of course, be explained in great detail, but in reality the best way to work with the piece is to play.\n\nThe random numbers for the piece are generated using the minter's address, meaning that what you see as a live preview will be the exact mint received.",

By dividing the space using this mathematical sequence, the project generates a unique sense of rhythm and contrast between blocks of different sizes. To render the project, millions of dots are used to create intricate lines, resulting in a stunning visual display.\n\nThrough this project, I hope to inspire others to explore the intersection of mathematics and art. By incorporating the Fibonacci sequence into the piece, the inherent elegance of mathematical principles is showcased in a beautiful and artistic way.\n",

This simple activity is teaching kids about gravity, cause and effect, and imposing their will on the world around them. As children grow older, the gap between these opposing actions widens. The intention behind knocking things down becomes less innocent, and creators aren't as excited to see their work destroyed.\n\nIn 1915, the Russian avant-garde founded the abstract art movement known as Constructivism, rejecting everything except for the absolute purest aspects of form and material. This art was used in service of the Russian revolution and utilized heavily in its propaganda, intended to highlight the utilitarian nature of industrial progress. Mainly, building the new Russia. Its influence is lasting, and can be seen throughout art and design trends even today.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, footage of missiles and airstrikes decimating Ukrainian buildings permeated the media. Ukrainian lives, kitchens, windowsill gardens, and family photos tumbled to the ground. Like children's blocks. Things that took a lifetime to build were destroyed in seconds. \n\nKONSTRUKTS represents this duality in creation and destruction. Stacked children's blocks are rendered in the style of Constructivist designs like El Lissitzky's Proun series, and Alexander Rodchenko's posters. With a simple tap, blocks (or buildings) can be knocked to the ground.\n\n- Tap anywhere to reveal the KONSTRUKTS menu in the top left. Tap the menu for several options.\n- KONSTRUKTS can be exported as USDZ or GLTF models to be used in augmented reality or the metaverse.\n- Export a full resolution PNG image from the menu.\n- If you knocked over the blocks, you can reset them from the menu.\n\nKONSTRUKTS is built entirely with code, using Three.js, JavaScript, and GLSL.",

            "description": "A Cellular Dice Piece\n\nComputational modeling is the use of computers to simulate and study complex systems using mathematics, physics and computer science. A computational model contains numerous variables that characterize the system being studied. Simulation is done by adjusting the variables alone or in combination and observing the outcomes. Computer modeling allows scientists to conduct thousands of simulated experiments by computer. The thousands of computer experiments identify the handful of laboratory experiments that are most likely to solve the problem being studied.\n\nToday's sociocultural discourse might obscure the fact that humanity has been using artificial modeling techniques since ancient times. Permutations, calculus, algorithms are not exclusive to our time, but these are ubiquituous methods that can be found in many cultural entities where members of the community progress and develop their environment through cooperative decisions and consensus. Since computers were not available in the past, calculation methods, application of chance, randomness and probability were performed using other methods, like dices, sticks, cards, weather, rituals or other manifestations.\n\nDice are small, throwable objects with marked sides that can rest in multiple positions. They are used for generating random numbers, commonly as part of tabletop games, including dice games, board games, role-playing games, and games of chance. A traditional die is a cube with each of its six faces marked with a different number of dots (pips) from one to six. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing a random integer from one to six on its upper surface, with each value being equally likely. These tools were often used when a decision required to outsource human subjective elements into an objective environment.\n\nDivination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appears to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. If a distinction is to be made between divination and fortune-telling, divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a religious context, as seen in traditional African medicine. Divination has long been criticized. In the modern era, it has been dismissed by the scientific community and skeptics as being superstitious; experiments do not support the idea that divination techniques can actually predict the future more reliably or precisely than would be possible without it.\n\nThis idea is especially adaptable to the data driven belief systems of our time, where human decision making involves trust in omnipresent although obscure and biased artificial intelligence, esoteric pattern analysis, DIY heuristics, magic numbers among others. \n\nPress 'h' to switch between high/low resolution pixel density (set to low for mobiles)\n\nTouch to listen",
