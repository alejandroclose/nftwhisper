            "description": "REIN\n\nA generative approach to personal interpretation of reincarnation\n\nIt is not my right and job to prove the existence of reincarnation, but the concept makes a good dialogue for my heart and also is a fun challenge for my brain.\n\n1. About the role:\n\nThe element on the screen is basically the metaphor for every object/person in your current life.\n\nAs the ACTOR, you can make choice under your instant willingness and travel in this world with limited time.\n\nAs the OBSERVER you can watch the above and question and dialogue with the ACTOR and alter its choice.\n\n2. About the visualizations:\n\nIn order to present our big world in a limited 2D graphical approach. I shrink the dimensions and the detail of the existing reality.\n\nHumans and Objects are dots, 3D entities like us become tiny dots (zero dimension) on a 3D space where their activity is backward translated to 2D perspective coordinates\n\nInteractions between two entities are lines, and in our world planes or shapes were formed when interactions involved multiple people or objects. Which becomes an event.\n\nWe now as observer from the higher ground can witness the events’ change, progress, and karma by the continuous growth of the plane into various shapes.\n\nEvery world we reincarnated back into will have a visual color and an audio color tone. It is considered to be the theme of that particular life.\n\nThe final composition becomes a mix of the above, everything is merely the same but everything yet looks different. Depends on your perspective.\"\n\n3. Some personal sharing thru creating REIN:\n\nLife is short - I am happy if you are feeling annoyed and you feel the screen comes and fades so fast. Indeed this is my personal feeling about life, too short and things ended before you realize it.\n\nSome life is super long and boring - I am also happy if you felt so. So sing and discover your song of life when you are in the room. It happens once only with this combination.\n\nNo time to prepare/predict/prejudge - but you can enjoy cause you/he/she/it/they/we will end in here suddenly. So enjoy the up and down, sweet and sour of every bit.\n\nThere is always an intangible target and goal preset to you, and it cast a line between you and it. You can choose to ignore it or be actively chasing it. But no matter which choices you made, your locus was left and shown in front of your eyes.\n\n4. Observer’s responsibility and award\nThis work inspires me that in life we can both be the actors/actress and also the observer.\n\nWhat matters more to you?\nThe background, your choice, or both?\nAre you the observer guy who sits and doesn’t move?\nAre you moving towards the [goal] linking with you? Do you keep chasing it?\nAre you caring about the background more? Do you have a feeling they somehow related to you?\nOr do you simply move your life freely without caring about the other happening?\nYour voice is too loud or not?\nWill you find the background noise too loud?\nWhat can you do with it?\nIf the target connected to you is hollow and empty, would you still care about it?\n\nAnd Why? Why do you feel so?\nWhich part of the above dialogue is related to your existing life?\nWhat can we do/change/keep?\nWhat you really can control?\"\n\n\n// [Click] - The sound of the work can be muted by clicking again the screen\n// [s] - Take a selfie of this world and you inside\n// [spacebar] - you can stop the time and walk/think freely like NEO in the matrix\n\nBehind [REIN]\nAs a generative artist, I force myself to seek the possible ways to use these tools/skills/presentation forms.\n\nIn Traveler, it is about finding the difference between being alone and feeling loneliness\nIn FEA, it is about possibilities\nIn BULLET, it is about courage and faith\nIn REIN, I hope we can treasure what we lost and gained.\n\nArt to me can be the visualization of aesthetics or a mutually enjoyable creative process for you and me.\n\nOr like this time in REIN.\n\nA journey towards our room inside our heart shape box.",

            "description": "I had a wonderful childhood. I grew up near a big lake, in a house with a huge garden. You could get lost for the whole day, building houses on trees, collecting flowers and stones or stealing food from the vegetable garden. Having a brother of the same age made things even better, endless adventures with somebody saving you every time you are too dumb to realize you are walking into troubles.\n\nWe enjoyed the summers with the hot days, the fireflies and the nights full of falling stars. The winters with the snow, the stalactites and our box turtle disappearing for months to then reappear in the spring (Until she did not).\n\nAt the same time, taking care of the garden was a big responsibility, affecting our family life in many ways. Numerous times, I felt like the efforts we were putting in to keep it in order were never enough and nature was always faster in restoring her point of view. A struggle that affects us humans since we started to bend nature at our will, thousands of years ago.\n\nIn my gardens, I tried to capture this struggle, this constant fight to shape nature at our will.\nHowever, I also tried to represent the beauty that can be found in both savage and human shaped nature, if shaped with love and respect.\n\nI dedicate this project to my grandfather, who gave us a garden.\nI am sure he would have loved it.\n\n---\n\nHand coded with love and obsession. 💚\n\nPowered by p5, p5.createLoop and chroma.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\nPress ‘m’ to open a menu with the available outputs.\n\nThe generation of a hi-res image, up to 8000x8000, takes a few seconds.\nThe generation of an Animated GIF takes several minutes and the save command works only once the GIF is complete.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters that can be used to load different configurations.\n\n- mode = 0 | 1\n0 For static PNG images, 1 for animated GIFs\n\n- size = s | m | l\nThe Size of the output, 1080x1080, 4000x4000, 8000x8000 for static images and 512x512, 800x800, 1080x1080 for animated GIFs\n\n- fps = 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30\nFrames per second of animated GIFs\n\n=============> PROFILES <==============\n\t\nWeeds ------------------> 42%\nShapes -----------------> 7%\nFlower Power -----------> 5%\nStrips -----------------> 5%\nBadlands ---------------> 5%\nCircle Flower Packing --> 5%\nIna's Farm -------------> 5%\nFortified Pond ---------> 3%\nFalling Into You -------> 3%\nCultivar ---------------> 2%\nThe Hedge --------------> 2%\nRocky Mountains --------> 2%\nUnreachable Rivers -----> 2%\nMushrooms Heaven -------> 2%\nDante ------------------> 1.75%\nAcid Lands -------------> 1.75%\nProvence ---------------> 1.5%\nThe Springs ------------> 1.25%\nSecret Garden ----------> 1%\nThe Pump ---------------> 1%\nTetris -----------------> 1%\nThe Spiral -------------> 0.5%\nKinetic Sculpture ------> 0.25%\n\nInsects are visible only in the animated outputs.\n\n=============> MAKING OF <=============\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/article/the-making-of-noisy-gardens\n\n---",

Mixing etching, silk-screening, offset, photocopy, risography, drawing and painting to design and craft experimental art books.From the day digital, which had always fascinated me, took over my publishing practice, I always liked to create bridges between these two worlds.\n\nThe Living Books is part of this series of hybrid and experimental works where paper and digital resonate.\n\nThis issue #2 is made of 64 pages that will be minted by collectors. A book will eventually be printed and the pages will follow the mint order. Each page exists in a cover version (c) and a xerox version (x).\n\nControls :\n\n• Click to dive into each frame.\n• Press C to toggle cover mode.\n• Press X to toggle xerox mode.\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nThe Living Book #2 Moonrise by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

Mixing etching, silk-screening, offset, photocopy, risography, drawing and painting to design and craft experimental art books.From the day digital, which had always fascinated me, took over my publishing practice, I always liked to create bridges between these two worlds.\n\nThe Living Books is part of this series of hybrid and experimental works where paper and digital resonate.\n\nThis issue #2 is made of 64 pages that will be minted by collectors. A book will eventually be printed and the pages will follow the mint order. Each page exists in a cover version (c) and a xerox version (x).\n\nControls :\n\n• Click to dive into each frame.\n• Press C to toggle cover mode.\n• Press X to toggle xerox mode.\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nThe Living Book #2 Moonrise by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "\"A mille-feuille (French pronunciation: ​[mil fœj], \"thousand-sheets\"), also known by the names Napoleon, vanilla slice, and custard slice, is a dessert made of puff pastry layered with pastry cream. Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.\n\nTraditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry (pâte feuilletée), alternating with two layers of pastry cream (crème pâtissière). The top pastry layer is finished in various ways: sometimes it is topped with whipped cream, or it may be dusted with icing sugar, cocoa, pastry crumbs, or sliced almonds. It may also be glazed with icing or fondant alone, or in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) or other colored icing stripes, and combed to create a marbled effect.\" — Wikipedia\n\nPrints available upon request: prints@stefancontiero.com\nBest enjoyed on browsers supporting Display-P3 color gamut.\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n@stefan_contiero\n",
