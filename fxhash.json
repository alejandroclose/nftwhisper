            "description": "Errance - an exploration of abstract and digital glitch fusion. The algorithm crafts the concept and structure, while randomness navigates the detailed textures, exploring the interplay between systematic design and the unforeseen aspects of randomness. Errance represents a journey of discovery, one without a defined endpoint, capturing the unexpected and fortuitous outcomes that emerge as algorithms navigate freely, leaving a trail of unique and unpredictable patterns.\n\nBest experienced in live mode at high resolution, the outputs vary significantly due to multiple features, occasionally favouring a slightly asymmetric balance. Under the hood, the algorithm employs a combination of recursive functions, 3D primitives, and multiple textures derived from trigonometric and noise functions using p5.js. Last but not least, during rendering, the outputs are enhanced by one of several versions of a GLSL shader.\n\nIn live mode:\n-press 1 to save a 2K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 2 for a 4K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 3 to render a version without passepartout.\n-press 4 for a 2k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.\n-press 5 for a 4k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.",

Different species evolve and interact together, resulting in stabilizing patterns out of their parametric configurations. A form of artificial life.\n\nThis work is based on the paper \"Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks\", written by Jeff Jones and popularized in the artistic field by Sage Jenson. Some features were added to increase the visual and behavioral complexity of the system. Agents are divided into different species, with their own set of rules and interacting with their own substrate. Substrates also interact with each other and agents will mutate in contact of some of them.\n\nNFT License\nRuns properly on Chrome 97.0.4692.99\nGPU intensive\n\nPress P to pause (double tab touch devices)\nPress",

            "description": "Errance - an exploration of abstract and digital glitch fusion. The algorithm crafts the concept and structure, while randomness navigates the detailed textures, exploring the interplay between systematic design and the unforeseen aspects of randomness. Errance represents a journey of discovery, one without a defined endpoint, capturing the unexpected and fortuitous outcomes that emerge as algorithms navigate freely, leaving a trail of unique and unpredictable patterns.\n\nBest experienced in live mode at high resolution, the outputs vary significantly due to multiple features, occasionally favouring a slightly asymmetric balance. Under the hood, the algorithm employs a combination of recursive functions, 3D primitives, and multiple textures derived from trigonometric and noise functions using p5.js. Last but not least, during rendering, the outputs are enhanced by one of several versions of a GLSL shader.\n\nIn live mode:\n-press 1 to save a 2K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 2 for a 4K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 3 to render a version without passepartout.\n-press 4 for a 2k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.\n-press 5 for a 4k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.",

            "description": "All generative art on fx(hash) comes about through a unique collaboration between artist and minter. Each artwork has a deterministic component provided by the artist, the generative algorithm, and a random component provided by the minter, the transaction hash. The minter creates the random component, the hash, through the act of minting a token and leaving a transaction record on the blockchain. In this way, the minter is permanently linked to the specific iteration that they personally created.\n\nTo celebrate this collaborative effort between artist and minter, this collection dedicates all royalties from secondary sales to the respective minting wallets. Primary proceeds, on the other hand, will be sent to a smart contract wallet collecting funds in support of humanitarian aid in Ukraine. For details, see: https://twitter.com/fx_hash_/status/1497113575466360837.\n\nThe core generative algorithm employed is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), implemented in AssemblyScript and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for maximum performance. The WASM code is embedded into a JavaScript program that generates an input dataset, runs it through the t-SNE algorithm, and then visualizes the output with colored dots. The final artwork is a static SVG file that can be downloaded and displayed at any resolution. All color palettes are computationally generated and have random components. No external libraries have been used.\n\nCode and outputs are Copyright (C) 2022 Claus O. Wilke and are licensed to the general public under CC BY-NC 4.0. In addition, token holders are granted a non-exclusive, irrevocable, non-transferrable license to reproduce the output corresponding to their token, in any medium, for any purpose, inluding for commercial gain, for as long as they hold the token.\n\nPress 's' to save as svg.\n\nPress 'p' to save as png.\n\nAuthor:\nClaus O.

            "description": "Morixels Mega Colab is the first and one of the biggest Collaborations that happen on the FXHash  and also in Morixels Land.\n\nIn this Collaboration, 19 artists have designed their artwork as pixel art. Each artist has 5 Artworks in this collection, which have been randomly combined with Borders that I designed (Morteza Yousefi, idea owner and art director)\n\nThis combination has got a beautiful effect in a random way, and besides that, it makes this collection very valuable because of the reputation and Ideas of the 20 artists.\n\nThe number of Traits in this collection is 5 (137 layers) and it has the ability to make 930,240 NFTs.\n\nTo create balance, these NFTs are randomly minted, and this is a chance for everyone to get a rare version. So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\n\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\n🟧🟦\n🟧🟧\n\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nMade in 2022\n\nDesigned by: \n@morteza_yousefy\n@ardavan_\n@happyfamily1985\n@Raze_Slb\n@Didoxme\n@mo0n_zi\n@mahdirezafathi\n@HrishNft\n@HeleDesignnft\n@SebastianVamp21\n@farahmand1989\n@Samaneh_syd\n@ma_khalaji\n@negar_khozhandi\n@lvcteam8\n@Elid_33\n@OmidMahdavi7\n@ehsan_special\n@OmidiNariman\n@ARTsnakeNFT\n\n",

            "description": "Just,Steven - is a shell that has always followed me, or has been a part of me, I never fully understood. This is a character who ironically, because of the many social culture shifts in his life, began to resort to the way of putting other people's faces and stories on himself. At first it was necessary to adapt in a certain circle of society so as not to be a black sheep, after a few years he stopped noticing how the consciousness itself uses the stories or phrases he has already heard from absolutely different people received during a conversation, news or other, another of the features is the numerous personalities of Steven.\n\nI am creating this project because I have long wanted to try to tell people that being yourself is the most difficult and wonderful feeling. My goal is to get an animated movie adaptation on Netflix, the script will be written by anyone who wants to participate in the community. \n\nPeace be with you all!",

Intrigued by this challenge, I've delved deep into the pixels of this issue. 🙂\n\nDrawing inspiration from Rev Dan Catt’s 'Tally!' and applying similar principles of Cable Management, I've assembled a fun and free OE project.\n\nThis project dynamically evolves with each iteration.Grid is determined by a random value calculated as follows: the lower bound starts at 3 and increases incrementally with every 100 iterations, while the upper bound starts at 4 and increases with every 30 iterations. In practical terms, as the iteration count increases, both the minimum and maximum possible number of cols&rows gradually increase.\n\n3200x3200px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",
