            "description": "This could be a follow-up to Herbert W. Franke's finding of interesting connections between Constructivism and Generative art, where at first, technological limits allowed only simple line drawings, based on fixed proportions, and later were extended by the use of random generators. Constructivism, as an art movement, sought to depict modern civilization, the symbiotic relationship between technology and art, industrialization, and urban spaces. Iakov Chernikhov (Яков Чернихов), an architect and graphic artist, was one of the influential figures in Constructivism. He extensively used the two-point perspective with an observation point below the ground in his drawings. \n\nIn this (my) exploration of two-point perspective, random, colorful, and glassy constructions visual resemblance to Chernikhov’s oeuvre is inescapable. Therefore the title is a play on the original title of his book Architectural Fantasies: 101 Compositions in Color, 101 Architectural Miniatures from 1933.\n\nThe subtle grain effect is done with p5.grain library by Gorilla Sun (@gorillasu) & meezwhite (@meezwhite). \n\nLook out for the FOMO keyboard key to unlock more variations.",

            "description": "What would you do if you found a lost wallet; return it to it's owner or keep it? \n\nAs an experiment, i'll send a NFT (another visual pattern created by same algorithm as 1/1) at random times to each of the created wallet addresses to see what happens:\n\nHow many of them are going to be transferred to the owner of the wallet, how many will be stolen? How many of them will be transferred again when the piece is resold? \n\n\"Lost Wallets' is a visual wallet generator which uses a cellulator automata algorithm to encrypt and visualize mnemonics words choosen from the bip39 dictionary. The circular pattern is an encrypted visual representation of seed phrases that create a unique crypto wallet. Each of these patterns can be reversed back to the seed phrases by reversing the rules used in encryption.  \n\nWhen i was as a kid, it was fascinating to code to send encrypted messages between friends even though algorithm was very simple. Encryption was something which always fascinated me. It inspired me to create something which uses cryptography to create visual outputs in order to create true 'crypto-art. Rather than purely relying on text and numbers I wanted to paint those 1s and 0s with color and shapes. \n\nAs \"crypto-art' became the definition of digital art signed by the blockchain, I think crypto-art is an artform which is created by cryptography algorithms, which paved the way to the creation of this piece. \n\nUnder the Hood:\n \nThe algorithm picks 8 to 15 non repeating words from bip39 dictionary (a special dictionary for wallet generation). Then it converts each word into binary array (Ones and zeros) to feed the initial sequence of celluar automata algorithm. In this piece, i have used radial placement to display the bits created by the cellular automata algorithm; which i think creates some interesting visuals combined with perlin noise distortion, resembling cellular forms seen under microscope. \n\nAs the words are chosen from bip39 dictionary, each image represents a tezos wallet which has a wallet address and can be imported to 'Temple Wallet' using the private key, which i think of airdropping some random nfts in the future to those wallets just for experimentation.\n\nExport Options:\n\n*Chrome is recommended for exports(Faster and higher resolution)\n\nPress 1 to 8 to export PNG multiples of 1920px\n\nPress 'k' to download information of created wallet. Highly recommend importing secret keys to Temple Wallet, so you can re-transfer when you recieve the airdrop to the created wallet before anyone else.\n\n***The wallets generated through this code is not intended for real life use. Secret key can be accessed by everyone. It's created for art purposes***\n\nCreated with p5.js & TezTech\nMurat Atimtay 2022 ",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "If light, which is generally a wave, can also sometimes be a particle - then can matter also be a wave? Louis De Broglie suggested this idea, which is supported by performing a double slit experiment with matter particles and producing an interference pattern that indicates wave behaviour. Performing the experiment with one particle at a time also produces an interference pattern, implying the particles create interference with themselves. One way this could be possible is if the particle travels infinite potential paths simultaneously, super positioning itself in many places at once. If one electron can be in infinite places at once, is it possible that all electrons are that same one? More than thinking everything is connected, can we go one further and think that everything is the same thing? \n\n'Matter Waves' super positions connections between constellated nodes, spreading them out through space in multiple ways - an aesthetic exploration of these ideas. \n\n's' to save large file\n'1' to watch it load slowly \n'2' to watch it load super slowly\n\nFully live code in p5js\n\nwww.amygoodchild.com\n@amygoodchild",

            "description": "Overgrowth was an experiment in mixed brushes, and random walks, to create complex scribble landscapes. Overgrowth X8 takes the concept a number of steps forward.\n\nThe first change is that there are 8 brush heads rather than 1. The starting location of these brush heads have been curated into 6 sets.\n\na) Four Corners - 2 brush heads emanating from each corner,\nb) All Together Now - All brush heads starting at the same low central location,\nc) Great Monument (sometimes),\nd) Upon this Slope, these structures are built,\ne) Heaven and Earth - 4 brush heads at the top and 4 at the bottom, sometimes they meet,\nf) Random Landscaper - All brush heads randomly placed in the lower part of the canvas.\n\nEach brushes white ellipses are now a randomised shade of very light grey. This gives slightly more depth.\n\nAs the brushes usually do not randomly fill the whole canvas, there is a background that has been built to be consistent with the drawing, rather than just using a solid color or mono light bands.\n\nWhite and black stroke sizes have been adapted to give a slightly wider range of effects.\n\nPress s to save a 2400x2400 jpg.\n\nPlease note that the progressive rendering may not work on mobile and may be slow on some browsers.\n\nCreated with p5.js.
