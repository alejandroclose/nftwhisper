As machines enter into our societies - our ecologies - we may think what would be like a society of machines only. What are portraits of said machines without us humans around? Will they want to seek for their individual character, much like we do? It will depend on their personalities, their will, their intent, their traumas... their versions of all of this. We shall need to understand what their motivations will be like - what the potential basis for their potential version of a potential conscience is and how it will evolve. Only through a good understanding of diversity can we reach a functioning system. Both for ecologies with machines as well as ecologies without.\n\necologías-C is an entity that is part of a broader ecology. Released on occasion of the show \"Unbound - Ecology in the Age of Machines\" at Unit London. The data generated by this entity is read by a different piece minted on Ethereum, creating a link between Tezos and Ethereum, a metaphor for an ecology of blockchains.\n\nit shares a common element with two other works released on fxhash: ecologías A and ecologías B, all of them contributing data to aforementioned pieces.\n\nTo know more, visit https://www.iillucid.com/ecologias\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nBuilt on p5.js, glsl.\n\nappend &pd=N (N a number) to the URL in live view to increase/decrease resolution\npress s to save current image in current resolution\npress z,x,g,b,n followed by +/- to increase/decrease, respectively, brightness, contrast, gamma, blur, noise",

The ability to create unique, one-of-a-kind pieces using code is truly fascinating to me.\n\nGenerative art allows for a level of artistic expression that is simply not possible with traditional mediums. Using algorithms and mathematical principles allows for creating complex, dynamic visuals that are constantly evolving and changing.\n\nWhat I find particularly interesting about generative art is its focus on the creation process. Rather than simply producing a static, finished product, the artist is more concerned with the journey and the process of creating the art. This allows for experimentation and exploration that is impossible in more traditional forms of art.\n\nIn my own work, I strive to push the boundaries of generative art and explore new possibilities. I constantly experiment with different algorithms and techniques to create something new and unique.\n\nI am excited to continue learning and growing as an artist and to see where my passion for generative art will take me.\n\nThe collection is a tribute to the art of coding and its endless possibilities for artistic expression. From mesmerizing geometric patterns to pulsating colour fields, each piece in the collection is a testament to the endless potential of code as a medium for artistic creation.\n\nPrevious collectors are automatically on the reserve list for this exclusive collection. This is a rare opportunity to own a piece of generative art that captures the imagination and celebrates the beauty of code.\n\nPress [S] to save.",

            "description": "\"In the boundless loneliness of space, strangeness abounds.\"\nT E C T O N I C A logs\n\nStanding here are the digital engrams of a spacefaring civilization, the final remnants of the Universe's vast computer, a layered stratum of glitched, galaxy-sized digital memory banks. These calcified data deposits have accumulated over eons, forming physical tectons that span light-years of space. They offer a glimpse into the fundamental building blocks employed by a forgotten alien civilization which encoded its entire culture as digital data in physical form. While the specifications for this stellar machine have been lost to time, its fractured components continue to perform computations, seemingly trapped in an eternal loop. We can observe the inner workings of this enigmatic structure, but its true meaning remains forever silent, its message encrypted.\n\nT E C T O N I C A serves as an artistic exploration of this fictional world and its algorithm-driven deep-space geology. Collectors can reserve their iteration by minting a ticket and use the params interface to choose their seed number and triptych part. Generator uses a WYSIWYG principle to derive a PRNG seed from the wallet address and the chosen seed number. There are 1000 seeds available for each wallet. You can explore seeds using a separate seed explorer here:\n\nhttps://protocell-labs.github.io/tectonica-seed-explorer/\n\n__________\n\nT E C T O N I C A is written in JavaScript using Three.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry and in-browser rendering (see LICENSE file for the list of all dependencies). We recommend using Chromium browser on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration to get the full functionality (like key controls). Please ensure that the token functions correctly on your device before minting.\n\nUse click (touch) to explode / unexplode the structure, click hold (touch hold) to set new explosion center (also E + click), P for pause / unpause palette cycle, B to change background color, S to download loader animation, G for gif capture, and numbers 1-5 to export progressively higher resolution of the artwork as a png image. Available URL parameters are listed in the browser console.\n\nWe paid tribute to artists and personalities who inspire our work by naming color palettes after them. To support other fellow artists on their creative journeys, we have left T E C T O N I C A code open (unminified and unobfuscated) and available in a public repository on GitHub. We believe that supporting open tools is a mission every generative artist should partake in.\n\nCreated in 2024 by {protocell:labs}",

            "description": "ASCII-SCAPE\n\nLike for many others growing up during the 1980s & 90s, my very first hands-on encounter with actual computer graphics (outside of games) was in the form of \"textmode\" and its various alphanumeric characters and other symbols available on the 8bit home computers of that period. These machines were perfectly capable of producing fairly high-resolution & multi-color graphics (all relative), yet most systems booted into an interactive prompt with the so-called textmode as de-facto standard environment, providing a level, if also limited, playing field for the creation of text-based graphics from a patchwork of characters & symbols of a predefined font (system or custom). As is so often the case, limitation is the mother of invention and the regular, monospaced grid and standardized set of characters quickly encouraged an entire subculture of specialized designers & artists to emerge (which is currently being re-discovered & remixed by younger generations), applying & showcasing their creativity (with often surprisingly ingenious skills) in the form of game designs, user interfaces, disk mags, demoscene productions, competitions, flyers, BBSes and even various early Web designs of the mid/late 90s.\n\nASCII-SCAPE is an attempted non-nostalgic homage to these roots & culture. It is also a textmode-only (no canvas!) rework of my previous piece C-SCAPE. It combines my love of cellular automata with the stripped back aesthetics & limitations of using only text as representation medium of these co-evolving generative systems. It required an almost complete rewrite & re-curation of various elements: 1200+ new handpicked rule combinations, 32 character sets, 40 color themes, new relationships & biases to better manage the resulting textures, densities and contrast.\n\nAlthough technically not strictly \"ASCII\" (an actual standard, but also a popular shorthand for \"text only\"), the entire simulation only uses various Unicode characters and the beautiful Iosevka open source typeface by Renzhi Li aka Belleve Invis.\n\nLike its parent C-SCAPE, this project is dynamic and evolves indefinitely. It's best viewed on non-mobile devices, where there's a decent horizontal resolution to provide sufficient simulation space. Please see the C-SCAPE project description for further details. There's no graphical export feature, but output can be captured into an UTF-8 plain text file (max. 100k lines/generations).\n\nThe following keyboard shortcuts are available:\n\n- space : toggle simulation updates (pause/play)\n- r : randomize environment\n- x : start/stop recording\n- f : toggle scroll speed (fast/slow)\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nIosevka typeface licensed under OFL-1.1 license\n\nhttps://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and https://thi.ng",

            "description": "Un de mes frères s’est envolé hier. Ou avant-hier, je ne sais plus. Il a vendu du lest pour sortir une fille. Une bourrasque soudaine les a emportés, lui et ses deux tickets de cinéma.\n\nCela fait bien trois semaines que nous n’avons pas eu de livraison. Pas de courrier non plus, par la même occasion. J’en reçois rarement. Je n’ai jamais reçu qu’une lettre, en réalité. C’était une longue lettre épistolaire de mon ami Dino. Il est cowboy, dans une cité voisine. \n\nMon frère connaissait cette fille depuis bien cinq ou six ans. Il étaient au collège ensemble. Il y avait encore des livraisons toutes les semaines, à cette époque. Parfois deux fois par semaine. On pouvait vendre des enclumes et acheter du petit lest. Poids pour poids, on y perdait. Mais avec ça on arrivait quand même à vivre.\n\nC’était le temps où les rochers n’étaient pas attachés. Ils dérivaient rarement, le vent n’était pas si fort. Et ils étaient plus denses aussi. Aujourd’hui, un rocher qui n’est pas en laisse ne sera plus là demain.\n\nÀ l’époque, j’étais moi-même cowboy. Je vivais avec Jacques, un bon copain. Il n’y avait rien de sexuel entre nous. On gardait les rochers. Un soir, on jouait à l’espagnolette, il m’a relancé de trois alors que j’étais atout trèfle. Vous imaginez la suite. Je ne l’ai plus jamais revu après ça.\n\nPlus personne ne va au collège. Mon frère était d’une des dernières générations. Après ça les gens ne voyaient plus l’intérêt. Tout devient de plus en plus léger, et apprendre à lire ou écrire ne pèse rien. Plus on mine, plus on vends des enclumes, plus on peut acheter du lest. Mais comme le lest est plus cher que les enclumes, à force, la cité devient de moins en moins lourde.\n\nLe vent est de plus en plus fort aussi. Je pense que c’est pour ça qu’il y a moins de livraisons. Il y a de moins en moins de cités qui arrivent à rester suspendues. Celle de Dino s’est envolée l’année dernière, Dino avec. Avec moins de cités à visiter par voyage, les livraisons sont moins rentables.\n\nAvant d’être cowboy je construisais des ponts. C’est comme ça que j’ai appris à lier les rochers. Plus personne ne le fait aujourd’hui. Il faut commencer par ancrer le rocher domestique. Et après, il faut attendre. C’est la partie la plus difficile. Personne n’a appris à suffisamment attendre. Parce que plus le temps passe, plus on devient légers. Mais c’est le plus important. Il faut attendre le que rocher sauvage devienne suffisamment léger. Sinon, il emportera le rocher domestique avec lui et on aura tout perdu.\n\nJe me demande pourquoi il a acheté ces deux tickets de cinéma. C’est toujours le même film qui passe. Je ne l’ai jamais vu. Ça parle de dialectique et de maçonnerie, il paraît. Le cinéma c’est un domaine que je trouve trop contraignant. Encore une idée de bureaucrate. Places assignées. Horaires fixes. Un processus administratif au profit de la structure sociale. Classique. Les bureaucrates commencent toujours par nous exploiter et ils finissent par nous aliéner. “Servir le peuple”, ils appellent ça. \n\nCela fait des années que le pont est de moins en moins solide. De toutes les façons, on n’a rien pour le réparer. Nos rochers sont domestiqués depuis le temps, mais ils s’entrainent les uns les autres au lieu de se stabiliser. La suspension des cités, ça a l’air simple mais ça ne l’est pas vraiment. Quand elles ont été construites, avec les machines-outils des livreurs, elles étaient bien suspendues. Mais peu à peu, elles se sont dégradées. La seule richesse des cités, c’est leur gravité. Pourquoi réparer ce qui est destiné à s’envoler ?\n\nJe comprends pourquoi mon frère a vendu du lest. Après tout, le lest est là pour être vendu tant qu’il vaut encore quelque chose. Jeudi dernier, le pont est tombé. Notre deuxième rocher majeur est toujours relié par la chaine des rochers mineurs, mais elle ne va pas tenir longtemps. La cité va s’envoler bientôt. Peut-être demain ou après-demain. Je vous laisse, je dois aller miner.",
