            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

This algorithm aims to cram a bunch of circles into space as tightly as possible. This is a well-explored topic throughout the history of mathematics, but at the end of the day it's mathematics, it's BORING. So to make 'Fizz' a little bit thrilling and different, I wrote an algorithm that randomly draws 450 circles with totally different radiuses (range(width * 0.1, width * 0.001) to be exact) on a canvas, and checks each circle, if the randomly chosen location is a good fit for a new circle to avoid collisions.\n\nCombined with some cool colors and gradients for both the background and the circles, this procedure is all it took to produce 'Fizz'.\nBereft of meaning, feel free to interpret it as you please.",

Modernism is an idea that emphasizes the power of man to create, improve and change the shape of his environment, using science, technology and practical experiments.\nAlong with modern art, the role of traditional elements of my surroundings has been used in this collection. In general, the motif is actually an abstraction of the face of nature and reaching simple forms. The motif is used in painting, visual arts, drama, literature, music and architecture, and it can have its cultural identifiers in various sciences. With a little study in different motifs, you can understand what symbols or pictorial roots are used in their culture. The role of the subject in each scientific and artistic field has a different definition and concept, but basically, at the core of all definitions and fields, it is ultimately the concept of modeling.\nThis is the pattern of the old materials of the historical places of Iran that I have photographed.\n\n",

From the point of view of symmetry, a regular zigzag can be generated from a simple motif like a line segment by repeated application of a glide reflection.\n\nAnother name for the pattern is \"Herringbone\" FYI 🤓\n\nThere's a chance no lines are shown at all, this is intentional, as I love \"bugs\" 🪲\n\n⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃\nKeys\n⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃\n\n[b] toggle border\n[n] toggle noise\n[h] generate high res version\n[s] save image\n\n⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃\nEducation - back to 1994\n⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃\n\nZig and Zag are also 2 puppets, have a look here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_and_Zag_(puppets)\nThere's this amazing song if you don't know called \"Zig & Zag - Them Girls Them Girls\".\nYou can view it on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bv_36P_f-w\n\n⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃\nSpecial thanks\n⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃\n\nLiam Egan, for helping me with noise through a shader\n\n⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃\nRoyalties on secondary\n⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃⌄⌃\n\n40% Liam Egan\n40% Obi\n20% WTBS",

Gradually that project morphed into this strange hybrid of indie posters, zodiac killer messages and what AI might do to the whole thing. If it were unleashed on it. This collection - I prefer to call my art a collection - includes some palettes inspired by influential fxhash projects as well as mixes of my own.\n\nThemes here can be pretty dark. I've struggled with suicidal ideation in the past and while it seems like it might be a faux pas to put the words suicide and death in these works, I felt I needed to stay true to me and the darkness that tends to walk side by side with the sunny man I often appear to be.\n\nIf you struggle with similar issues, please go and speak to someone. It has helped me immensely.\n\nfxhash asked everyone to try and make some donations to worthy causes.\n\nI chose Processing Foundation - since their code work has been so helpful to this community.

It seemed fitting to return to this concept for my anniversary mint and recreate it anew, employing many of the skills I have learned over the last year.\n\nIt has some fun interaction...\n\nMouse click in the centre of a hexagon to rotate that hexagon.\nHexagons have 1,2,3 or 6 unique rotations.\n\nOn the keyboard:\n'c' to regenerate the work with the colours of the palette rotated\n'r' to recreate the work with re-randomised hexagons\n't' to change the edge tiles so that the complete image becomes a seamlessly tiling rectangle\n'y' to generate a symmetrical image with the same scale and colour palette - this will use different hexagons from the original image and any further interaction will act on the original image, not the symmetrical pattern, which almost certainly won't tile\n\nkeys 2 through 9 to render at increasing resolutions\n\n's' to save a .png of the current canvas\n\n26 palettes with random rotations + 12 unique hexagons + 10 hexagon combinations + lots of scale and layout possibilities = virtual infinity\n\nCreated with p5.js",

            "description": "This collection of low resolution generative art is presented using emojis rather than an image, so it can be copied like normal text. You are also welcome to take a screenshot for sharing or printing. Most results are designed to fit in a 280 character tweet, except for rare extra large variants. There are five different generative algorithms possible, each with their own set of parameters. Emojis are rendered using the Twemoji font and may look different in some environments.\n\nThank you for supporting my work during the first year of fxhash. For me it has been a life changing experience. I am forever grateful for all of the art and friendships we've created. Many of us have met on social media, so I developed this special project with a fun way to display and share. Congrats to artists, collectors, and developers for an amazing year!\n\nThis work is part of the fxhash anniversary event (#fxhashturnsone)\nAll of primary sale proceeds will go to Save Pakistan\n\nCode and Outputs are Copyright 2022 Frank Force\nArtwork is released under CC BY-NC 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0)\nTwemoji Graphics licensed under CC-BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)",
