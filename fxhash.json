            "description": "Roll the dice with shapes and capture the moment! \nEst follows Iacta which follows Alea. So here we are now: alea iacta est.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach Est consists of 64 objects randomly arranged around a center and randomly differing in shape, size, texture, and movement. A curated 6 colors palette is picked and used for the textures. The color palette is sorted by hue, luminosity and/or colorfulness based on the color reference and direction variables.\n\nThe animation itself is 32 frames long and stops abruptly. It consists of 3 layers. The first layer moves the objects around the center and draws the animated objects displacing vertex positions and textures coordinates based on modulated sinus waves. Textures are additionally dithered based on a randomized fake 6x6 bayer dither matrix.\n\nThe second layer uses the first one and a double buffer to capture the motion blur based on a depth mask.\n\nThe third layer is mainly used for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks. In addition, postprocessing is performed by shifting the drawing position based on color and center distance.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- shapes [3] (more s, more m, more l)\n- palette [102] (based on YPS magazine covers (Germany), issues 700-750 / 800-850, published 1989 - 1992)\n- color sort direction [2] (up, down)\n- color sort reference [3] (0, 1, 2) - sorting mode selection\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 32 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar to trigger a rotation animation (or single click / tap)\n- o to trigger random object change animation followed by a rotation animation (or double click / tap)\n- r to trigger a random feature change followed by a random object change and rotation animation (or triple click / tap)\n- k to enable the kiosk mode and set the speed (off, 3, 5 or 10 secs)\n- m to set the kiosk mode (animate, objects, features (default), special)\n- s to toggle the postprocessing screen mode (default, raw, alternative, rasterized, facetes, lineblocks, all) - experimental\n- c to capture an image\n- f for full screen mode\n- h to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- size=8000 - sets the base size for width/height to 8000px (default 3000, useful if you want to capture bigger pngs)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=5 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- kioskmode=animate - set the kiosk mode (animate, objects, features (default), special)\n- screenmode=default - set the postprocessing screen mode (default, raw, alternative, rasterized, facetes, lineblocks, all) - experimental\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

            "description": "“Allan McCollum’s Plaster Surrogates was a thought-provoking series of sculptures that examines the role of art in contemporary society. The sculptures are cast from plaster and painted to resemble frames, mats, and black rectangles, creating a visual illusion of empty picture frames. McCollum's intention with the surrogates was to comment on the mass production and consumption of art objects, as well as the way in which art is often valued for its social function rather than its inherent aesthetic qualities.”\n\nContinuing the integration of generative art and conceptual art, this work is a digital reproduction and inspiration of Plaster Surrogates - 1982 by noted conceptual artist, Allan McCollum.\n\nEven though the original work had completely black rectangles, in this work, contrasting colors are used in some variations to increase the beauty. The dimensions and colors of the frames are calculated according to McCollum's original work. Various color palettes and canvas sizes have been used.\n\n-----------\n\nNo images are used, created entirely by coding. Textures such as wood, canvas, and oil paint have been created to create a realistic look. Preview optimized for fxhash capturing system and full rendering can take up to several minutes, so I highly recommend checking out this artwork in high quality.\n\n\nTo save the artwork in high resolution, Open it in the live mode, it will be saved automatically after completion.\n\nMade with p5js.",

            "description": "“Allan McCollum’s Plaster Surrogates was a thought-provoking series of sculptures that examines the role of art in contemporary society. The sculptures are cast from plaster and painted to resemble frames, mats, and black rectangles, creating a visual illusion of empty picture frames. McCollum's intention with the surrogates was to comment on the mass production and consumption of art objects, as well as the way in which art is often valued for its social function rather than its inherent aesthetic qualities.”\n\nContinuing the integration of generative art and conceptual art, this work is a digital reproduction and inspiration of Plaster Surrogates - 1982 by noted conceptual artist, Allan McCollum.\n\nEven though the original work had completely black rectangles, in this work, contrasting colors are used in some variations to increase the beauty. The dimensions and colors of the frames are calculated according to McCollum's original work. Various color palettes and canvas sizes have been used.\n\n-----------\n\nNo images are used, created entirely by coding. Textures such as wood, canvas, and oil paint have been created to create a realistic look. Preview optimized for fxhash capturing system and full rendering can take up to several minutes, so I highly recommend checking out this artwork in high quality.\n\n\nTo save the artwork in high resolution, Open it in the live mode, it will be saved automatically after completion.\n\nMade with p5js.",

            "description": "NEBELWALD is the first series of about 10 different tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years. \n\nThis project explores a minimalist approach to tree naturalism using a recursive algorithm and includes three traits: a density layer of fog, a measure of tree growth, and the softness of snowfall.\n\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png.\n\nArtist notes:\n\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nOnce I experienced it in a dense fog, which was amazing! beautiful and mysterious at the same time. This has definitely inspired the NEBELWALD work series.\n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: http://lumicon.de/e-art/project/nebelwald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND\n",
