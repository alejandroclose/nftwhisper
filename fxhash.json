            "description": "Kintsugi is a philosophy, it's the concept of highlighting imperfections, visualizing patches and seams on the area to focus on, rather than focusing on missing details.\n\nThis art of precious scars is a technique used as a means of analyzing the idea of ​​loss through synthesis and restoration of the destroyed and a metaphor for the possibility of rebirth.\nRecovery from destructive events is possible through care and patching, not through hiding the damage, but by accepting a new state of the object or the whole life.\nThe world is a vase that is endlessly disassembled and sewn together again, continuing to bear traces of each event.\n\nNon-human entities helped us put these vases together. In the beginning, there were vague forms, these were the shards themselves, created in collaboration with Latent Diffusion. Over time, they have grown in detail, drawing their stories more clearly, thanks to Jax Diffusion.\n\nThe code that puts everything together was written by Yulikolay, for which he is greatly appreciated.",

            "description": "RAUSCH is a series of generative artworks that explore imaginary digital architectures. \n\nThis series challenges traditional notions of architectural representation and raises important questions about the role of resolution in design. Just as the pixel resolution of an image affects its perceived quality, the resolution of an architectural space can affect its qualities and livability. By embracing digital variation through codes, this series explores the interplay between abstract and concrete space through multiple resolutions. \n\nRAUSCH is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by complex, chaotic and messy sensations, and aims to engage the viewer through a sense of wonder, disorientation, and awe.\n\nReleased on the occasion of Companions of Code, a group exhibition by VerticalCrypto Art at The NFT Gallery in London. \nCurated by Micol Ap. Exhibition 10-24 February 2023 \n\n___________________________________________________\nRAUSCH Controls:\n\nAnimation: \n• ‘1 - 2 - 3 - 4’ animate views\n• 'MouseClick' pause/play animation\n\nFunctions:\n(press key & wait)\n• 'F' 24 FPS\n• 'B' b/w mode \n\nResize Canvas:\n(press key & wait)\n• '6' Portrait A4 - 1000x1414\n• '7' Landscape 16:9 - 1920x1080\n• '8' Portrait 9:16 - 1080x1920\n• '9' Square 1:1 - 1024x1024\n• 'DoubleClick' Fullscreen\n\nSave & Export Image:\n• 'S' save a .png of in current resolution\n\nSave & Export GIF:\n• 'G' save a 1-2 sec. seamless loop .gif of current view \n• 'P' save a 12-24 sec. seamless loop .gif of all the views\n• 'T’ scale down current resolution, save a 12 sec. seamless loop .gif\n\nSteps to save a gif/png :\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• resize canvas with 6,7,8, or 9 to your desired aspect ratio (wait)\n• press S,G or P to save & download (wait) \n• enjoy RAUSCH :)\n\nSave & Export GIF for social media sharing:\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• press T or G wait for recalculation & download. \n• enjoy RAUSCH \n• post on Twitter ;)\n__________________________________________________\n\nThis token may not work on mobile(!), but it allows exporting .png and .gif (see controls) to enjoy RAUSCH on different displays or mobile.

            "description": "The existing nature grows on the unexisting spirits.\n\nGenerative sketch, based on the pen and ink drawings of Po Sheng Chen. Po Sheng Chen is an Architect who has drawn nothing but Architecture for over 25 years. He tried to explore something different from his previous style (Brutalism with Magical Realism), so developed his own Minimalist Architecture process and style. After breaking up all the complicated elements and symbols, he chose a simple and naive way to present “pure volumes in the space (the essential of Architecture)”: the Use of different densities of vertical lines to create different faces of volumes, with the addition of horizontal lines to create shadows on the volumes. Shadow determined the form of volumes, then they became a clear composition in the space, Eliminating chaos. These lines seem like spirits to Po Sheng Chen, because they represent the soul of Architecture, but they do not have a specific form or meaning...they are between existing and unexisting! Tezumie is a creative generative artist. He saw the latest experimental drawings of Po Sheng Chen, and after reaching out, the collab was formed with the goal of creating a digital representation of the original concept surrounded by a natural and overgrown environment. The combination of nature and architecture.\n\nMade in p5js.\n",

Where some specific types of tulips flowers reached excessive prices in the market, creating the first speculative bubble of the modern era. \n\nAs an ironic homage to this curious event, I made a digital re-interpretation of the catalogues (beautifully handmade and illustrated by the way) that were used during that era to buy and sell those flowers. \n\nThis project consisted of 130 types of bulbs that I draw digitally with 30 color possibilities, with a combination of 15x15 sets of keywords related to the crypto/nft imaginary, 2 kind of paper textures, 6 types of green leaves and 6 types of mounds. This allow a possible combination of tens of millions of flowers, but as this is all about scarcity (does’n it?) the possible iterations will be limited to 80 exclusive results. \n\nDon't miss the tulipmania!\n\n",

As new memories form, the older ones become obscured, fuzzy, or joined with others to form belief structures and intuitions. I hope that this work will remind you of someone, someplace, a song or a melody that’s important to you. \n\nKeyboard controls:\n[S] Save the current view in live mode.\n[1] to [8] Change resolution, 1.5K to 12K.\n[G] Toggle paper texture.\n\nURL params:\naspect: custom aspect ratio (?aspect=3).\nres: custom resolution multiplier (?res=4).\n\nMade with fractal math and p5js, Memory Module is the first in a 5-part generative art series about introspection. You can read more about the series here: https://elsifthen.github.io/\n\nCreated by elsif, 2022.07.",

According to legend, an ancient civilization of high intelligence, called the Explorers of Latent Space, distributed hundreds of monoliths throughout time and space in order to study the behavior of species in the infinite Universe.\n\nSome say that it is the divine intelligence of God. Others say that, in spite of their objectual and material condition, the monoliths possess their own consciousness and an intelligence beyond the natural and artificial. Their purpose or objective, to this day, remains a mystery.\n\n_-_-_-_-_-_-_-_\n\nthis work is done only with code, using threejs and p5js\nit might be a bit slow on low-end devices, be patient",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

Looking back at the scores of our lives, the notations are never neatly noted, but fully felt.  Rewinding the songs of life are our memories, whether sad, happy, angry, or melancholy. It is not clear whether I am dreaming or awake, but our songs all do end. \n\nIn this final drop (for ?), I have reused the first ever class calligraphy(){} I have written from my genesis drop “Nothing comes from nothing”. As time passes, 10 drops later, across almost to the year, I am grateful for the progress I have made, as an artist, and more importantly as a human. After all, what is behind the code of generative art is a human being. \n\nScores of music, scrolls of calligraphy, calendar or diary, notating life, time passes, and changes are inevitable. Sometimes we sing louder in laughter and joy, sometimes we scribble in uneasiness, sometimes we just get lost in neon lights. Life goes on. You and me, all the same and yet different.  \n\nThere are too many friend artists, friend collectors, fxhash team members, to thank for helping me through this journey. I would like to pay homage to Rudxane in this work, who has taken me under his wings, mentoring and encouraging me in art as well as showing me some degen stuff on the side:-). This homage is not copy-minting, or copying of styles, which I do not have the coding skills to do so even if I wanted to. But it is the influence of taste in many works of Rudxane. In a vague but agreeable taste, I present to you Life has no scores. \n\nWhat I was taught was disrupted, and grid studies left unfinished, and oh do we have a BINGO?\n\nTested on Chrome.
