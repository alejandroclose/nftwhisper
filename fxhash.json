            "description": "menToll was inspired by a series of OP Art paintings done by Victor Vasarely, called Toll (from the Permutations Series). (c. 1965) Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the fifth in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nmenToll is two layered piece. A 2x2 array of arrays of circles contained within a background square. A similar sized array of squares (with no background of its own) is superimposed and centered on top. Each array of circles with a square has an opacity gradient applied to it allowing its uniquely colored random background to show through its elements. The superimposed top layer of squares is a solid random color.\n\nThere are many Gestalt interactions within this piece. Circle groups within each of their containers interact with each other, and their background, in interesting ways. Each new generation with its random color assignments significantly affects your depth perception. The top layer appears to come forward or recede depending on the layer it overlaps. And depending on color combinations there is a variety of \"after-imagism\" interactions between the squares in the top set. More candy for your mind.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "\"Herbarium\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022\n\nOccasionally, I stumble upon vintage scientific illustrations on various topics, exotically looking charts and graphs, alternative layouts for the periodic tables or psychological research diagrams, elaborate illustrations of botany and zoology, minerals, and natural and sometimes unnatural phenomena. Most of those illustrations are part of the \"art and science\" practices from the 18th and 19th centuries. At the core of those practices were observation and interpretation, unraveling complexity through visualizing abstract ideas or finding a creative approach for understanding previously incomprehensible forms. \n\nI'm an admirer of two female pioneers in the field. Maria Sibylla Merian created, with immense dedication, a book with intricate illustrations of plants and insects, later praised by scientists. On the other hand, Anna Atkins published a book with beautiful botanical cyanotypes, considered the first book with photographic images. These topics are the visual inspiration for pieces presented at ArtBasel HK. \n\nMy mathematical background makes me naturally attracted to graphs, converting numbers to curves, and everything schematically displayed. Also, combining scientific symbols and illustrations with imaginary data inspires the spectator to find meaning in unrelated or random things or provokes latent skepticism towards assumed concepts of truth, reality, and knowledge.

So, I named the algorithm 'Kralen', which means 'beads' in Dutch.\n\nThe algorithm 'Kralen' creates random bezier curves using the edges of a rectangular boundary, and places beads atop these curves to create a 'bead maze' effect. The algorithm offers different curve creation modes, with the most common mode being 'Mix'. In this mode, two random edges of the boundary are chosen to form bezier curves. Other modes create curves that are horizontally or vertically oriented, or formed using only the corners of the boundary\n\n---\n\nThe work is created with p5.js with the help of bezier.js for working with bezier curves.",

            "description": "The outputs created by this algorithm reminded me of the colourful bead mazes that children play with. So, I named the algorithm 'Kralen', which means 'beads' in Dutch.\n\nThe algorithm 'Kralen' creates random bezier curves using the edges of a rectangular boundary, and places beads atop these curves to create a 'bead maze' effect. The algorithm offers different curve creation modes, with the most common mode being 'Mix'. In this mode, two random edges of the boundary are chosen to form bezier curves. Other modes create curves that are horizontally or vertically oriented, or formed using only the corners of the boundary\n\n---\n\nThe work is created with p5.js with the help of bezier.js for working with bezier curves.",
