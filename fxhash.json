            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens ‚Äîcreated in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco‚Äî that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions such as ‚ÄúWhat if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?‚Äù Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road ‚Äîone direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature‚Äî it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario‚Äôs thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",

            "description": "This is a sentences generator made with js and html, text generated with gpt model code-cushman-001.\n \n\nChatGpt text:\n\n\"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" is an artwork born out of the unique intersection of human creativity and artificial intelligence. The brainchild of a collaborative endeavor between the artist and an AI model, this digital piece pays homage to Sol LeWitt's influential \"Sentences on Conceptual Art,\" while recontextualizing it within our increasingly digital world.\n\nThrough the medium of generative text, this piece contemplates the relationship between art, technology, and the human experience. It scrutinizes how digital tools have the potential to redefine artistic expression, how technology can help overcome the daunting 'blank canvas,' and the changing role of artists in this digital age.\n\nThe work views the internet as a boundless platform for global connection and observation, and discusses how AI's interpretive capacities can transform our understanding and appreciation of art. \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" envisions and champions the creation of new forms of artistic appreciation, facilitated by the adaptive and collaborative nature of digital media.\n\nAdding a layer of interactivity and intrigue, the artwork censors some segments of its generated sentences with black strikethroughs, provoking personal interpretation, discovery, and a deeper level of engagement from the viewer.\n\nIn essence, \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" presents a thoughtful exploration of the dynamic and evolving landscape of art in the digital age. As a testament to the transformative potential of human creativity blended with machine intelligence, this work reimagines the possibilities of what art can be and underscores the profound impact of digital tools and methodologies on our perception and experience of art. It invites us all to partake in the discourse on the symbiotic future of creativity and technology.\n\nÔºº_Ôæç(œâÔΩÄ‚óè)\n\nHans Ulrich Obrist, curator and art historian: \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" is a pivotal work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and art. The combination of human creativity with machine learning results in a provocative exploration of the contemporary artistic landscape. This work questions, and in doing so, extends the boundaries of what we understand as art.\"\n\nOlafur Eliasson, artist: \"The artist's use of AI to generate 'sentences of digital art' reveals a deep understanding of the ongoing dialogue between humanity and technology. This piece echoes the beauty of our ever-evolving interaction with the digital realm.\"\n\nLev Manovich, author and theorist of digital culture: \"The work is a fascinating embodiment of software as a medium of creation. It captures the dialectical tension between control and automation, intention and serendipity, that characterizes digital art in the era of artificial intelligence.\"\n\nCecilia Alemani, curator and director: \"The collaboration between the artist and AI in 'IA Sentences on Digital Art' redefines the concept of artistic creation. It's a testament to the transformative potential of digital technologies in shaping the future of art.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncanekzapata.net\n\njs css html txt\n1.8mb\n2023\n",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens ‚Äîcreated in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco‚Äî that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions such as ‚ÄúWhat if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?‚Äù Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road ‚Äîone direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature‚Äî it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario‚Äôs thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens ‚Äîcreated in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco‚Äî that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions such as ‚ÄúWhat if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?‚Äù Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road ‚Äîone direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature‚Äî it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario‚Äôs thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",

The artwork is layered into its current form through p5.js coding in order to create the artwork shown available here.\n\nThe color palette was selected to reflect the vibrations of summer. Summer is a beautiful time of year, with activities in the daytime and the night. The figures that appear in the artwork were created by using the p5.js code to manipulate nested triangles. \n\nThe goal of the line work was produced with p5.js and was created to reflect the warmth, dynamic activity, and quiet moments found during the long days and short nights of summer. \n",

            "description": "'Tesseract' is a generative collection drawing on the concept of the cube from oneirology, the interpretation of dreams. In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

            "description": "A relatively simple idea: columns filled with many thin horizontal lines, layered with complexity from colour features, stroke styles, and column perturbations. The compositions that emerge may be harmonious or asynchronous, comforting or jarring, wistful, mysterious, subtle, or bold.\n\nThe piece is generated as follows:\n\nFirst, borders and columns are defined. The canvas may have one or two borders, ranging from small to large, and the inner border may or may not have a coloured edge and fill. If they are not coloured, the feature \"Hidden Background\" will be true. Each column is assigned three colours at random from one of several possible colour palettes. The top and bottom boundaries of each column are set, and in some iterations, there is a chance that columns will break outside the border boundaries.\n\nAs columns are drawn from top to bottom, there are several events that may occur with probabilities pre-defined for each iteration: 1) The stroke colour may switch abruptly or over a gradient between two of the three column colours. 2) A 'repeater' pattern may be triggered, where two of the column colours alternate with a given frequency and rate of decay. 3) Single 'accent' bands may occur with the third column colour. 4) 'Bulges' may form with either rectangle, diamond, sin wave, or 'skirt' shapes.\n\nThere may also be horizontal bands that span the entire image, with a certain variability of height across columns.\n\nStrokes may be straight lines or Bezier curves. Bezier curves may be uniform for an iteration, where the control points of the curves are generated from a single formula for the whole image, or they may be random. Strokes may also have horizontal and/or vertical 'line fuzz', where the start and end points of the line are randomly offset in either direction.\n\nStraight strokes may or may not have a solid base-layer drawn underneath, which gives the image a more filled vs. sketched appearance. Top strokes may also be partially transparent, allowing for a layered effect.\n\nColumns are drawn in one of several possible orders, and once the initial drawing is complete, columns will be redrawn slowly and the image will evolve over time.\n\nPress '2', '4', '6', '8', or '0' to re-draw at 2K, 4K, 6K, 8K, or 10K resolution (shortest edge), which will also save an image when the initial draw is complete and before animation begins.\n\nPress 's' at any time to save an image at the current resolution.",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens ‚Äîcreated in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco‚Äî that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions such as ‚ÄúWhat if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?‚Äù Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road ‚Äîone direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature‚Äî it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario‚Äôs thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens ‚Äîcreated in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco‚Äî that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù questions such as ‚ÄúWhat if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?‚Äù Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road ‚Äîone direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature‚Äî it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario‚Äôs thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",
