            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

It lasts an instant, then the particles start to move again according to oneiric patterns, they disaggregate the poem, then recompose a new one after one hour. \n\nAll the generative poems are different, but all Adagios in the world are synchronized and obey the same strict temporal rules: at the same absolute universal time they stop building the poem and an instant later they start destroying it. It also means that each day, a single Adagio will show exactly the same image at the same time. Forever and ever.\n\nThe generated verses follow rules of classical poetic metrics (accentual-syllabic rhythm): each poem is an octave composed of blank iambic pentameters, except  the first three verses, which are anapestic tetrameters emphasizing the slow rhythm of the past. A single work of art concerns a single real-life object and will show 24 poems on the theme of the relationship of that object with time. \n\n\nDuring the animation you can save to a file the current frame, by pressing the \"s\" key.",

            "description": "Colour streaks refer to vibrant and bold streaks of different colors, which involve creating vibrant and dynamic combinations using streaks or lines of different colors. Characterized by their bold and energetic appearance, colors are often combined and layered to create a sense of movement and depth.\nDifferent techniques are usually used to apply colors on canvas or paper. This can include brush strokes, palette knives, or even pouring paint directly onto the surface. Colors are usually applied in long, flowing strokes, creating a sense of flow and rhythm.\nColors have a great influence on the mood and overall effect of the artwork. I chose complementary colors to create contrast and visual interest, and similar colors for a more harmonious and relaxing effect.\nOne of the key aspects of colour streaks is their ability to evoke emotion and stimulate the viewer's imagination. Vibrant colors and dynamic combinations often evoke feelings of joy, energy, or excitement. Flowing lines and color combinations can also create a sense of movement or evoke natural elements such as water or wind.\nOverall, colour streaks are a visually appealing form of abstract expression that celebrates the beauty and power of color. They invite viewers to immerse themselves in their vibrant world and interpret their meaning based on their own perceptions and feelings.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "Colour streaks refer to vibrant and bold streaks of different colors, which involve creating vibrant and dynamic combinations using streaks or lines of different colors. Characterized by their bold and energetic appearance, colors are often combined and layered to create a sense of movement and depth.\nDifferent techniques are usually used to apply colors on canvas or paper. This can include brush strokes, palette knives, or even pouring paint directly onto the surface. Colors are usually applied in long, flowing strokes, creating a sense of flow and rhythm.\nColors have a great influence on the mood and overall effect of the artwork. I chose complementary colors to create contrast and visual interest, and similar colors for a more harmonious and relaxing effect.\nOne of the key aspects of colour streaks is their ability to evoke emotion and stimulate the viewer's imagination. Vibrant colors and dynamic combinations often evoke feelings of joy, energy, or excitement. Flowing lines and color combinations can also create a sense of movement or evoke natural elements such as water or wind.\nOverall, colour streaks are a visually appealing form of abstract expression that celebrates the beauty and power of color. They invite viewers to immerse themselves in their vibrant world and interpret their meaning based on their own perceptions and feelings.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

It involves creating intricate and vibrant designs using bubbles as generative art.\nThe process begins by mixing a special solution that creates long-lasting and colorful bubbles.

As the bubbles interact with each other, they create stunning patterns and shapes.\nI manipulated the direction, colors, and movement of the bubbles using live patterns and directed them across the canvas to create dynamic compositions.\nWhen the bubbles merge, they leave a vibrant trail, creating unique textures and patterns on the canvas. The result is a captivating work of art that comes alive with its own fluidity and movement.\nDancing bubbles are visually appealing, but they also evoke joy and playfulness. It captures the fleeting nature of bubbles and reminds us to appreciate beautiful moments that are fleeting yet magical.\nThis art form can be enjoyed in various settings, including galleries, exhibitions, or even live performances in aquariums decorated with colored lights.
