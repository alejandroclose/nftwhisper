It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

            "description": "Welcome all of you on the official I'm a giraffe project page We are a budding team of NFT artists.\nOur goal with NFT is to present our creativity, build a community and make this world a better place together. We are very concerned about global problems, such as the garbage crisis in low-income countries and global warming, which causes environmental degradation, the disappearance of rare species and animals. Overpopulation and starvation of millions of people. It feels like the whole world is gradually going to hell.\nAnd of course, wars stand out from all of this. We felt this especially when our country went to war with one of the most powerful armies in the world. And it led to thousands of tragedies and casualties. We realized that enough sitting in one place and dreaming about how to make the world a better place, it's time to act! Even though we are ordinary artists, we want to try to do something with the powers available to us. We believe that the NFT community and culture can help us in this. We decided to start making the world a better place with the problem of wars that touched us personally.\nThat's why we have created the NFT collection of giraffes, which we want to make a symbol of the struggle of Ukraine. 50% from all sales of the collection will go for the reconstruction of Ukraine and help to the victims. We love our country and people living in it. We want more people to know better about Ukraine and its artists. We are going to cooperate with Ukrainian NFT artists, buy their works and publish them here for public viewing. It will take 15% of all sales. But not only Ukrainians will be able to participate in our program. Every 100 sales, we'll have a giveaway where we'll spend 15% of the proceeds to buy your NFTs, and give them away to the rest of our NFT holders. This is our first project, and we have many goals. After we sell our first collection, we are going to tackle other global issues and develop more of an NFT culture. What we do next depends on the success of our collection. Join us and together we will change the world!\ntwitter @Im_a_giraffe0",

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. \nwww.tribute-hwf.com\n\n“One criterion for art involves the process used by the artist for shaping the work. In the special case of mathematically supported fine art, the artmaking process occurs in a mathematically defined operation that allows the generation and transformation of images, methods used for picture processing.” - Herbert W. Franke\n\nI first came across Franke’s ‘Ornamental Alphabets’ in his book 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘎𝘳𝘢𝘱𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘴 - 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘈𝘳𝘵, and was intrigued with the idea of using a simple letterform to explore different generative image processing techniques. \n\nI’ve used letters and writing in my work for a long time, both with letterpress printing and in my asemic poetry programs. With asemic writing, I generate unrecognizable letters to reference text, and here I use recognizable letterforms removed from their typical function as language signifiers. \n\nMy goal with this project was to build as much texture and layering as possible by warping and collaging the letters together in various ways. The font I’m using is a design I made years ago to supplement my wood type collection for printing. I really enjoyed being able to bring that part of my past work into my generative art practice. \n\nEach image is composed of the letters found in the hash for that piece, divided into either vowels or consonants. The program builds on a technique I’ve used before, where I generate an image to an off-screen canvas and then dive through the pixels to pull out the color and form I want to surface in the final image.\n\n25% of the primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke. These funds will be used by ZKM Karlsruhe to digitize Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any additional funds raised will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n- Press “R” to increase the pixel density and reload the image (this can be render intensive and will create a really large file suitable for printing)\n- Press “S” to save a copy\n\nMade with p5js\nArtist: Sarah Ridgley\nOctober, 2022",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px). It may last for high numbers.\nWe recommend the use of Chrome browser in order to render properly the texture.\n\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 × 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.net",

Together though, they are stronger than ever. So yes, Midfile Crisis is a love story, too.\n\n-\n\nProcedural , ever changing real-time animation, October 2022\nJavascript and WebGL\n\n-\n\nFEATURES\n\n- 6 color palettes, inspired by recent artworks by Xenia Hausner, Ayako Rokkaku, Jenny Saville, Amy Sherald, Sue Williams and Emily Xie, are referenced accordingly. One additional, rare color palette will slowly cycle through the full color spectrum.\n- Direction: Up, Right, Up Right\n- Seed: Up, Right, Up Left\n- Shape Tendency: Tetra, Box, Sphere, Octa, Ico, Multi\n- Amount: Low, Medium, High\n\nVIEWING\n\n- The artwork is in landscape format, please click on open to see the full frame and resolution. We recommend rotating your screen on mobile.\n- Press 'i' to show artwork title and features.\n- Press 's' to save an image.\n- To guarantee the same output at different resolutions the simulation driving the artwork is locked at 1024x512 pixels. To unlock, press 'u' - this can help when running at a lower resolution and the animation is not smooth, or when running at significanly higher resolutions and pixelation is starting to occur. Please note this will break the deterministic nature of the work.\n- Best viewed in Chrome Desktop with dedicated GPU.\n- Please note: requires latest devices (supporting WebGL2) for a smooth experience.\n",
