            "description": "Sol is a companion project that complements my recent series, Metamorphosis. Both projects share a common foundation - a cellular automata engine. The state of each cell in a new generation is influenced by its own state as well as those of its neighboring cells from the last generation. The rules guiding these state transitions, however, are dynamic.\n\nSol for me is an experimental plotter project. As a gesture of my gratitude to minters of Metamorphosis, all minters will be on the reserve list for a free piece of Sol. I’ll take a snapshot of Metamorphosis for the reserve list 30 minutes prior to Sol’s launch. For three days (unless all reserve-holders mint sooner), Sol will be only for those on the reserve list and I'll add anyone who purchases Metamorphosis on primary subsequently. After this period, any remaining pieces, along with an additional 50 mints, will be available for public sale.\n\nA Note on the Name: The inspiration behind the name 'Sol' springs from my visits to SF MoMA, where I always find myself in the space dedicated to Sol LeWitt. Through the repetition and variation of a singular concept, LeWitt constructed forms that were striking, often evolving from basic geometric forms into intricate structures. The same is also echoed in the principle of emergence in cellular automata, where complex systems arise from the interactions of simple components governed by rules. This series, Sol, is a homage to LeWitt's ingenuity in favoring dispassionate geometric forms over the emotionally-infused abstract art styles.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

            "description": "This project uses cellular automata where the state of a cell in a new generation is determined based on its own and its neighbors' states in the previous generation. The guiding rules for these transitions, however, are not static; they undergo a random change every few generations, chosen from a possible 256 rules. By also slightly shifting the positions of cells and using an outline and texture that conveys a hand-drawn style, I have tried introducing an element of organic randomness.\n\nStepping away from the monochromatic color scheme used in my last three series, I have used a gradient effect to convey a transitioning hue across generations, combining a palette of two colors selected from an array of 14 different palettes. \n\nNote on the name: The alternating rules and fluctuating cell positions serve as the apparent justification for its name. However, a subtler inspiration lies in my deep admiration for Franz Kafka and his remarkable short story, \"The Metamorphosis\". Kafka’s narrative explores the constantly evolving state of human existence, where patterns appear momentarily only to dissipate quickly. Just when you think you've spotted a pattern, poof, it changes. Just like in life, right :)\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

            "description": "This project uses cellular automata where the state of a cell in a new generation is determined based on its own and its neighbors' states in the previous generation. The guiding rules for these transitions, however, are not static; they undergo a random change every few generations, chosen from a possible 256 rules. By also slightly shifting the positions of cells and using an outline and texture that conveys a hand-drawn style, I have tried introducing an element of organic randomness.\n\nStepping away from the monochromatic color scheme used in my last three series, I have used a gradient effect to convey a transitioning hue across generations, combining a palette of two colors selected from an array of 14 different palettes. \n\nNote on the name: The alternating rules and fluctuating cell positions serve as the apparent justification for its name. However, a subtler inspiration lies in my deep admiration for Franz Kafka and his remarkable short story, \"The Metamorphosis\". Kafka’s narrative explores the constantly evolving state of human existence, where patterns appear momentarily only to dissipate quickly. Just when you think you've spotted a pattern, poof, it changes. Just like in life, right :)\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

            "description": "🔥 BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY \"open edition\" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",
