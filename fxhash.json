            "description": "Timeless... a word that makes time indescribable. I want to talk about that point in space and time that seems endless, where past, present, and future are intertwined. In a space where endless time and rivers flow, without beginning and without end, always flowing and at the same moment, not recorded and not forgotten. In the period when the earth speaks of itself with a call of love and passion in every moment of life. When the heart sinks into the past, each emotion has its people. Here, feelings, thoughts, and ideas shine in an endless beam of time, each drop of which has a deep immersion in the vast sea of the past and experiences. A place where borders are erased and people connect with the earth. That bright spot in time and place reminds us that we are all part of a bigger story. Events that are connected from beginning to end are always ongoing and have eternity and beauty. From thousands of years ago until today, nature has shown endless displays of its special beauty. I want to talk about its sedimentary textures and its various colors, signs of an infinite path of time, and natural changes that have affected it, and each piece of it tells a mysterious story of its journey through time; From its formation in the depths of the seas and rivers to the emergence on the surface of the earth. A natural miracle, which, with its beauty, draws us to a world of greatness and wonder. Grooves that scream from the depths of time remind us that everything in this world is an infinite and beautiful journey, and we are part of this great world.\nPerhaps it is a symbol of beauty and stability in the stone world. Wonders that tell us about the distant past. It begins when the universe began to form and continues to this day. This geological formation, which was formed millions of years ago, is a masterpiece of earth maps that takes us to distant, complicated, and adventurous times. Textures of sedimentary rocks that preserve their beauty and special patterns tell a story of the journey of nature's superpower. Thin layers of blue, green, and red stones, make a valuable past for us; From water currents, solar eclipses, and deep underground fun.\nAnd finally, I conclude that the earth is an infinite museum of beauty and history. Each layer of this formation tells us a new chapter of the greatness of the world. A story that continues to this day and always fascinates us by watching his works.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

They are portals opening our view to rich content.\n\nThis work is a portal to itself. It loads itself within itself 20 times. It's not pretty, it reminds us of WordArt, it's a little bit hacky, it might break when our tools to display HTML will change. But it's a proof that the limits of our tools are only limits until creativity breaks them.\n\nThis work is not purely deterministic, because it simply cannot be. Slight timing differences due to loading times being different each time an <iframe> is loaded will make each visualization slightly unique.\n\nIf you view this token on mobile, the nesting limit was reduced to 4 to prevent performance issues.\n\nThis work is highly experimental. It leverages a \"hack\" to allow iframes to be nested.\nFirefox max <iframe> nesting depth as of 28/12/2021 is capped at 9.\nWorks with chrome desktop 96.0.4664.110",

            "description": "Polar Grid is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, London 2022.\n\nThis is a study of color, motion, and composition, and an homage to cinema as an artform. Colorful shapes overlap and pulse in a ever repeating dance. An abstracted movie experience. Each color palette in the series (except one) is inspired by a different film director (if you want a real challenge, see how many you can guess without looking at the feature names).\n\nThe palettes were extracted from movie stills or movie posters and fine tuned by hand. As often, I have to thank independent tool makers for their indirect help. My gratitude goes to David Aerne for FarbVélo and Fabrizio Bianchi for Coolors.\n\nThe code for Polar Grid is based on early iterations of what ultimately became my carat series. Both projects come from the same fascination for color as a system, even though I used a different approach here. You could call this a carat prequel.\n\nThe animation is done using a technique called polar noise. This makes it so the motion of all elements ends up repeating in the same amount of time. This is useful for generating motion that loops perfectly while still appearing organic. In this particular case, the animation repeats every π × 100 seconds.\n\nA challenge in building any generative system is to find the right balance between coherence and variety. I designed the system with the large edition size in mind. During development I generated hundreds of iterations and tweaked my code to make sure that every iteration is truly unique and fits the overall aesthetic of the collection.\n\nI truly hope you will enjoy your own little abstract movie.\n\n— Raphaël de Courville\n\n\nReleased: July 6th 2022\n\nMedium: p5.js, html canvas, css\n\nReference: sk220621\n\n\n**About the artist**\n\nRaphaël de Courville is a generative artist, streamer, and educator.

            "description": "Timeless... a word that makes time indescribable. I want to talk about that point in space and time that seems endless, where past, present, and future are intertwined. In a space where endless time and rivers flow, without beginning and without end, always flowing and at the same moment, not recorded and not forgotten. In the period when the earth speaks of itself with a call of love and passion in every moment of life. When the heart sinks into the past, each emotion has its people. Here, feelings, thoughts, and ideas shine in an endless beam of time, each drop of which has a deep immersion in the vast sea of the past and experiences. A place where borders are erased and people connect with the earth. That bright spot in time and place reminds us that we are all part of a bigger story. Events that are connected from beginning to end are always ongoing and have eternity and beauty. From thousands of years ago until today, nature has shown endless displays of its special beauty. I want to talk about its sedimentary textures and its various colors, signs of an infinite path of time, and natural changes that have affected it, and each piece of it tells a mysterious story of its journey through time; From its formation in the depths of the seas and rivers to the emergence on the surface of the earth. A natural miracle, which, with its beauty, draws us to a world of greatness and wonder. Grooves that scream from the depths of time remind us that everything in this world is an infinite and beautiful journey, and we are part of this great world.\nPerhaps it is a symbol of beauty and stability in the stone world. Wonders that tell us about the distant past. It begins when the universe began to form and continues to this day. This geological formation, which was formed millions of years ago, is a masterpiece of earth maps that takes us to distant, complicated, and adventurous times. Textures of sedimentary rocks that preserve their beauty and special patterns tell a story of the journey of nature's superpower. Thin layers of blue, green, and red stones, make a valuable past for us; From water currents, solar eclipses, and deep underground fun.\nAnd finally, I conclude that the earth is an infinite museum of beauty and history. Each layer of this formation tells us a new chapter of the greatness of the world. A story that continues to this day and always fascinates us by watching his works.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

It is the Junkspace.\n\nJunkspace is an algorithm inspired by the well-known namesake article of Rem Koolhaas (October, Vol. 100, Obsolescence. (Spring, 2002), pp. 175-190). The work is a generative approach to visualize it in the plan view. There are several paper types, partitions, floorings, and color palettes to achieve the residue of modernization.\n\nThis work exists thanks to the p5js library.

            "description": "640 unique sketches of imaginary walls, inspired by the work of Norwegian architect Erling Viksjø (1910–1971) and his artist collaborators. Viksjø designed the Government Quarter in Oslo and invited artists from different disciplines to help design the facades and interiors of the buildings.\n\nViksjø’s aim was to “soften” modernist architecture. He invented «Natural Concrete», a type of concrete that deliberately exposes the mixed-in stones on its surface to give it warmth and a human touch. In my work, I have similar ambitions—using code instead of concrete.\n\nThe different styles of the piece are inspired by, and dedicated to some of the artists who worked together with Viksjø: Jakob Weidemann (~2%), Carl Nesjar (~18%), Odd Tandberg (~30%), and Tore Haaland (~50%).\n\nIn live mode, press ‘S’ to save an image at current resolution or ‘P’ to save a high-resolution file at 6000×6000px (this might take a while depending on your hardware).\n\nOriginal artwork by Andreas Rau · Made with p5.js & glsl · Oslo, 2021",

Being here is lonely, even surrounded. It is the debris of modern architecture. It is the uncanny valley of the places. It is the Junkspace.\n\nJunkspace is an algorithm inspired by the well-known namesake article of Rem Koolhaas (October, Vol. 100, Obsolescence. (Spring, 2002), pp. 175-190). The work is a generative approach to visualize it in the plan view. There are several paper types, partitions, floorings, and color palettes to achieve the residue of modernization.\n\nThis work exists thanks to the p5js library.

Within these ancient relics, primitive geometric shapes abound, alongside inscriptions in an enigmatic script. Yet, it is the presence of recursive substructures that confounds researchers, their origins steeped in the  mystery of time. The identity of these ancient architects remains elusive.",

            "description": "Timeless... a word that makes time indescribable. I want to talk about that point in space and time that seems endless, where past, present, and future are intertwined. In a space where endless time and rivers flow, without beginning and without end, always flowing and at the same moment, not recorded and not forgotten. In the period when the earth speaks of itself with a call of love and passion in every moment of life. When the heart sinks into the past, each emotion has its people. Here, feelings, thoughts, and ideas shine in an endless beam of time, each drop of which has a deep immersion in the vast sea of the past and experiences. A place where borders are erased and people connect with the earth. That bright spot in time and place reminds us that we are all part of a bigger story. Events that are connected from beginning to end are always ongoing and have eternity and beauty. From thousands of years ago until today, nature has shown endless displays of its special beauty. I want to talk about its sedimentary textures and its various colors, signs of an infinite path of time, and natural changes that have affected it, and each piece of it tells a mysterious story of its journey through time; From its formation in the depths of the seas and rivers to the emergence on the surface of the earth. A natural miracle, which, with its beauty, draws us to a world of greatness and wonder. Grooves that scream from the depths of time remind us that everything in this world is an infinite and beautiful journey, and we are part of this great world.\nPerhaps it is a symbol of beauty and stability in the stone world. Wonders that tell us about the distant past. It begins when the universe began to form and continues to this day. This geological formation, which was formed millions of years ago, is a masterpiece of earth maps that takes us to distant, complicated, and adventurous times. Textures of sedimentary rocks that preserve their beauty and special patterns tell a story of the journey of nature's superpower. Thin layers of blue, green, and red stones, make a valuable past for us; From water currents, solar eclipses, and deep underground fun.\nAnd finally, I conclude that the earth is an infinite museum of beauty and history. Each layer of this formation tells us a new chapter of the greatness of the world. A story that continues to this day and always fascinates us by watching his works.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",
