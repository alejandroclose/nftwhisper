Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "I try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "According to Kandinsky, painting “can create the same energies in the observer that music can make in the listener. The abstract painter is an echo seeker: just like the relationship between music and the listener, shapes and colors must penetrate the observer's soul. They vibrate the threads of his existence and resonate in the depths of his mind, you can still find references to people, buildings, mountains, etc., but these are more signs than manifestations. They do not evoke objects but abstractly reveal them, like the simplified image we have seen before of objects and elements in nature.\nClassical philosophy reinforces the belief that existing, tangible reality is a mask for a deeper reality that can only be reached through imagination. I have tried to combine this with the art of coding and creating canvases of millions of characters and numbers.\nMade in p5js\nCreated July 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

Either strictly based on time or via a combination of screen coordinates and time.\n\nThe animation can be stopped and started by pressing the space key.\n\nThis is my genesis fx(hash) project.\n\nTwitter: @jeffpalmer\nSite: https://jpalmer.dev",

            "description": "Minima is a study on focus and color. Playing with the idea of a simple composition of semicircles, either rotated up or down. The focus of the observer is moved with the use of gradual animation in the gradients and occasional circles and/or rectangles connecting the shapes together through color.\n\nThe name minima stems from the origins of the composition, mostly taking inspiration from minimalism in its use of a few elements to form a composition greater than the sum of its parts. Less is more, as they say.\n\nThe point at the bottom right of the canvas resembles the end of a sentence. Like reading a book, you process the canvas in a similar way, moving from what pops the most to what the least.\n\nAs the reader of this canvas I hope you observe what happens to your focus as the colors gradually move across the screen. The animations themselves are looping based on a noised sine wave, which gives them imperfections, imperfections you can observe.\n\n----\n\nClick / Tap on the bar at the bottom of the canvas to open up the GUI, used to export your minima into any format you want. Either .png or .svg. Ready for printing, if you desire.\n\nps. there might be a secret keyboard shortcut...\n\n----\n\nMinima,\nWouter Missler, 2022,\np5js + webgl.",

Like a public decentralized hard disk and marketplace all in 1. Hyped, loved and hated; but from the underground and up; all around the world, Artist suddenly are given a platform to directly publish and sell their Art, work together, connect. And are discovering so many other great Artist, fans and collectors. \n\nIt still can be hard, to get noticed; and even sell some of your work.\nBut then sometimes other Artist and collectors step up, getting moved by the talent and try to high lite these Artist, that also need some love and attention.\n\n\n\n\nFede Canovari\n\nHi, my name 's Fede Canovari, born in 93, raised in Florencio Varela, Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nI started with photography as a hobby, taking photo with my phone, learning on the internet until with a lot of effort I was able to buy my first camera. \n\nWhat I like the most is to take pictures of the things that happen in my neighborhood, I try to reflect the usual, what happens to my neighbors, to my friends and even to me.\n\nIt is interesting all the references you find in these images, many things that remind you of the city: a neighbor on the sidewalk, a corner or a group of children riding a bike, what I seek is not to forget what Varela is and where you come from.\n\nEach photograph tells a story, which in turn, reflects a reality that is often overlooked.\n\nAlthough at first my neighbors did not understand why I took pictures in the streets, I think I was the first one to do it, now they all feel identified with my photos and like to find themselves in them.\n\n\n\nElout de Kok\n\nFor the love of Art, and jumping in rain puddles  0__.\n\nI was like 12-13, in the early 80ths and living in the Netherlands, when I first saw the work of graffiti writers on the subways in New York, published in an obscure underground comic magazine. It felt like an alien language, that I still could understand and feel.\nAnd I really loved the sprite-work from videogames; like published by Capcom. Like almost every fast-food place or pub in my town had like a pinball machine and Arcade cabinet, back in the days.\n\nI just thought back then; wow. If I could do that one day...\nThen I started to create and work on my own Art, nobody could or would program for me, so I learned to code myself. Do it yourself.\n\nYears later, a great artist-painter I like; told me, when he was 7 years old. He was watching the murals I created back in the 80'ths. That inspired him to pickup Art as well.\n\nI kinda stopped with graffiti in the late 80's. Somehow it all became too crazy-hectic; I felt like a war-veteran with pstd at the age of 19. Gladly, I could move my energy to Art and Coding.\nAnd it's weird, and like with the Internet; I connected and became friends with some of those early oldskool 1970-80's graffiti kings from New York, that I admired as a kid on the other side of the world.\n\nI started to VJ with my computer generated visuals from 1993, it was a way to make some money with generative coding and computer graphics. From crazy underground parties, to flying around the world and vj'n and meeting some heroes of mine like Fatboy Slim, LTJ Bukem, Kraftwerk.\n\n\nI just hope I can inspire young and old people with my Art and creative coding,\nand I just hope they get creative as well. Go! Level-up!  ^__^\n\nJuly 30, 2022",

A storm of emotions. A storm of everything. And it's all so fast.\n\nAs are the particles. They're all moving around these cyclones of information. Glowing up like neon signs in a busy city.

            "description": "Experimental generative collection that merges analog photography, AI, generative text, and algorithmic coding, by digging down into the essence and building blocks of the different artistic communication channels. \n\nThis work engages with all aforementioned mediums in a joint manner, guided by a random process. It starts with a collection of analog photographs, shot on film and scanned that were later used as a training dataset in Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training. This way, A.I. learns the main characteristics of film photography. In particular, it mimics its recognizable grain. Another type of pixel grain is added with the use of code and pixel shifting as well as digital manipulation. Finally, the last type of “grain” appears with the use of generative text where a different kind of A.I. was given a short description of the project and instructed to imagine the rest of the story. The fragmented and void of meaning parts of generative text are added to the images as one of the possible traits.",
