It links a thousand pairs of points, harmoniously shifting across the canvas, with delicate lines. At each intersection of these lines, color is applied. To produce the final piece, multiple layers of varying colors and intensities are superimposed.\n\n------\n\nControls:\n\n- [x] Save a PNG\n\n- [1] Set height to 768\n- [2] Set height to 1152 \n- [3] Set height to 1536 (default)\n- [4] Set height to 2304\n- [5] Set height to 3072* \n- [6] Set height to 6144*\n- [7] Set height to 9216*\n- [8] Set height to 11520*\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render height\n\n\n* images with height over 3000 pixels render without animating, downloads a PNG automatically after rendering\n\nPlease note that high resolution outputs will take several minutes or even longer to render.

            "description": "Power Ranges is an artistic endeavor born not from a concept, but from the pure spirit of experimentation. While I could attempt to uncover a profound narrative or significance behind this project, the truth of the matter is that Power Ranges is, in essence, just a form of digital doodling with code. A testament to the beauty of unbridled exploration in the realm of art, where discovery and wonder sometimes take precedence over any predetermined purpose.\n\nIn this project, I have harnessed the power of height maps and ranges to create an intriguing visual experience. The origin was the implementation of the marching squares algorithm that I had never used before. From there I started to play with height maps, mixing noise and custom shapes. Finally, I wrote a parser for the map in order to generate the isolines that are then drawn using my beloved Superline script.\n\nI hope you’ll like the outputs as much as I did while testing the algorithm. Some of them can be truly cute.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ”s” to save the current output.\n\nPressing the keys “1”, “2” or “3” the artwork will regenerate at a different scale.\n\nThe “size” parameter can also be passed via URL with the values “s”, “m” or “l” to initialize the generator with the desired size.\n\n=======================================\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\nPowered by p5 and chroma.\n",

We as humans have a need to leave traces - stories - that others can read and learn from. What will be the traces machines want to leave? This piece employs sinusoidal signals drawn with lines as a simple metaphor for every trace and every language, for every message and every communication.\n\necologías-A is an entity that is part of a broader ecology. Released on occasion of the show \"Unbound - Ecology in the Age of Machines\" at Unit London. The data generated by this entity is read by a different piece minted on Ethereum, creating a link between Tezos and Ethereum, a metaphor for an ecology of blockchains.\n\nit shares a common element with two other works released on fxhash: ecologías B and ecologías C, all of them contributing data to aforementioned pieces.\n\nread more at https://www.iillucid.com/ecologias\n\n15% of primary sales are donated to institutions working towards improving biodiversity and environmental efforts.\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nBuilt on p5.js, glsl\n\nappend &pd=N (N a number) to the URL in live view to increase/decrease resolution\npress s to save current image in current resolution\npress z,x,g,b,n followed by +/- to increase/decrease, respectively, brightness, contrast, gamma, blur, noise",

This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory.

            "description": "Colour streaks refer to vibrant and bold streaks of different colors, which involve creating vibrant and dynamic combinations using streaks or lines of different colors. Characterized by their bold and energetic appearance, colors are often combined and layered to create a sense of movement and depth.\nDifferent techniques are usually used to apply colors on canvas or paper. This can include brush strokes, palette knives, or even pouring paint directly onto the surface. Colors are usually applied in long, flowing strokes, creating a sense of flow and rhythm.\nColors have a great influence on the mood and overall effect of the artwork. I chose complementary colors to create contrast and visual interest, and similar colors for a more harmonious and relaxing effect.\nOne of the key aspects of colour streaks is their ability to evoke emotion and stimulate the viewer's imagination. Vibrant colors and dynamic combinations often evoke feelings of joy, energy, or excitement. Flowing lines and color combinations can also create a sense of movement or evoke natural elements such as water or wind.\nOverall, colour streaks are a visually appealing form of abstract expression that celebrates the beauty and power of color. They invite viewers to immerse themselves in their vibrant world and interpret their meaning based on their own perceptions and feelings.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "There is a place in a remote village with only forest and huge meadows and hills around it. I used to spend a few days there in the summer. This year it has become my retreat for the whole summer. There is silence around and no persistent explosions from the bombing. I wanted to use this time to relax and reflect.\n\nWhen I began working on the project, I had no specific goals in my mind. I didn't set myself any tasks, didn't commit to any deadlines. Suddenly, I found something that reminded me of blooming meadows, it was in tune with my state at that moment. So I started to develop this theme. I did not aim to turn it into a realistic picture. The images were supposed to remain abstract, just to convey the general mood and impressions I was feeling.\n \nInitially, it was a story about summer meadows and grasses. But in the process, I had memories of impressions that arose in different seasons, which I observed in nature here. Colour became the main conductor of the story about various states of nature. It is common to see a lot of black soil in spring through which fresh shoots break through, creating bright splashes on a dark background. During the early summer, the area is covered in lush grasses and wildflowers, as well as butterflies. The world blooms and life is reborn. Eventually, the grasses wither due to the hot sun. Sun-burnt straw sheaves take on a special beauty and texture.  As autumn approaches, we turn to the terracotta range, which offers a variety of ripe mature flowers. Winter is all about graphics. During this period, I usually like to take black and white pictures. Every time, every state of nature has its own beauty. As well as every period of our life.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nPlease pay attention: for rendering the project you might need a rather powerful CPU. Depending on your equipment, it may take several seconds to several minutes for the process to complete. \n\nThe project was tested on different browsers; it works best in Chrome. Please make sure the project works on your device.\n\nPlease be aware, if you are minting with Safari or Firefox for Mac, a live preview image may differ slightly from a captured image.\n\nThe final resolution of the saved output depends on the size of your browser window. \n\nTo save a high resolution image add &scale=(and then a number from 4 to 12) to the end of the URL when in live mode. For example, &scale=6. \n\nPress ’s’ to save the image.\n\nTo save an output with a density higher than 9 (or resolution more than 4319x7680) use Firefox for PC or Safari for Mac. Please be aware that it might take more time to generate a higher density output even on a powerful computer, so please be patient.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nOlga Fradina (Live Minting Experience at Unit London), 2023\nMade with p5.js and GLSL.\n\n\n",

Who would care to seek out lifeless lands lost in the cosmos?\n\nAny civilization capable of such reconnaissance might seem above the little hope that barren lands may bring. Unless, of course, there is a hope of answering the most desperate of needs: Finding a New Home.\n\nWere these images captured by humans on Earth, or on Mars, or somewhere even further away in distance and probability? Maybe they’re recon from another planet’s civilization — one that shares our struggle to find true harmony with the world they have.\n\nInspired by the remarkable satellite imagery in the compendium “This is Mars,” Reconnaissance suggests what may lie outside our habitable lands — and that we risk missing what's already here while being compelled to look further and further for what’s next.\n\n\nChoose a resolution (1-6) by adding \"&scale=4\" to the URL in live view.\nCreated with p5.js\n\nTENDER x Nat Sarkissian\nMay 2022",

            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac. In case the site crashes, close all other applications and retry. If you’re not able to render in 12K on your device, please get in touch (@pxlshrd on Social Media and Discord).\n\nPlease note:\n- The Adaptive mode has a slightly altered appearance compared to the default aspect ratio.\n\n- The code was tested on Mac Apple Silicon/Windows/iOS/iPadOS with consistent and pixel-perfect results throughout.\n\n- The live view on Android devices slightly deviates from those on the systems mentioned above.\n\n/////\n\nCreated with p5.js and GLSL shaders.",
