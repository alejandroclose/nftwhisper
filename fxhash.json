            "description": "Welcome to the fx_dungeon(gold). \n\nTo obtain a copy of this cartridge, one must burn 10 editions of the original fx_dungeon. The benefits? This is only an edition of 10, and it's only available until May 13th 2022, 4pm Europe Central Time. After that date, unclaimed copies will be burned. This is a very rare, very limited reskin of the original game.\n\nSince this is a special cartridge, it shows no signs of damage or usage and it comes in perfect mint conditions. It also offers more storage, and levels can be as big as 40x40 tiles compared to the 30x30 of the original game. That's almost double the tiles, if you do the math!\n\nAdditionally, the cartridge has been loaded with additional levels for a minimum of 4 (compared to the original 2) and a maximum of 9 (the original has a 7 levels cap).\n\nIf that wasn't enough, the whole texture pack has been overhauled: each sprite has been either re-done from scratch or improved from the first iteration of the game.\n\n## Controls\n- Move the player around using WASD or the arrow keys. Interact with stairs using SPACEBAR or E\n- Differently from the original game, you can toggle sound on or off using the P key\n\n## Credits\n- I'm using p5js and I also tweaked to my needs a tutorial from Daniel Schiffman about raycasting\n- The ambient music is from Joshua McLean, it's called Mountain Trials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_OYo2RS8iU&list=PLwJjxqYuirCLkq42mGw4XKGQlpZSfxsYd&index=8) and it's released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license",

Your goal is to collect all the coins that are disseminated around the level. Each cartridge comes with the total amount of coins that can be collected displayed on the front. \n\nToken levels are generated from the transaction hash and are never the same between different tokens. Scattered around the levels are also some random amount of decorative props. There are different types of props, and I added those to the features as well.\n\nFinally, each cartridge comes in different conditions. You could get one in perfect conditions, or one that's been used over and over. Don't worry, each cartridge has been tested and it's working properly anyways!!\n\nThis is just a simple game I made learning how to code for creative projects. It's also rumored that's a Golden Edition of this cartridge can be obtained somehow..\n\n## Controls\n- Move the player around using WASD or the arrow keys.

            "description": "\"Mythologic\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nMythologic is a project derived from cloud series, Cloud Atlas and Requiem: Cloud on fxhash. In the series, lines and circles are used in an organics movement like Cloud Hands, which is a move of Tai Chi. Practitioners move their hands slowly and smoothly, make circles and rotate with extreme concentrating. In Chinese we said ‚Äúfloating clouds and flowing water‚Äù to describe calligraphers‚Äô freely flowing style of writing. Chi is a very important for oriental artists, and for genart as well. In the series, lines and circles start from one position to another, and develop with organic rotations and movements, like practicing Tai Chi on the canvas. \n\nMythologic was inspired from ‚ÄúClassic of Mountains and Seas‚Äù, also known as Shan Hai Jing, is a Chinese classic text and a compilation of mythic geography and beasts. \n\n‚ÄúThere is a beast that looks like a fox with nine tails.‚Äù \n‚ÄúHuangbei: it is a beetle with meat like a tadpole, but with a head and a tail‚Äù \n‚ÄúThe beast has the body of a fish but the wings of a bird‚Äù \n\nThere are many incredible creatures in the text which describe the oriental fantasy. The idea of Mythologic is to present an illustrated handbook with random generated paintings, each one is like a framed badge, to memorize the glorious age. It uses the \"cloud hands\" technique in every parts of this piece, the center, the circle and the frame. They are all the same algorithm but perform variety with different density and components. Gold, Silver, Copper, Jade and Ruby colors as noble symbol of treasure in Chinese culture. \n\nThis project use p5js. \n\nPress 'S' to save pictures.\n\nThanks to the support of Yi-Wen Lin in this project.",

Shamanic, mantra-like, willful, affirmations seek to map a desired direction. That is, until time and mind get in the way.¬† Within brief, passing moments, our minds are able to manifest conflicting wishes‚Äîand do so via declarative, convincing statements. \n¬†\nThis work plays inside the chasm that divides intention and action. If we don‚Äôt know what we want, how can we act? Without the commitment of mind along the vast¬†axis of time, our affirmations risk becoming sloganistic, simplistic, unrealistic‚Äîwavering proclamations that announce our vulnerability. \n¬†\nKey words in these algorithmic affirmations shift over time to reflect the way our minds fluctuate. By shuffling words, this collection also explores our fluid relation to language. How to construct meaningful lives, when signification changes, moment to moment, within our minds? \n¬†\nI WISH FOR THE METAVERSE TO RINSE OFF OF ME is a performance of fragility, which is where our humanity‚Äîand our beauty‚Äîabounds. \n\n-spacebar will pause the animation\n\n-return will resume the animation",

            "description": "When exploring new possibilities for a new work, I stumbled across an article on Pulsar map. Created by astronomer Frank Drake and Carl Sagan, this map serves as a galactic address of our solar system for any extra-terrestrial civilization to find using pulsars as signposts. Though chances of any kind of life form intercepting the map are slim, I'm still fascinated both by the possibility of another planetary civilization finding the map (and by extension our Earth), and the thought of using pulsar -- the remaining corpse of ancient massive star -- as universal signposts and landmarks to map the Earth position for any kind of possible civilization. To me there's something so poetic about this; it made me thinks of how small are we, the Humans, compared to those rotating pulsars that we use as mere landmarks to our location...let alone the whole universe. We are just floating stardust after all.\n\nIn this piece I use Lissajous curve array with randomized variable to position the stars and generate spline as 'star trails'. The Lissajous array is interpolated with Perlin noise array to make it less smooth and looks more random.\n\n\n\n----------\nControl:\nPress [s] to capture a screenshot of the current viewport.\nPress [t] to toggle the star trails (default: enabled).\n\n\n\nMade with Cables.gl\n\nXALTED 2022\n",

            "description": "Welcome to the fx_dungeon. Every cartridge comes loaded with a random amount of levels between 2 (common) and 7 (rare). Your goal is to collect all the coins that are disseminated around the level. Each cartridge comes with the total amount of coins that can be collected displayed on the front. \n\nToken levels are generated from the transaction hash and are never the same between different tokens. Scattered around the levels are also some random amount of decorative props. There are different types of props, and I added those to the features as well.\n\nFinally, each cartridge comes in different conditions. You could get one in perfect conditions, or one that's been used over and over. Don't worry, each cartridge has been tested and it's working properly anyways!!\n\nThis is just a simple game I made learning how to code for creative projects. It's also rumored that's a Golden Edition of this cartridge can be obtained somehow..\n\n## Controls\n- Move the player around using WASD or the arrow keys. Interact with stairs using SPACEBAR or E\n- You can click the image to toggle sound on or off\n\n## Credits\n- I'm using p5js and I also tweaked to my needs a tutorial from Daniel Schiffman about raycasting\n- The ambient music is from Joshua McLean, it's called Mountain Trials (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_OYo2RS8iU&list=PLwJjxqYuirCLkq42mGw4XKGQlpZSfxsYd&index=8) and it's released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license",
