It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

            "description": "When i first read an article about how retired New York subway cars were dropped into the Atlantic ocean to serve as man-made reefs, my first thought was: \"does the ocean truly turn them into reefs? Do they want the cars?\". And sure the ocean did. The next photos showed the subway cars rail handles and seats were all covered by barnacles and swarmed by fish. The same thing happened to the hazardous city of Pripyat. 35 years later after the reactor meltdown that resulted in city-wide evacuation, leaving buildings abandoned for years. With no presence of human lives, this gave way for the nature around it to change, some modified genetically, but a lot more now - flourish.\n\nAt the same time, humans have known how to reclaim land from the sea, terraforming hills and valleys to build structures to move people far away, open forests to grow food that will feed the growing mass, and flatten any available lands to build houses that will shelter billions. We seem to flourish even more too.\n\nWhen I created Reclaiming, I thought of nature as an entity that is neither good nor bad. Although human civilization has been advancing more than ever, it feels as if nature is indifferent to the advancement or plight of mankind, and that somehow feels reassuring. The moment we are ready to stop stacking concrete, we will see stem peeking through some cracks. The relationship of nature and humans has been an act of reclaiming parts of each other to survive. Is this humans claiming their nature, or does it belong to nature to begin with?\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Nov22",

This time using MEK.txt’s landscape pixelart series and its distinctive dithering textures, brilliantly translated into code by IceRain to pixel-perfect iterations.\n\nDithered Nostalgia is a step up from MEK.txt & IceRain’s first project (Bento Boxes), trying to make more sophisticated, more detailed and challenging things based on something they passionate about; landscape.\n\nControls:\n[1] Set the resolution to Medium Resolution\n[2] Set the resolution to High Resolution",

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",
