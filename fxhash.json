            "description": "In this piece I tried to explore the combinations of neutral colors in this abstract generative piece. Nothing better than mixing AI + Generative art.\n\nI felt inspired to create this piece after reading this quote from Arshile Gorky,\n\n“Abstraction allows man to see with his mind what he cannot see physically with his eyes....Abstract art enables the artist to perceive beyond the tangible, to extract the infinite out of the finite. It is the emancipation of the mind. It is an exploration into unknown areas.”\n\nI hope you like it! :D",

In this series, urban ensembles are generated with a simple click. With each iteration appears a new densely built city block. Graced with impeccable geometrical lines, devoid of any human presence, these buildings remind us of brutalist utopias like Le Corbusier’s Cité radieuse or Niemeyer’s Brasilia. But despite their clearly modernist feel, there is something hauntingly primitive about them. They could be either New Mexican adobe pueblos, Minoan palaces, or Turkish troglodyte dwellings. Both carved and sculpted, these Ghormenghasts of concrete float in a realm out of time, like in some architect’s dream.\n\nThe purpose of this creative work is to generate 3D architectural projects that could be implemented in the real world. The accelerating lives that we live, complicated by growing and unpredictable environmental crises, call for an enhanced capacity to come up quickly with new architectural solutions adapted to different contexts. From computer assisted design to 3D printing, from augmented reality to real-life housing, from sculpture to architecture, this work aims at bridging the gap between the virtual and the tangible.\n\nWorking as a visual artist, David Umemoto draws inspiration from his training as an architect. He has been using low-tech methods for a long time, refining his talent for elegant simple shapes and combinatory constructions. Now, poured concrete and home-made moulds are giving way to zero-gravity rotating models. The skills he developed while working with real objects find a new playground in the virtual realm.\n",

            "description": "Redols is a piece about the automated arrangement of geometrical shapes in space and how the images generated can foster different moods. It visually investigates how to adjust the amount of randomness and repetition -both in the code loops and in the visual composition- to create structures that contain the mere essence of geometry and of movement.\n\nIt explores the repetitive use of a simple geometric shape: the circle. Adds some counterpoints to enhance it: squares, lines, and triangles which are found in the background. It focuses on circular shapes, not always drawing exactly. They change their core, their measure, the color, the gradient, or some subtle details. The arrangement uses an elliptical distribution and replicates some shapes to promote the visual recognition of bigger parts thus enhancing the movement feeling.\n\nRedols is my genesis piece at fxhash curated by VerticalCrypto Art and Anika Meier.\nExhibited at IN TOUCH: art in the age of post-nftism show at Dekabinett, Berlin, september 2022.\n\nRedols means circular shapes, not perfect ones, in Catalan and is an investigation of how deterministic processes and algorithms can create appealing arrangements that foster non machinic agencies and sentiments.\n\nThe piece is created by code, coding it from scratch, mixing, and mastering basic drawing techniques. This approach pays attention to the art piece getting old -I hope well- and makes it easier to show and view it on different computers and platforms to prevent its obsolescence.\n\nI tested on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Mac OS, Ubuntu, Android, and iPhone in vertical and horizontal mode, but please check it works on your device before minting.\n\n----\npossible features:\n- colors:  super fosc marro, super blau, taronja-marro, taronja-blau, marro-taronja, marro-blau, blau-taronja, blau-marro.\n- fons: quadradets, escaires, diagonals.\n- fonsple: true, false.\n- redols: equilibrat, mironia, migmig, degradats, vespa, mandarina, us, os, pla.\n- fons2diagonals: true, false.\n\nAnna Carreras 2022",

            "description": "I try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "I try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "I try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "The universe is terrifyingly vast, mostly pitch-dark, save some billions of trillions of stars and planets. We are nothing. In all that vastness, we are the smallest fraction of time imaginable, floating around on a speck of dust. Yet somehow, we continue to work, learn, build relationships, create, and participate in all these other odd, uniquely human practices. It’s truly fascinating, when in the grand scheme, none of it seems consequential.\n\nAmara Celestial is an artistic representation of this intergalactic madness and the love for it. To expand on the project’s identity…Amara, my wife’s name, has many meanings. In her culture and family, it means “love” or “everlasting beauty”. Celestial most commonly refers to things not of this world, but from the sky, or space. The shapes, lines, and primary design of this project represent the unpredictable nature of the universe. The entire piece is stippled with thousands of points of various palette selected colors, to resemble the uncountable number of light sources in the great sea of space, as well as to provide textural depth.\n\nThe Features:\n- Canvas Style: Pretty simple, the canvas can be square (2048 x 2048), portrait (1352 X 2048) or landscape (2048 x 1352).\n- Palettes: There are 10 different palettes, each with equal chance of being randomly chosen. The palettes were heavily influenced by my wife. She is a woman of South American descent and loves the bright colors and contrast often seen in the traditional clothing and art of her culture. There are a few muted palettes, including a mono palette to mix things up!\n- Background Color: The background color can be black, white, or blue with varying rarity.\n- Background Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the background shape (if drawn).\n- Primary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the primary shape (i.e., the foremost shape).\n- Secondary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the secondary shape.\n- Posterize: This is a color limiting filter that can cause harsher (less smooth) changes in color. The lower the number, the more abrupt the changes (2 being the lowest allowed).\n- Primary Shape Centered: This is a true/false based on whether the primary shape is centered on the canvas.\n- Background override: This will override the selected background and replace it with vertical or horizontal lines, or prevent the background shape from being drawn entirely.\n\nOther randomness factors (non-features)\n- Stroke thickness on various shapes and points of the project.\n- Size of the overall shapes, as well as the size of the inner radius of the shapes.\n- Spacing between the stippling and lines (to keep it pattern-less).\n- Positioning of all the shapes (restricted to the canvas).\n- The number of iterations (rings) for each shape.",

            "description": "The universe is terrifyingly vast, mostly pitch-dark, save some billions of trillions of stars and planets. We are nothing. In all that vastness, we are the smallest fraction of time imaginable, floating around on a speck of dust. Yet somehow, we continue to work, learn, build relationships, create, and participate in all these other odd, uniquely human practices. It’s truly fascinating, when in the grand scheme, none of it seems consequential.\n\nAmara Celestial is an artistic representation of this intergalactic madness and the love for it. To expand on the project’s identity…Amara, my wife’s name, has many meanings. In her culture and family, it means “love” or “everlasting beauty”. Celestial most commonly refers to things not of this world, but from the sky, or space. The shapes, lines, and primary design of this project represent the unpredictable nature of the universe. The entire piece is stippled with thousands of points of various palette selected colors, to resemble the uncountable number of light sources in the great sea of space, as well as to provide textural depth.\n\nThe Features:\n- Canvas Style: Pretty simple, the canvas can be square (2048 x 2048), portrait (1352 X 2048) or landscape (2048 x 1352).\n- Palettes: There are 10 different palettes, each with equal chance of being randomly chosen. The palettes were heavily influenced by my wife. She is a woman of South American descent and loves the bright colors and contrast often seen in the traditional clothing and art of her culture. There are a few muted palettes, including a mono palette to mix things up!\n- Background Color: The background color can be black, white, or blue with varying rarity.\n- Background Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the background shape (if drawn).\n- Primary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the primary shape (i.e., the foremost shape).\n- Secondary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the secondary shape.\n- Posterize: This is a color limiting filter that can cause harsher (less smooth) changes in color. The lower the number, the more abrupt the changes (2 being the lowest allowed).\n- Primary Shape Centered: This is a true/false based on whether the primary shape is centered on the canvas.\n- Background override: This will override the selected background and replace it with vertical or horizontal lines, or prevent the background shape from being drawn entirely.\n\nOther randomness factors (non-features)\n- Stroke thickness on various shapes and points of the project.\n- Size of the overall shapes, as well as the size of the inner radius of the shapes.\n- Spacing between the stippling and lines (to keep it pattern-less).\n- Positioning of all the shapes (restricted to the canvas).\n- The number of iterations (rings) for each shape.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
