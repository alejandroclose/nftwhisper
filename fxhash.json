            "description": "\"M.A.P.\", an acronym for \"Mental Altered Panorama\", embodies a generative art project that explores the nuances of imaginary cartography.\nImplementing a loosely constrained algorithm, the work generates a unique composition of vectors, lines, and hatchings. Digital noise acts as a conductor, feeding these abstract elements, resulting in an intentionally modified \"map\" without a predetermined destination or definition.\n\n---\n\nTechnical Mechanisms\n\nThe conceptual architecture of this creation is based on an algorithm that uses digital noise as a virtual pencil. Deliberately free of geographical and social conventions, this algorithm shapes patterns and textures that evoke - but do not mimetically reproduce - topographical maps, urban plans, and even imaginary archipelagos.\n\n---\n\nSpectator Experience\n\nWhat distinguishes M.A.P. is its implicit call for interpretation and contemplation. The randomly generated visual elements serve as a fertile substrate for the viewer's imagination. This versatile canvas becomes the stage for a variety of possible narratives: some may see the labyrinthine layout of a futuristic city, while others may see a network of mountain paths leading to hidden retreats. Still others might imagine winding sea lanes through unexplored archipelagos, or borders delineating distopian territories. In short, although the canvas is neutral, it offers limitless space for mental exploration and creative extrapolation.\n\n---\n\nM.A.P. is an original work by 0xma. 2023.\n\n---\n\nNotes:\nBuilt with p5.js and p5.grain\nIn live view, press [1-5] to render at different resolutions and press 's' to save the output.",

            "description": "\"M.A.P.\", an acronym for \"Mental Altered Panorama\", embodies a generative art project that explores the nuances of imaginary cartography.\nImplementing a loosely constrained algorithm, the work generates a unique composition of vectors, lines, and hatchings. Digital noise acts as a conductor, feeding these abstract elements, resulting in an intentionally modified \"map\" without a predetermined destination or definition.\n\n---\n\nTechnical Mechanisms\n\nThe conceptual architecture of this creation is based on an algorithm that uses digital noise as a virtual pencil. Deliberately free of geographical and social conventions, this algorithm shapes patterns and textures that evoke - but do not mimetically reproduce - topographical maps, urban plans, and even imaginary archipelagos.\n\n---\n\nSpectator Experience\n\nWhat distinguishes M.A.P. is its implicit call for interpretation and contemplation. The randomly generated visual elements serve as a fertile substrate for the viewer's imagination. This versatile canvas becomes the stage for a variety of possible narratives: some may see the labyrinthine layout of a futuristic city, while others may see a network of mountain paths leading to hidden retreats. Still others might imagine winding sea lanes through unexplored archipelagos, or borders delineating distopian territories. In short, although the canvas is neutral, it offers limitless space for mental exploration and creative extrapolation.\n\n---\n\nM.A.P. is an original work by 0xma. 2023.\n\n---\n\nNotes:\nBuilt with p5.js and p5.grain\nIn live view, press [1-5] to render at different resolutions and press 's' to save the output.",

In every edition, you'll encounter a solitary tree, standing tall and proud, alongside a single cloud drifting across the canvas. Yet, despite these constants, the compositions exhibit remarkable diversity in their arrangement.\n\nThe clouds, in particular, embrace myriad forms. They may shroud the tree in a gentle mist, delicately frame a set of bare branches, conjure the semblance of a face, or take on the appearance of wisps of smoke emanating from a tree ablaze. At times, they become the trailing exhaust of a rocket, create the foundational contours of a mountain crowned by a lone tree, or mimic a boulder descending from the heavens.\n\nFurthermore, the palette of colors and the patterns of organic brushstrokes that breathe life into each scene are a source of boundless diversity. With each new iteration, an entirely unique landscape comes to life, unveiling a fresh perspective on the mesmerizing interplay of nature's elements.\n\nI hope you enjoy this collection!\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis is a 100% code generated project.

In every edition, you'll encounter a solitary tree, standing tall and proud, alongside a single cloud drifting across the canvas. Yet, despite these constants, the compositions exhibit remarkable diversity in their arrangement.\n\nThe clouds, in particular, embrace myriad forms. They may shroud the tree in a gentle mist, delicately frame a set of bare branches, conjure the semblance of a face, or take on the appearance of wisps of smoke emanating from a tree ablaze. At times, they become the trailing exhaust of a rocket, create the foundational contours of a mountain crowned by a lone tree, or mimic a boulder descending from the heavens.\n\nFurthermore, the palette of colors and the patterns of organic brushstrokes that breathe life into each scene are a source of boundless diversity. With each new iteration, an entirely unique landscape comes to life, unveiling a fresh perspective on the mesmerizing interplay of nature's elements.\n\nI hope you enjoy this collection!\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis is a 100% code generated project.

            "description": "Tree and Cloud\n\nThis project continues my exploration into the realm of generative impressionistic landscapes. In every edition, you'll encounter a solitary tree, standing tall and proud, alongside a single cloud drifting across the canvas. Yet, despite these constants, the compositions exhibit remarkable diversity in their arrangement.\n\nThe clouds, in particular, embrace myriad forms. They may shroud the tree in a gentle mist, delicately frame a set of bare branches, conjure the semblance of a face, or take on the appearance of wisps of smoke emanating from a tree ablaze. At times, they become the trailing exhaust of a rocket, create the foundational contours of a mountain crowned by a lone tree, or mimic a boulder descending from the heavens.\n\nFurthermore, the palette of colors and the patterns of organic brushstrokes that breathe life into each scene are a source of boundless diversity. With each new iteration, an entirely unique landscape comes to life, unveiling a fresh perspective on the mesmerizing interplay of nature's elements.\n\nI hope you enjoy this collection!\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis is a 100% code generated project.

            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "RAUSCH is a series of generative artworks that explore imaginary digital architectures. \n\nThis series challenges traditional notions of architectural representation and raises important questions about the role of resolution in design. Just as the pixel resolution of an image affects its perceived quality, the resolution of an architectural space can affect its qualities and livability. By embracing digital variation through codes, this series explores the interplay between abstract and concrete space through multiple resolutions. \n\nRAUSCH is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by complex, chaotic and messy sensations, and aims to engage the viewer through a sense of wonder, disorientation, and awe.\n\nReleased on the occasion of Companions of Code, a group exhibition by VerticalCrypto Art at The NFT Gallery in London. \nCurated by Micol Ap. Exhibition 10-24 February 2023 \n\n___________________________________________________\nRAUSCH Controls:\n\nAnimation: \n• ‘1 - 2 - 3 - 4’ animate views\n• 'MouseClick' pause/play animation\n\nFunctions:\n(press key & wait)\n• 'F' 24 FPS\n• 'B' b/w mode \n\nResize Canvas:\n(press key & wait)\n• '6' Portrait A4 - 1000x1414\n• '7' Landscape 16:9 - 1920x1080\n• '8' Portrait 9:16 - 1080x1920\n• '9' Square 1:1 - 1024x1024\n• 'DoubleClick' Fullscreen\n\nSave & Export Image:\n• 'S' save a .png of in current resolution\n\nSave & Export GIF:\n• 'G' save a 1-2 sec. seamless loop .gif of current view \n• 'P' save a 12-24 sec. seamless loop .gif of all the views\n• 'T’ scale down current resolution, save a 12 sec. seamless loop .gif\n\nSteps to save a gif/png :\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• resize canvas with 6,7,8, or 9 to your desired aspect ratio (wait)\n• press S,G or P to save & download (wait) \n• enjoy RAUSCH :)\n\nSave & Export GIF for social media sharing:\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• press T or G wait for recalculation & download. \n• enjoy RAUSCH \n• post on Twitter ;)\n__________________________________________________\n\nThis token may not work on mobile(!), but it allows exporting .png and .gif (see controls) to enjoy RAUSCH on different displays or mobile.
