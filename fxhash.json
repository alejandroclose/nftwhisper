It must be viewed with four pieces per line, and iterations from lowest to highest. You may need to resize the window to display the full project properly.\n\nThis piece is an experimental exploration of what lies beyond the canvas, told through counter-cultural slogans. Its nature is reflected in these chosen mottos, embodying the disdain for the old and the embrace of the new, unique and non-traditional style of this token. It's a call to arms for more avant-garde, experimental projects that push the limits of what we would currently consider generative art. Ignore the tried and true. Go against the grain.

But once every thousand years, it spreads its wings on a large pile of firewood and sings, and when it is excited by its song, it lights a fire with its beak, and by burning in the fire from its ashes, another phoenix is ​​born.\nIn many cultures, the phoenix is ​​considered a symbol of immortality, sacrifice and long life.\n\nIn this work, I tried to create bird-like shapes that are being formed and created by using a grid in the form of noise and with the shape of rectangles that have random length and width and get their color from the palettes. You can clearly see the wings or the bird's head in most of the exits\nIn fact, my idea is to depict the moment of resurrection and rebirth of the phoenix from the heart of the ashes, which rises to the sky.\nthe ash particles around this reborn bird are being scattered in the air and finally from At the heart of this re-creation, a beautiful and glorious phoenix comes into existence.\n\nMade by p5.js",

Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

But once every thousand years, it spreads its wings on a large pile of firewood and sings, and when it is excited by its song, it lights a fire with its beak, and by burning in the fire from its ashes, another phoenix is ​​born.\nIn many cultures, the phoenix is ​​considered a symbol of immortality, sacrifice and long life.\n\nIn this work, I tried to create bird-like shapes that are being formed and created by using a grid in the form of noise and with the shape of rectangles that have random length and width and get their color from the palettes. You can clearly see the wings or the bird's head in most of the exits\nIn fact, my idea is to depict the moment of resurrection and rebirth of the phoenix from the heart of the ashes, which rises to the sky.\nthe ash particles around this reborn bird are being scattered in the air and finally from At the heart of this re-creation, a beautiful and glorious phoenix comes into existence.\n\nMade by p5.js",
