Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file.

The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",

            "description": "The Corium is a roughly spherical mass (diameter ~1km), of currently unknown origins situated within the core region of the solar system's asteroid belt.\nThe body was discovered during a uranium extraction mission undertaken by ET Resources at the behest of Station 733-H (Mars colony) leadership, when ionising radiation levels detected by deployed surface craft exceeded equipment and personnel tolerance levels by many orders of magnitude.\n\nWhile ETR crew were quick to respond to local abort orders (27 minutes from initial readings to fleet reorientation); Station 733-H made the determination that radiation exposure levels were already far in excess of anything that could be reasonably mitigated upon the ETR fleet's return.\nThe ETR fleet was ordered to jettison fuel reserves under Section 9 of the Space Corporations Act (Mars) approximately 90 minutes after the readings were initially reported. It is understood that all deployed personnel accessed their barbiturate rations within the following 24 hours.\n\nThe fleet itself remains in position some ~3000kms from The Corium, with plans to relocate the vessels still underway (albeit a low priority).\n\n\nSTATION 733-H OBSERVATION REPORT SUMMARY (14.1.1)\n\nTo date, remote analysis suggests that the body is compositionally similar to corium deposits observed following terrestrial nuclear disasters, consisting of a range of solidified radioactive compounds as well as a number of currently unidentified metal alloys. More in-depth analysis has been impossible to date due to the rapid physical decay of personnel and equipment as their proximity to samples reach a critical threshold.\n\nAll samples have so far been extruded from the surface of The Corium via laser, and maneuvered into orbit around Mars at the edge of it's sphere of influence (at a distance of no less than 50,000kms from Station 733-H), via projectile barrage and gas envelopment.\n\nThe surface of The Corium itself is littered with an array of clearly engineered forms; radial and rectangular patterns, deep crevasses, mazes and grids with only a select few areas resembling the pools of lava observed where Corium has formed terrestrially (it is unclear whether these deposits have formed since the surface was initially engineered).\n\nThe accompanying files are LIDAR renders of the extracted samples in proximity to Station 733-H and are marked for dissemination to terrestrial research teams on Mars. Study of The Corium remains the sole priority of Station 733-H research personnel, as any risks presented to the solar system or its inhabitants are currently not well understood.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe piece will render from the top right and might take ~5-10 seconds to begin.\n\nAppend \"&print=true\" to the live render URL for a hi-res output.",

The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM.

All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",

            "description": "The Corium is a roughly spherical mass (diameter ~1km), of currently unknown origins situated within the core region of the solar system's asteroid belt.\nThe body was discovered during a uranium extraction mission undertaken by ET Resources at the behest of Station 733-H (Mars colony) leadership, when ionising radiation levels detected by deployed surface craft exceeded equipment and personnel tolerance levels by many orders of magnitude.\n\nWhile ETR crew were quick to respond to local abort orders (27 minutes from initial readings to fleet reorientation); Station 733-H made the determination that radiation exposure levels were already far in excess of anything that could be reasonably mitigated upon the ETR fleet's return.\nThe ETR fleet was ordered to jettison fuel reserves under Section 9 of the Space Corporations Act (Mars) approximately 90 minutes after the readings were initially reported. It is understood that all deployed personnel accessed their barbiturate rations within the following 24 hours.\n\nThe fleet itself remains in position some ~3000kms from The Corium, with plans to relocate the vessels still underway (albeit a low priority).\n\n\nSTATION 733-H OBSERVATION REPORT SUMMARY (14.1.1)\n\nTo date, remote analysis suggests that the body is compositionally similar to corium deposits observed following terrestrial nuclear disasters, consisting of a range of solidified radioactive compounds as well as a number of currently unidentified metal alloys. More in-depth analysis has been impossible to date due to the rapid physical decay of personnel and equipment as their proximity to samples reach a critical threshold.\n\nAll samples have so far been extruded from the surface of The Corium via laser, and maneuvered into orbit around Mars at the edge of it's sphere of influence (at a distance of no less than 50,000kms from Station 733-H), via projectile barrage and gas envelopment.\n\nThe surface of The Corium itself is littered with an array of clearly engineered forms; radial and rectangular patterns, deep crevasses, mazes and grids with only a select few areas resembling the pools of lava observed where Corium has formed terrestrially (it is unclear whether these deposits have formed since the surface was initially engineered).\n\nThe accompanying files are LIDAR renders of the extracted samples in proximity to Station 733-H and are marked for dissemination to terrestrial research teams on Mars. Study of The Corium remains the sole priority of Station 733-H research personnel, as any risks presented to the solar system or its inhabitants are currently not well understood.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe piece will render from the top right and might take ~5-10 seconds to begin.\n\nAppend \"&print=true\" to the live render URL for a hi-res output.",

The first sketch, drawn by hand with Procreate, was made in October 2021.\n\nThis is an exploration on the field of Generative Cartographies, an abstract diagrammatic representation of a randomly generated area within the virtual IPFS world. Everything starts with an GRID of varying sizes and angles, subsequently POPULATED by a random number of forms. But, how to populate the grid? SPARSELY, of course, with just the right amount of superpositions.\n\nThe algorithm produces varying compositions of fourteen different forms, with seven possible mixes and ten colour palettes. Movement, made possible by its generative digital nature, follows sinusoidal patterns, as if the forms breathed and danced to an unheard music.\n\nBesides, they never forget to celebrate birthdays.\n\n\n// INTERACTIVITY\n\n- CLICK or SPACEBAR to stop movement.\n- UP and DOWN ARROWS to Disable/Enable graphic elements such as texts (wink).\n- LEFT and RIGHT ARROWS (when stopped) to Move frames back and forth.\n- Press 1 for a low-res PNG.\n- Press 2 for a medium-res PNG (3x).\n- Press 3 for a hi-res PNG (6x).\n- Press G for Glitch (low-res).\n- Press P for PixelArt (low-res).\n\nIf you want a different resolution, you can also add ?&res=xxx to the url to get your desired output.

            "description": "Take your entire life, full as it is with the vastness of your lived experiences – and shape it into your cupped hands. Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",

            "description": "I had a wonderful childhood. I grew up near a big lake, in a house with a huge garden. You could get lost for the whole day, building houses on trees, collecting flowers and stones or stealing food from the vegetable garden. Having a brother of the same age made things even better, endless adventures with somebody saving you every time you are too dumb to realize you are walking into troubles.\n\nWe enjoyed the summers with the hot days, the fireflies and the nights full of falling stars. The winters with the snow, the stalactites and our box turtle disappearing for months to then reappear in the spring (Until she did not).\n\nAt the same time, taking care of the garden was a big responsibility, affecting our family life in many ways. Numerous times, I felt like the efforts we were putting in to keep it in order were never enough and nature was always faster in restoring her point of view. A struggle that affects us humans since we started to bend nature at our will, thousands of years ago.\n\nIn my gardens, I tried to capture this struggle, this constant fight to shape nature at our will.\nHowever, I also tried to represent the beauty that can be found in both savage and human shaped nature, if shaped with love and respect.\n\nI dedicate this project to my grandfather, who gave us a garden.\nI am sure he would have loved it.\n\n---\n\nHand coded with love and obsession. 💚\n\nPowered by p5, p5.createLoop and chroma.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\nPress ‘m’ to open a menu with the available outputs.\n\nThe generation of a hi-res image, up to 8000x8000, takes a few seconds.\nThe generation of an Animated GIF takes several minutes and the save command works only once the GIF is complete.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters that can be used to load different configurations.\n\n- mode = 0 | 1\n0 For static PNG images, 1 for animated GIFs\n\n- size = s | m | l\nThe Size of the output, 1080x1080, 4000x4000, 8000x8000 for static images and 512x512, 800x800, 1080x1080 for animated GIFs\n\n- fps = 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30\nFrames per second of animated GIFs\n\n=============> PROFILES <==============\n\t\nWeeds ------------------> 42%\nShapes -----------------> 7%\nFlower Power -----------> 5%\nStrips -----------------> 5%\nBadlands ---------------> 5%\nCircle Flower Packing --> 5%\nIna's Farm -------------> 5%\nFortified Pond ---------> 3%\nFalling Into You -------> 3%\nCultivar ---------------> 2%\nThe Hedge --------------> 2%\nRocky Mountains --------> 2%\nUnreachable Rivers -----> 2%\nMushrooms Heaven -------> 2%\nDante ------------------> 1.75%\nAcid Lands -------------> 1.75%\nProvence ---------------> 1.5%\nThe Springs ------------> 1.25%\nSecret Garden ----------> 1%\nThe Pump ---------------> 1%\nTetris -----------------> 1%\nThe Spiral -------------> 0.5%\nKinetic Sculpture ------> 0.25%\n\nInsects are visible only in the animated outputs.\n\n=============> MAKING OF <=============\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/article/the-making-of-noisy-gardens\n\n---",

The iterations will be titled ____ 0.1, ____ 0.2, etc. At this point, the number of iterations has not been determined, but more information will be provided as this experiment unfolds.\n\nThe final release will only be made available to those who have collected each iteration (using an allowlist), and will be released for free.",
