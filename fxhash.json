It may take several seconds to produce a recognizable image, and several minutes to produce a high-quality render with no visible noise.\n\nCreated with webgl and clojurescript.\n\nControls:\n\nClick on the canvas to open a menu in the top right corner. In this menu you will see controls to capture a screenshot, adjust resolution, and adjust the camera, along with several other controls.\n\nWhen the \"optimized render\" option is checked, the page will compute an acceleration structure before rendering to allow the piece to converge much faster. With this option checked, the piece may need to process for up to a minute before rendering begins, but subsequently the rendering will proceed much more quickly than normal. This can be used to generate high-quality captures more quickly than when the option is not checked.\n\nWhen the \"filtering\" option is checked, a noise filter will be applied to the result of the render, reducing the appearance of noise.\n\nThe \"logic multiple\" slider can be used to multiply the amount of rendering work done each frame. Increasing this number may allow the piece to render more quickly, but may also make the page laggy. It is not recommended to increase this number unless you have a powerful GPU.",

            "description": "Uninhabitable is a generative system built only from ellipses. The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state. Press \"h\" to save it.\n\nUninhabitable is an original work by Iskra Velitchkova. 2021.",

            "description": "The Corium is a roughly spherical mass (diameter ~1km), of currently unknown origins situated within the core region of the solar system's asteroid belt.\nThe body was discovered during a uranium extraction mission undertaken by ET Resources at the behest of Station 733-H (Mars colony) leadership, when ionising radiation levels detected by deployed surface craft exceeded equipment and personnel tolerance levels by many orders of magnitude.\n\nWhile ETR crew were quick to respond to local abort orders (27 minutes from initial readings to fleet reorientation); Station 733-H made the determination that radiation exposure levels were already far in excess of anything that could be reasonably mitigated upon the ETR fleet's return.\nThe ETR fleet was ordered to jettison fuel reserves under Section 9 of the Space Corporations Act (Mars) approximately 90 minutes after the readings were initially reported. It is understood that all deployed personnel accessed their barbiturate rations within the following 24 hours.\n\nThe fleet itself remains in position some ~3000kms from The Corium, with plans to relocate the vessels still underway (albeit a low priority).\n\n\nSTATION 733-H OBSERVATION REPORT SUMMARY (14.1.1)\n\nTo date, remote analysis suggests that the body is compositionally similar to corium deposits observed following terrestrial nuclear disasters, consisting of a range of solidified radioactive compounds as well as a number of currently unidentified metal alloys. More in-depth analysis has been impossible to date due to the rapid physical decay of personnel and equipment as their proximity to samples reach a critical threshold.\n\nAll samples have so far been extruded from the surface of The Corium via laser, and maneuvered into orbit around Mars at the edge of it's sphere of influence (at a distance of no less than 50,000kms from Station 733-H), via projectile barrage and gas envelopment.\n\nThe surface of The Corium itself is littered with an array of clearly engineered forms; radial and rectangular patterns, deep crevasses, mazes and grids with only a select few areas resembling the pools of lava observed where Corium has formed terrestrially (it is unclear whether these deposits have formed since the surface was initially engineered).\n\nThe accompanying files are LIDAR renders of the extracted samples in proximity to Station 733-H and are marked for dissemination to terrestrial research teams on Mars. Study of The Corium remains the sole priority of Station 733-H research personnel, as any risks presented to the solar system or its inhabitants are currently not well understood.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe piece will render from the top right and might take ~5-10 seconds to begin.\n\nAppend \"&print=true\" to the live render URL for a hi-res output.",
