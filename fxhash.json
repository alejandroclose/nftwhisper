We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it. Thank you very much for collecting and for your continuous support.\n\n10% of primary and secondary sales will go to fxhash team; thank you for what you are doing.\n\nSelf reserved pieces are for promised gifts to my collectors.\n\nPress S to save as PNG.

            "description": "\"Junina\" is a tribute to the June popular festivities in Brazil, when the streets and house facades are decorated on many cities, mainly on the Northeast Region of the country. Small flags, paper balloons, and lamps are hung on public space creating a very special atmosphere and colorful landscapes. \n\nPlenty of forró (traditional music), bonfires, fireworks, typical food and drinks are part of these festivities that celebrate rural popular culture. The “Festas Juninas” (June festivities) have an important affective place in the imaginary of the Brazilian population. \n\n\"Junina\" continues the experimentations with code of my previous work \"Monotipia\". The challenge of creating graphic compositions with simple elements remains. Searching and trying to delve deeper into ways to play with the rhythm and subtleties of transparencies, colors, shapes and textures.\n\nThis project is also an homage to the painters who made the Brazilian June festivities as the theme of their works, especially Alfredo Volpi (1896-1988) and Alberto da Veiga Guignard (1896-1962), but also Anita Malfatti (1889-1964), Emiliano Di Cavalcanti (1897-1976), Heitor dos Prazeres (1898-1966), and many others.\n\n---\nFeatures:\n-> 8 palettes (rarest = grayscale)\n-> 9 compositions\n-> Elements: 6 geometric shapes OR mixed element compositions\n-> 5 canvas formats: \n-----> tall portrait (9:16)\n-----> portrait (2:3)\n-----> square (1:1)\n-----> landscape (3:2)\n-----> wide landscape (16:9) = rarest\n-> Border colors: \n-----> soft\n-----> dark\n-----> deep gray\n-----> soberest color from palette\n-----> random color from palette (rarest)\n\n* The names of the color palettes are words related to popular June festivals. The decision to use untranslated expressions was made because these words carry many poetic meanings in Portuguese. For example, \"cinza\" means \"gray\" but also \"ash\". A word that refers to both the color and to the residue that results from burning wood in bonfires.\n\n---\nTo save the image as a png file, type:\n[1] save at actual size \n[2] save with 2000px height\n[3] save with 3000px height\n[4] save with 4000px height\n[5] save with 5000px height\n\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n---\nCreated with p5.js\n\n---\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2023\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada",
