            "description": "NEBELWALD is the first series of about 10 different tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years. \n\nThis project explores a minimalist approach to tree naturalism using a recursive algorithm and includes three traits: a density layer of fog, a measure of tree growth, and the softness of snowfall.\n\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png.\n\nArtist notes:\n\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nOnce I experienced it in a dense fog, which was amazing! beautiful and mysterious at the same time. This has definitely inspired the NEBELWALD work series.\n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: http://lumicon.de/e-art/project/nebelwald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND\n",

Note, this effects performance.\n * Reset the Kinetic by by tapping backspace.\n\nKinetics is a neo-constructivist generative art project built using p5js. Each Kinetic delicately moves from it's origin, giving the appearance of infinite space and possibility. The viewer witnesses the construction of the Kinetic floating inside of the negative. Shapes and lines move around the Kinetic in a dazzling display of contrasting color.\n\nThe texture developed for Kinetics, deemed The Creation of the Universe (See top right) is at its core a color gradient of 3 different colors. Each piece construct's itself, drawing lines on top of lines to create a unique self contained assembly of materials as opposed to a realistic abstraction. The Creation of the Universe repeats itself in each piece, just as cells do in an organic structure. From here is where it initially got it's name.\n\nInspired heavily by the works of Rodchenko and Tatlin, each Kinetic appears to slot together like a puzzle. Each piece has multiple hard edge planes clashing aggressively with each other giving the sense that there is more than just a flat canvas. A quasi realism is created through our desire to build instead of simply paint.\n\n\"Long Live Generative Art\"\n\n- Mitchell",

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

Double tapping will have the same effect audio-wise.\n\nThis is part of the celebration of fxhash turning 1. That’s why there are 365 editions, and 50% of all primary sales will be donated evenly between “Processing Foundation” and “Three.js”. 20% of all royalties are given back to the minter.\n\nHere are some stats for you:\n\nAbout 1/10 will render the lines in wireframes.\nThere are 2 different synth pitches distributed evenly.\n10% will have one single line color, instead of 3 primary ones.\nIn rough measures, every 4th will have an irregular wiggle motion flow instead of a circular one.\n\nIn addition to all of the above, there can be different values in regards to line counts, line lengths, line widths, speeds, width grows, radius increments, angle increments, z-index increments, background colors, border colors, and so on.\n\n#fxhashturnsone\n\n@computeremotions - 2022-11-13",
