            "description": "We are filling our one and only world with our endless cities, roads and structures, for as far as the eye can see. We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it. Thank you very much for collecting and for your continuous support.\n\n10% of primary and secondary sales will go to fxhash team; thank you for what you are doing.\n\nSelf reserved pieces are for promised gifts to my collectors.\n\nPress S to save as PNG.

Each city comes with its own randomized city day.\n\nEach mint has a native setting (Day or Night) which combined with the current time of viewing influences real-time movements of celestial bodies in your mint, e.g. on a mint with the Day setting, the sun will only appear when viewed during the day. The piece will re-render every minute.\n\nThe individual strokes of this token feature some of my latest developments of an algorithm that generatively simulates the texture of print imperfections. They are randomized at each render to give it a unique character. Note that depending on the complexity of each mint, some renders may introduce a brief pause. The aesthetics are greatly inspired by plotter art of early computer artists such as 'City Painting' by Grace C. Hertlein.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Nov 2021\nArtist: @Yazid",

            "description": "This project is borne out of my longstanding fascination with brushwork, and the intricate textures that can be created with a brush, some paint and a canvas. Brush strokes are simulated using many overlapping lines and given texture and depth using a custom shader. Another important aspect of this work, is the composite forms that are created by the brush strokes, which are my attempt to emulate the emphatic energy of many abstract painters that have come before me. Color palettes are named after common paint colors, based on the background color used for the palette.\n\nThose who collect during the first tier of the Dutch Auction can claim a signed print. They will be printed on A3 Hahnemuhle Photo Rag, and shipped to the collector free of charge. More details on how to claim a print and specify the necessary shipping information will be provided via the artists twitter (@landlinesart1).\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

            "description": "Ataraxis (or a broken volume renderer) is an exploration in balancing discomfort and calm. The piece generates spaces on the fly that are designed to elicit strange and uncomfortable feelings - like a desolate, alien dreamscape - claustrophobic, surreal, not quite real yet strangely recognisable. But the idea is that while these spaces feel uncomfortable, they're also strangely, antilogically calming. The idea is to elicit a sanguine emotion, to make the viewer feel calm in a strange place, and to lead them somewhere else.\n\nThis work is the culmination of many years of work researching volumetric rendering techniques. This token uses a raymarching technique that is intentionally broken in various ways.\n\nControls:\nDouble-click to download\n&w=X&h=y to change the size of the piece\n&dpr=x to change the resolution of the pice - higher resolutions will result in slightly different artworks as the browser attempts to compensate for the overlarge canvas\n&fullscreen=true to change the token to display the full size of your browser. This may impact the rendering of the token, so use with caution",

            "description": "‘CASCADE’ is an animated and interactive art series created with javascript by the collaborative efforts of José Gasparian and MCHX. The series is inspired by the captivating beauty of water, a source of fascination for both artists and it features two distinctive palettes, each created by one of the artists. \n\nThe endless real time animation captures the essence of water, its ever-changing form, and the interplay of light and shadow. It creates a sense of movement and dynamism, immersing the viewer in a world of fluidity and serene beauty.\n\nEach token has an original set of characteristics, randomly determined by the hash from the following options:\n\n• Color palettes (JG or MCHX)\n• Animation speed (Ocean, River or Waterfall) and direction (North or South)\n• Number of cascades (1, 2, 3 or 4)\n• Number of color sets (2, 4, 7 or 13)\n\nDon't forget to click on the canvas to change the color combinations! We hope you enjoy it! 🙂\n\nJG & MCHX. 2023.",

            "description": "‘CASCADE’ is an animated and interactive art series created with javascript by the collaborative efforts of José Gasparian and MCHX. The series is inspired by the captivating beauty of water, a source of fascination for both artists and it features two distinctive palettes, each created by one of the artists. \n\nThe endless real time animation captures the essence of water, its ever-changing form, and the interplay of light and shadow. It creates a sense of movement and dynamism, immersing the viewer in a world of fluidity and serene beauty.\n\nEach token has an original set of characteristics, randomly determined by the hash from the following options:\n\n• Color palettes (JG or MCHX)\n• Animation speed (Ocean, River or Waterfall) and direction (North or South)\n• Number of cascades (1, 2, 3 or 4)\n• Number of color sets (2, 4, 7 or 13)\n\nDon't forget to click on the canvas to change the color combinations! We hope you enjoy it! 🙂\n\nJG & MCHX. 2023.",

            "description": "As the abandoned sewage planet Xnor lay seemingly dormant, aeons crept by. Erosion and oxidation recombined in plumbing, slowly causing the pipes to evolve sentience and grow to the horizon in a blooming chaos of rust, steel and concrete.\n\nIndustrial Devolution is the first long-form generative project using my rayhatching algorithm. It combines a raymarcher for SDFs with a surface orientation based flow field renderer in order to draw arbitrary 3D scenes as line art, with an organic, hatched drawing style. The SDF formulas were generatively designed and parametrized to form ancient landscapes of corroded industrial pipes and immense, ageless blocks of concrete.\n\nThe entire code of Industrial Devolution is 3930 characters, using no external libraries.\n\nWhen done rendering, the output can be right-click saved as an SVG file and plotted using a plotter such as an Axidraw. The lines in the SVG are in random order, so it is recommended to use a path reordering/optimizing tool such as axicli or vpype before plotting. This will greatly reduce the plotting time. The output SVG is intended to be plotted at A3 (297x420mm) using a 0.4mm black pen (but feel free to experiment). You can change this by adding these options to the URL:\n\n  &lw=.4 the linewidth in millimetres\n  &d=.8 the line density (multiplier to the line width, density 0.6 recommended for plotter output)\n  &h=420 how high the page is, in millimetres (width is always height * 0.707)\n  &bg=1 set to 0 to remove background rectangle (bg=0 recommended for plotter output)\n\nIndustrial Devolution was released during a live minting event at Bright Moments Gallery, Venice Beach in collaboration with Bright Moments, fx(hash) and Tender.\n",

            "description": "\"A mille-feuille (French pronunciation: ​[mil fœj], \"thousand-sheets\"), also known by the names Napoleon, vanilla slice, and custard slice, is a dessert made of puff pastry layered with pastry cream. Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.\n\nTraditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry (pâte feuilletée), alternating with two layers of pastry cream (crème pâtissière). The top pastry layer is finished in various ways: sometimes it is topped with whipped cream, or it may be dusted with icing sugar, cocoa, pastry crumbs, or sliced almonds. It may also be glazed with icing or fondant alone, or in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) or other colored icing stripes, and combed to create a marbled effect.\" — Wikipedia\n\nPrints available upon request: prints@stefancontiero.com\nBest enjoyed on browsers supporting Display-P3 color gamut.\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n@stefan_contiero\n",
