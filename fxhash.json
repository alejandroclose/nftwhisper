I added the small stick people - were they climbing up or down? Where were they going? Where did they come from?\nI then became interested in how subtle changes of background colour and changes of balloon colour changed the story, or the feeling of the story - ranging from bright hope to despair and futility. \n\nAll p5.js.\nThe artwork is rendered at window size, use keys '2' and '3' to render larger.

In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

We avoided big blocks of text and leaned into finding creative solutions to allow the artists to express themselves without having to produce new work. We also elected not to systematically showcase an artist's latest project as a way of jumping off the cultural treadmill which has conditioned us to focus almost exclusively on \"what's new\" and \"what's next\". As a result, *the seed*, which we envisage as a quarterly publication, will hopefully convey a certain quality of timelessness.\n\nThis issue is a collective invitation to catch our breath and celebrate the beauty that has been brought forth by a diverse group of amazing artists from all over the world: Lammetje, Liam Egan, Ciput, Elsif & Clint Fulkerson. Instead of asking the typical interview questions, we invited each artist to introduce themselves using a text based recording device which allows the reader to witness the workings of the artist's mind. The result feels both lighthearted and intimate.\n\nThe edition size is 128 and statistically one in five coverpages will be an animated collage created using the artwork of one of our five artists. No two coverpages are alike as the seed differs for each collage. This might be less apparent if the project is only examined through thumbnails. Please take the time to explore all of the interactive features of *the seed* on full screen.\n\n*the seed* was made with C++ and OpenGL and converted to the web via Emscripten.\n\nThank you for reading this metadata and for coming on this journey with us!",

The piece was part of a long, multi-year investigation into particle systems, agents and the aesthetic of fluid dynamics. Even though the approach used here is very primitive, my overall aim was to create a dynamic (and minimally interactive/responsive) system, which is above all mesmerizing to watch and somewhat feels alive. Since the original Java/Processing version isn't able to run anymore, I did some major updates and ported it to Zig & WebAssembly to give it a new life, more fluidity and a larger audience. Hope you enjoy!\n\n10 parametric color themes (each with variations)\n10 macro design/behavioral params (to control dozens more)\noptionally mouse/touch responsive (rotate/pulsate)...\n\nMade w/ Zig, WASM & thi.ng/umbrella",

            "description": "Root, by Matthew Plummer-Fernandez (2022). A pseudo-simulation of plant intelligence and root systems. Each root apex splinters into more apexes that follow similar trajectories in swarm-like patterns. To illustrate a basic response to their surroundings, each root system is confined to an invisible container that the root tips appear to either inspect or repel from, framing the final state. The system is sensitive to the space containing it, so it may grow in another way on different screen sizes. \n\nInspired by The Revolutionary Genius of Plants: A New Understanding of Plant Intelligence and Behavior, by scientist and author Stefano Mancuso.\n\nPress 's' key in live mode to save a png.\n\nThe code that generates this work also contains an essay titled 'Root: hashing out the concept of regenerative art'\n\nPress the '/' key (a symbol used for the 'root' directory) in live mode to save the essay as a txt file (best viewed copy/pasted into a word processor). \n\n",

            "description": "\"AN2: Recuerdos\" is an abstract collection that is the direct sequel to Artificialmente Natural. Recuerdos are memories in Spanish, and with this collection, I tried to evoke specifically that, a memory. There are many times throughout our life that our memory changes and grow. Sometimes we even alter memories unconsciously, mixing them up between other memories and even fantasy or dreams (ever had a Deja Vu?), creating a new memory solely based on an idea of the past and what it was. We live in a world of perceptions, and that is exactly what our memory is, a combination of perceptions that became ideas, made up of other older ideas and new ones, to then get stored inside our brain as new memories.\n\nNow, you may ask, cool story, but what does it have to do with the collection? Well, through your memories, experiences, and perceptions, you're going to analyze the piece. You may think you see an abstract ocean in the background, or a sky, or waves, or auras. You may feel that the art piece sometimes looks decayed, splattered with paint, or just splattered with dirty noise. The truth is that through your memory, you're going to try to make sense of it no matter if you like what you're seeing or not, and that's the sole idea of everything. Interpreting through our experiences is how we calm the tension we feel from the unknown. You can't make a comparison or an interpretation if you haven't seen or experienced something that laid an idea inside your brain, becoming multiple other ideas through plasticity and neural connectivity, always trying to make sense of everything. That's why your \"recuerdos\" is the key to the way you interpret life and live it, both unconsciously and consciously. \n\nFor me, this collection consciously reminds me of my teenage years. A little chaotic at times, with some beautiful moments of self-discovery. Mistakes were made, love was found and lost, and everything was pretty colorful and new. Unconsciously, I don't know, that's the beauty of the unknown. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTICE\n\nAllow list will be deleted 48 hours after the collections goes live.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nFYI\n\nLoading of the art goes through 3 stages in order. It may take between 30 seconds to 40 seconds to finalize.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPress [S] to save as PNG",

            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

I added the small stick people - were they climbing up or down? Where were they going? Where did they come from?\nI then became interested in how subtle changes of background colour and changes of balloon colour changed the story, or the feeling of the story - ranging from bright hope to despair and futility. \n\nAll p5.js.\nThe artwork is rendered at window size, use keys '2' and '3' to render larger.
