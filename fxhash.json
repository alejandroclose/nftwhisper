Perspective and perception can be so different.\n\nBased on some of my photos from the last 365 days that trigger emotional memories, even if they are not directly connected. By the way, Fischbach is the name of the small village where I grew up. It was a great time!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach piece uses pairs of photos and colors (top/bottom).\n\nThe animated collage itself is based on two layers. The first layer uses a double buffer to cut, colorize and animate the photos. The second layer is mainly just for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nCutting and pasting photos is based on a variable moving color grid, the fixed horizon, the variable position of the photos top/bottom, the previous buffer and some magic distance calculations between them.\n\nThe grid itself is a combination of vertical color stripes with variable position and distance factors that determine the color gradient between the two colors, and folds that alternate between the two colors depending on the horizontal and vertical values.\n\nEspecially the entropy of the photos and the colored grid influence the pixel movement.\n\nAnimation changes are triggered after a random number of frames and effect folds, stripes and photo position. These replace parts of the current collage (fade to black) or add some (discard fragment updates).\n\nFeatures:\n\n- top color [12] - hue, colorful & bright\n- bottom color [6] - hue, less colorful & bright\n- top photo [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ♠4, driften, brand-pyramide, zäpfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- bottom photo: [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ♠4, driften, brand-pyramide, zäpfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- horizon [0.618, 0.5, 0.382] (down, center, up)\n- hectic [3, 5, 11] (calm, slightly, very)\n- horizontal folds [113, 365, 997, 2153, 3987] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- vertical folds [7, 37, 127, 571, 1501, 3147] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- min stripes [1, 3, 5] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence.

            "description": "This series is about finding the beauty in discarded things. It's about seeing the potential for art in the most unexpected places and creating something new from what already exists.\n\nOne thing we love about art is that it can be a direct expression of our thoughts and feelings. But what about the happy accidents that can happen when we let go and allow the materials to guide us?\n\nI love the serendipitous moments that arise when I relinquish control, letting the materials show me the way. The printmaking process can be messy and unpredictable. I often use sheets of notebook paper to keep my workspace clean. When I’m done, I save some of the scrap sheets of paper. \n\nThe mark of a dirty brayer, drips of paint, a coffee stain, or a ripped edge can all be embraced as part of the final composition. A similar process happens in generative art, where projects can have near limitless possibilities.\n\nSheets of paper can represent many things: a blank slate, an adventure, or even noise. This project is dedicated to all the leftovers and forgotten things in the world. It's a reminder that even the smallest piece of paper can be beautiful.",

            "description": "This series is about finding the beauty in discarded things. It's about seeing the potential for art in the most unexpected places and creating something new from what already exists.\n\nOne thing we love about art is that it can be a direct expression of our thoughts and feelings. But what about the happy accidents that can happen when we let go and allow the materials to guide us?\n\nI love the serendipitous moments that arise when I relinquish control, letting the materials show me the way. The printmaking process can be messy and unpredictable. I often use sheets of notebook paper to keep my workspace clean. When I’m done, I save some of the scrap sheets of paper. \n\nThe mark of a dirty brayer, drips of paint, a coffee stain, or a ripped edge can all be embraced as part of the final composition. A similar process happens in generative art, where projects can have near limitless possibilities.\n\nSheets of paper can represent many things: a blank slate, an adventure, or even noise. This project is dedicated to all the leftovers and forgotten things in the world. It's a reminder that even the smallest piece of paper can be beautiful.",

            "description": "“We are segmented from all around and in every direction. The human being is a segmentary animal. Segmentarity is inherent to all the strata composing us. Dwelling, getting around, working, playing: life is spatially and socially segmented. The house is segmented according to its rooms’ assigned purposes; streets, according to the order of the city; the factory, according to the nature of the work and operations performed in it. We are segmented in a binary fashion, following the great major dualist oppositions: social classes, but also men-women, adult-children, and so on.” \n\n-a thousand plateaus: capitalism and schizophrenia, Deleuze and Guattari\n\nLinear Segmentarity explores the concept of a segmented existence, which refers to how our lives are broken up into discreet parts or segments.\n\nI was inspired by the philosophers Deleuze and Guattari. These thinkers studied the ways we are segmented into work and play, family and friends, and past and present. We move through our days in a series of linear segments, each one leading to the next. \n\nEach segment has its territory with its own rules and way of doing things. We are constantly shifting from one to the next, and the sum of these segments defines our existence. \n\nArt can help us visualize this hidden aspect of ourselves and feel its impact. Using Javascript to describe the sporadic nature of the world, this project invites us to see the linear segmentarity at work in our environment.\n",

Perspective and perception can be so different.\n\nBased on some of my photos from the last 365 days that trigger emotional memories, even if they are not directly connected. By the way, Fischbach is the name of the small village where I grew up. It was a great time!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach piece uses pairs of photos and colors (top/bottom).\n\nThe animated collage itself is based on two layers. The first layer uses a double buffer to cut, colorize and animate the photos. The second layer is mainly just for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nCutting and pasting photos is based on a variable moving color grid, the fixed horizon, the variable position of the photos top/bottom, the previous buffer and some magic distance calculations between them.\n\nThe grid itself is a combination of vertical color stripes with variable position and distance factors that determine the color gradient between the two colors, and folds that alternate between the two colors depending on the horizontal and vertical values.\n\nEspecially the entropy of the photos and the colored grid influence the pixel movement.\n\nAnimation changes are triggered after a random number of frames and effect folds, stripes and photo position. These replace parts of the current collage (fade to black) or add some (discard fragment updates).\n\nFeatures:\n\n- top color [12] - hue, colorful & bright\n- bottom color [6] - hue, less colorful & bright\n- top photo [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ♠4, driften, brand-pyramide, zäpfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- bottom photo: [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ♠4, driften, brand-pyramide, zäpfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- horizon [0.618, 0.5, 0.382] (down, center, up)\n- hectic [3, 5, 11] (calm, slightly, very)\n- horizontal folds [113, 365, 997, 2153, 3987] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- vertical folds [7, 37, 127, 571, 1501, 3147] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- min stripes [1, 3, 5] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 300 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar, mouse click or tap touch to trigger animation changes\n- `c` to take a picture\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `p` to pause\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- autopause - enable automatic pausing\n- pixelratio=2 - sets the pixel ratio (default: device)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=10 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

            "description": "“We are segmented from all around and in every direction. The human being is a segmentary animal. Segmentarity is inherent to all the strata composing us. Dwelling, getting around, working, playing: life is spatially and socially segmented. The house is segmented according to its rooms’ assigned purposes; streets, according to the order of the city; the factory, according to the nature of the work and operations performed in it. We are segmented in a binary fashion, following the great major dualist oppositions: social classes, but also men-women, adult-children, and so on.” \n\n-a thousand plateaus: capitalism and schizophrenia, Deleuze and Guattari\n\nLinear Segmentarity explores the concept of a segmented existence, which refers to how our lives are broken up into discreet parts or segments.\n\nI was inspired by the philosophers Deleuze and Guattari. These thinkers studied the ways we are segmented into work and play, family and friends, and past and present. We move through our days in a series of linear segments, each one leading to the next. \n\nEach segment has its territory with its own rules and way of doing things. We are constantly shifting from one to the next, and the sum of these segments defines our existence. \n\nArt can help us visualize this hidden aspect of ourselves and feel its impact. Using Javascript to describe the sporadic nature of the world, this project invites us to see the linear segmentarity at work in our environment.\n",

This may be what is often referred to as introversion and shyness. However, our inner world is often very full of emotions. We have that one switch or lock on the door of our heart that is usually closed. It's used to protect ourselves, or to hide ourselves. But, we also need that one moment to let the budding emotions inside us blossom. Yes, maybe it's now! It's time to untie that knot that's been tied for a long time, let the cheer be released, let's cheers, and let's celebrate!\n\nPress [s] to save the image.\n\nBy Samuel YAN\nMade with p5.js / glsl",
