            "description": "\"Stepping Stones\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Performance in Code: Deciphering Value in Generative Art, Art Basel Miami Beach, 2022\n\nStepping Stones explores the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Simple patterns, shapes, textures, and colors are arranged in randomly selected ways. Overlaying shapes distort and blend, breaking these objects apart and causing complex forms to emerge. Combining these individual features together results in varying outcomes, from surprisingly simple to wildly chaotic.\n\n---------------\n\nControls:\nPress 1-6 to change the scale of the canvas (1 = default, 2500px x 2500px, 6 = 15,000px x 15,000px)\nS (or double tap on mobile): Save output at current size\nC: Toggle cutout shapes visibility\nH: Toggle cutout outlines visibility\nB: Iterate border sizes (none, default, 1.5x, 2x, 3x)\nT: Toggle texture visibility\nF: Toggle fullscreen\nAdd the url params x and y to set custom dimensions. For example, add &x=1500&y=500 for a 1500px x 500px image\n\n---------------\n\nTyler Boswell (@teaboswell) 2022\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0, See bundle.js.LICENSE.txt for third party license information",

            "description": "🎧 CLICK/TAP FOR SOUND ON\n\nSaṅkhāra is a portrait of symbolic consciousness in three movements.\n\nColorful automata represents direct experience: touch, sight, hearing, smell, taste and thought in a ceaseless flow of novelty.\n\nThe automata congeals into form alluding to the way our minds close over experience with symbolic representation, like a plastic bag coming down over a kaleidoscope of butterflies. What was free in the open air is now trapped. What was previously wild and unpredictable is now under control, frozen and communicable.\n\nThe form’s dispersal mimics the release of mental formation, the unbinding of a symbol, the letting go of a belief. It’s a visceral reflection of the process of ceasing to identify with separateness. To strain the previous metaphor, it’s the opening of the bag and letting the butterflies return to the flow of raw, boundless experience.\n\n—\n\nK.C. Austin\nFrom his cockpit in the Blue Ridge Mountains K.C. Austin (aka bzor) spends his days shaping realtime software art systems of all stripes. Informed by game design, modular synths, virtual reality and consciousness research, K.C. plays shaders like a fiddle and fashions creative pipelines like a spider spins webs.\n\nJames Paterson\nFascinated by the relationship between ancient and futuristic mediums, James Paterson has been exploring a unique synthesis of drawing, code, animation and sculpture under the moniker ‘Presstube’ since 1999. Paterson draws inspiration from meditation, molecular biology, music, parenting and psychedelics - the seen, the heard, the felt, the cognized.",

            "description": "The initial spark for this piece started with Armin Hofmann’s exercises in style and composition. Just as George Nelson wrote in the preface to Armin’s book Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practices: \"Despite all our efforts to simplify things - efforts constantly expanding in order to keep abreast of steadily increasing complexity - nothing is very simple anymore\", these explorations just opened doors to other issues, and further grounded the idea that \"if problems can be correctly stated, they can be solved.\"\n\nArmin suggests we go back to the beginning, to concern ourselves with dots and circles and lines and then bring opposed components in confrontation. \"Confrontation is a theme on which variations can be played with any desired consonances, with any imaginable values, and in a great variety of ways. [...] (Only then) (s)he will be able to find creative solutions to the problems presented by the confrontation of opposites.\"\n\nVery quickly opposed components, even with extending the angle of vision from the two-dimensional surface to the three-dimensional space, and with the contrasts of thin-thick, solid-transparent, softened-hardened line, etc., started looking like I’m weaving complicated plots, visually similar to textile works by  Bauhaus women - Gunta Stölzl, Anni Albers, Gertrud Preiswerk and others.\n\nWhen Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919, he proclaimed that “every eligible person whose talent and training are considered adequate will be accepted without regard to age and sex.” However, in practice, discriminatory gender roles were reinforced, and female students were guided and advised to work with textiles rather than in workshops for heavy crafts such as carpentry. Despite that, Gropius’s “women’s section” became one of its most collaborative and brave experimental sectors. \n\nA hundred years later, it is disappointing to see we still carry on with inherited gender roles. Check the number of female computer science students in your country. How are things going \"at the intersection of arts and technology\"? I've implemented some of the percentages from Serbia in the distribution of shapes in the final compositions. I sampled the number of female vs. male students at the Faculty of Mathematics and the University of Arts (where I studied and now work), and gender distribution among graduated students, and it didn't look bad at all. But then I realized I'm the only female professor (out of 5) teaching main subjects at doctoral studies program in digital arts.\n\n\"When a group is underrepresented, people come to take that underrepresentation as the norm.\" Since representation is imperative to achieving equality, it is equally critical to change the biases we’ve developed over centuries.\n\nFor the title, I chose a dated version of the word for a female weaver on purpose. My native language is one of the Slavic languages, which are all gender sensitive. It is natural to have feminitives, but since historically some occupations were less (or not at all) practiced by women, many of the feminitives for those professions, jobs, and specializations are rarely used or don't exist in the dictionary. Also, not surprisingly, the dominant version of the noun describing a person who weaves in Serbian would be the female noun \"tkalja\", whereas the male version is so rare that is missing from some dictionaries. Conscientiously choosing the female version of the noun for the title, I position myself and this piece in the historical context with Bauhaus weveresses, contemporary language, and gender contexts, and finally in the curatorial context of the exhibition. \n\nCode Weaveresses is part of the FEMGEN exhibition curated by Micol Ap @verticalcrypoto in partnership with @RtClick_Save and @artblocks_io.\n",

Trees are data structures very much used in computer science and I worked on the random generation of these structures. It seemed interesting to me to make a link between the digital world (and these trees) and nature in danger. The 3 dead trees refer to the old beliefs of the south of France, while questioning us on the mutations of the world, and the risk to neglect our planet. Are the trees of the computer science the dead trees of our forests? To complete my work, I added a red sun, which is in fact a zonotopal subdivision (a complex mathematical object), that is to say a kind of tiling with rhombuses. I wanted to give a Japanese touch to my work, I love the minimalist poetry of Japanese gardens where everything is in its place and in harmony.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
