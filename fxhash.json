Would the AI ​​that created these mysterious gardens have memories of the scent of flowers in its brain?\nNo matter how well a machine imitates the human learning process, it has inherent limitations. Humans remember the situation by comprehensively utilizing the five senses, including not only the visual information of the flowers, but also the melodies that flowed at that moment, the buzzing of flying bees, the dizzying scent of flowers, and the warm sunlight. However, this AI only does fractional numerical calculations using only the given pixel RGB values.\n\nHumans with much more complex brains and computational systems are passionate about the images that AI creates. However, if you think about it a little, it seems that this interest may be a kind of leisurely relaxation for mature beings to watch the development of immature beings.\nThis AI doesn't even know what it just built.\n\n\n* Draw algorithmic strokes by reference the color of AI-generated flower garden.\n* One of 832 AI-generated seed images are randomly selected.\n* No property(traits), no rarity\n\n[Left click on the screen] : add strokes (Temporarily retouching)\n[S] Save to file\n\nMade with Love & P5.js & P5.beizer !\nNFT License 2.0\nBy CSLIM, 2022\n",

If we were Will’s baby, we’d be sitting up and prepping to crawl — the literal baby steps that precede an entire lifetime of movement. \n\nPlay is another integral part of our development. Play teaches us to connect, laugh, share, love, and learn. It helps form our earliest friendships that mold us into who we are destined to become. Over the last six months we have had the immense pleasure of forming new relationships with some of the amazing artists that comprise of the fxhash community. \n\nIt is the love and support of new friends Laurent Houdard, Ada Ada Ada, elsif, and Camille Roux that made our first (official) collaboration possible. Thank you so much for the idea, the vision, the art, the time, and the wrangling to make this possible. \n\nEach letter is imbued with the unique style of an artist, based on a framework created by Laurent. There is a small chance of receiving a piece with two of the same style, with the rarest possibility of receiving one with all four quadrants the same. \n\nCollect with love and the knowledge that your support means the world to us. Thank you for listening every week, and for the messages and stories that you share with us. We can’t wait to continue to grow.\n\nThank you so much again to Laurent, Ada, elsif, and Camille. This is what community is.",

            "description": "The Corium is a roughly spherical mass (diameter ~1km), of currently unknown origins situated within the core region of the solar system's asteroid belt.\nThe body was discovered during a uranium extraction mission undertaken by ET Resources at the behest of Station 733-H (Mars colony) leadership, when ionising radiation levels detected by deployed surface craft exceeded equipment and personnel tolerance levels by many orders of magnitude.\n\nWhile ETR crew were quick to respond to local abort orders (27 minutes from initial readings to fleet reorientation); Station 733-H made the determination that radiation exposure levels were already far in excess of anything that could be reasonably mitigated upon the ETR fleet's return.\nThe ETR fleet was ordered to jettison fuel reserves under Section 9 of the Space Corporations Act (Mars) approximately 90 minutes after the readings were initially reported. It is understood that all deployed personnel accessed their barbiturate rations within the following 24 hours.\n\nThe fleet itself remains in position some ~3000kms from The Corium, with plans to relocate the vessels still underway (albeit a low priority).\n\n\nSTATION 733-H OBSERVATION REPORT SUMMARY (14.1.1)\n\nTo date, remote analysis suggests that the body is compositionally similar to corium deposits observed following terrestrial nuclear disasters, consisting of a range of solidified radioactive compounds as well as a number of currently unidentified metal alloys. More in-depth analysis has been impossible to date due to the rapid physical decay of personnel and equipment as their proximity to samples reach a critical threshold.\n\nAll samples have so far been extruded from the surface of The Corium via laser, and maneuvered into orbit around Mars at the edge of it's sphere of influence (at a distance of no less than 50,000kms from Station 733-H), via projectile barrage and gas envelopment.\n\nThe surface of The Corium itself is littered with an array of clearly engineered forms; radial and rectangular patterns, deep crevasses, mazes and grids with only a select few areas resembling the pools of lava observed where Corium has formed terrestrially (it is unclear whether these deposits have formed since the surface was initially engineered).\n\nThe accompanying files are LIDAR renders of the extracted samples in proximity to Station 733-H and are marked for dissemination to terrestrial research teams on Mars. Study of The Corium remains the sole priority of Station 733-H research personnel, as any risks presented to the solar system or its inhabitants are currently not well understood.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe piece will render from the top right and might take ~5-10 seconds to begin.\n\nAppend \"&print=true\" to the live render URL for a hi-res output.",

Some may seem more beautiful than others but they all have the same internals.\n\n---\nFeatures info\n---\n\nDark mode - Paint the background black\nMonochrome - No colors just grays\nEmitter mode - One of the following: EDGE, SHAPE, POINT, GRID\n\nNumber Of Shapes - How many shapes are on the scene (1-4)\nNumber of Rays - How many rays are emitted (100-1000)\nNumber of Bounces - How many times the rays bounce (2-3)\nRay spreading - How much the ray angles are spread (10-100)\n\nColor mode - Either SMOOTH or STEPS\nColor spectrum size - How wide hue spectrum is used\nColor spectrum offset - How much the hue is offset\nColor step interval - How many consecutive rays should have the same color\nColor step count - How many steps is the color spectrum divided into",

            "description": "This project is about uncovering artifacts.\n\nEach piece is determined by approximately 15 parameters. This allows for a multitude of possible forms, and each iteration is an artifact to be discovered within the multidimensional space.\n\nThis work is focused around discovery. It is about exploring the space of the algorithm, shedding light on its many forms, and sometimes finding artifacts of the real world embedded within them.\n\nTechnically, this work is a composition of three primary elements: Voronoi tessellations, orthographic projection, and the depth-sort algorithm.\nThe latter of these is integral to the rendering mechanism. It works intuitively, drawing distant objects before near objects, evaluating the distance of each object according to its geometric center. It does this precisely, and in doing so, it can produce interesting visual artifacts, drawing some shapes in an unexpected order.\n\n\n\nThis has been a fascinating study, bringing light to unreal shapes and forms, and uncovering artifacts in an impossible space.\n\nI hope you enjoy it,\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Notes:\n- Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done.",

They live a cyclical life marked by two big stages during their livestock year: \"La Veranada\" and \"La Invernada\".\nThe \"invernada\" is the place where they live during what we could call the long winter, that is, from April to November. \"La Invernada\" is below, in the plains, in the pampas, in accessible places, where it is easy to supply the animals with fodder.\n\"La Veranada\" is the place where they go during the long summer, from November to April, it is above, in the mountain ranges, on the heights, where the summer pastures abound, where they go for months to take care, alone, of the goats, cows and calves.\nThe transfer of the animals to the summer pasture is called \"Arreo\", my mother's husband guides the animals on his horse. The \"Arreo\" lasts about 5 days.\nIn both places they live in what they call \"el puesto\". \"El puesto\" is their home.\nIn \"La veranada\", \"El puesto\" is simple. A common living room, with a wood stove, a table, some chairs and shelves to store flour, *\"mate\" and salt. A small bedroom replenishes the strength worn out by the daily work. Water for drinking, cooking and washing is drawn from a nearby stream.\nWork is abundant. As a common element, both in winter and summer, my mother's husband rides a horse daily and, accompanied by his dogs, goes to \"watch\" the cattle.\nAs a final point I wanted to thank you for taking your time and reading the story behind this project that I really enjoyed doing it, and on my tw profile you can read this story with real photos.\n\n*Mate: is an Argentinean infusion, which is present all day long in the life of people who live in the countryside. It give you energy.\n\nPress \"S\" in live mode to save image 2600 x 3000.\nPlease note that the algorithm can take some time to run.\nCreated by Fernando. NFT License 2.0.",
