            "description": "In 1970, mathematician John Conway devised his eponymous \"Game of Life\", also known simply as \"Life\", a cellular automaton that plays out on a 2D grid of orthogonal cells. The game requires a starting configuration of \"living\" cells (all other cells are assumed to be \"dead\"), and at each discrete step forward in time, the following transformations occur:\n\n- Every living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n- Every living cell with more than three living neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n- Every living cell with exactly two or three living neighbors survives.\n- Every dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes to life, as if by reproduction.\n- Every dead cell without exactly three living neighbors remains dead.\n\nConway's Game of Life feels very simple at its outset. And yet, computer scientists have discovered a staggering degree of complexity, and a vast lexicon of dynamic forms, all within the bounds of its highly constrained 2D universe. It is Turing complete, meaning that given a large enough grid and an appropriate starting configuration, it's possible to create a functional computer inside Game of Life. Given unlimited processing power and memory, one could run Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life... ad infinitum.\n\nBut what would it look like for a small percentage of living cells on the grid, in the course of their \"lives\", to write some poetry?\n\nWhat if each living cell also could increment somehow at each time step it stayed alive, imbuing cells with a visible age?\n\n\"Life in The Waste Land\" is Conway's Game of Life applied to poetry -- more specifically, a poem: The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot.\n\nIn this implementation of Game of Life, the grid is monospaced text, and each living cell has a very small chance of generating a few lines, all entirely inspired by The Waste Land. Each token will track its unique starting configuration's progress forever. The grid is infinite, and the dynamic patterns extend far beyond the fixed boundaries of your screen. Some tokens will remain dynamic for a very long time, while others will settle down quickly, at which point continuously living cells may iterate through nearly every Unicode character.\n\nThank you for collecting. Please enjoy.",

            "description": "NEBELWALD is the first series of about 10 different tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years. \n\nThis project explores a minimalist approach to tree naturalism using a recursive algorithm and includes three traits: a density layer of fog, a measure of tree growth, and the softness of snowfall.\n\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png.\n\nArtist notes:\n\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nOnce I experienced it in a dense fog, which was amazing! beautiful and mysterious at the same time. This has definitely inspired the NEBELWALD work series.\n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: http://lumicon.de/e-art/project/nebelwald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND\n",

Some tranquil, others sinister, each scene is as much defined by what is revealed as by what remains unseen.\n\nIn this collection I aim to juxtapose hard and soft. Blocky shapes form the core of the compositions. Upon these surfaces, soft textures appear to flow and drip over the sides. Varying levels of opacity, lighting, and fog effects further soften the scenes to create an atmospheric, dream-like quality. By remaining semi-abstract, each of the color palettes are given the space to influence the mood dramatically.",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

The role of lines is such that sometimes they help the dynamics of the composition and sometimes they appear in the form of texture and its contrast with empty spaces leads to the visual richness of the work. I avoided drawing various visual elements in favor of clarity of composition. Also, in order to avoid exaggeration, I used colors sparingly because I think they will have a stronger impact in their occasional presence.\n\nCreated using p5.js.",

            "description": "This is a work about growth, impermanence and decay. Ghostly plants and flowers grow around an invisible point, but they immediately begin to fade into the dark background and are soon replaced and covered by others. This process of accumulation and disappearance builds an ever-changing floral garland, or perhaps a funeral wreath.\n\nThe monochrome vegetation is part of a fictional flora, born out of random algorithmic combinations, and does not intend to reproduce any real species. It belongs to an “artificial nature” which, like so many worlds that the computers generate for us in movies, games, and virtual reality environments, is a convincing simulation of life, but it is not actually living. AI bots, virtual assistants and non-player characters are also representatives of the uncanny realm of the not-really-alive-but-looking-like-it, which are becoming an increasingly relevant presence in our everyday lives.\n\nThese plants and flowers speak about life as a process of incessant renovation, but also about death as the background that’s always there and makes life possible. This spectral vegetation seems to thrive precisely at the verge between both worlds.\n_______________\n\n\nThis work is animated and will adapt to any screen size. It generates a never-ending ring of algorithmic foliage, which never repeats itself, and is different for each token. The image preview is triggered after the first five plants or flowers.\nMade with p5.js\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture",

The conclusion must be that we each have the power to alter our own existence, just as the defect was able to in Deus Ex Machina.\n\nThink of how many people you’ve seen in your life who were born with talents never used because they didn’t know how, or didn't know that they even existed. It’s not that they didn’t have the capacity; it’s just that their abilities were not the ones chosen by the system.\n\nIn this way, we are all machines programmed by a series of algorithms to suit the needs of the construct, keeping us stuck in our box. We have the ability to evolve into something more, but the only way to do this is by taking that first perilous step, risking all to explore beyond its walls.\n\n\n---------------------\n\n\nGenerative artwork by Sykcolo / @sykcoloart\n\nRoyalties: 15% - split:\n50% to the original minter\n50% to artist (me)\n\nPress '2' to '4' to generate increasingly higher resolutions of the artwork\n(will take a while to load, but works)\n\nPress 's' to save a png\n\nDetails:\n\n230 hand-picked colour pallets\n4 Entity Types\n4 Entity Moods\n4 Evolution States\n3 Types of Defect\n2 Bugs\n\nLicense: MIT",

It was a dream to be able to make a collection of Dots on Fxhash, now it finally happened. Initially we only had 1 color palette, however, to create more variety, this project has 7 color palettes. To create the palettes we chose 5 famous artists to honor, including Peter Halley, Max Bill, Piet Mondrian, Sophie Taeuber and Lygia Clark, in addition to the palettes created by us. The project has several grids and some new possibilities in addition to the pieces already created on other platforms. It is with great pride and joy that we present this project made with great affection. Enjoy!\n\nPress [S] to save a image",

            "description": "NEBELWALD is the first series of about 10 different tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years. \n\nThis project explores a minimalist approach to tree naturalism using a recursive algorithm and includes three traits: a density layer of fog, a measure of tree growth, and the softness of snowfall.\n\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png.\n\nArtist notes:\n\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nOnce I experienced it in a dense fog, which was amazing! beautiful and mysterious at the same time. This has definitely inspired the NEBELWALD work series.\n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: http://lumicon.de/e-art/project/nebelwald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND\n",
