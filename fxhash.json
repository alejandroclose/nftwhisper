            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "Barrage (/bəˈrɑʒ/ french for dam) is a project that proposes a narrative by invoking a game of radical composition. The program traverses a texture, searching for gaps in depth. When it identifies deep areas, it will draw lines, and when they are high, it will write text. The texture will then define the width and height of the letters and the direction of the lines. \n\nRandomly for each edition, the text will be written vertically or horizontally, but it will always be repeated, becoming a kind of incantation, a statement that is repeated endlessly while awaiting the intervention of a higher power, but also like an instruction in code that will be executed a certain number of times or until a condition is met.\n\nTextures and texts hybridize, the text is no longer flat but in motion, altered by a Perlin noise that renders it illegible in places and, at other times, enlarged, dominating the rest of the composition. Like an elocution, the text now has a rhythm, its acceleration and its hollows: it comes alive.\n\n___\n\nClick on the edition to generate an image (PNG) or a vector (SVG).\n\nYou are free to plot your edition by your own and if you want a signed edition you can use the great feature \"reedemable\" of fxhash to order a small (A4) or a large (A3) plotter drawing of your edition.\n\nProject setup with thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nUsing thi.ng/umbrella, nclslbrn/plotter-writer and simplex-noise packages.\n\n2024 Nicolas Lebrun",

Kagami (Japanese for 'mirror') arranges it's polygons in reflected symmetry, creating patterns reminiscent of kaleidoscopes and snowflakes. Mixed color palettes alternate between reflections to incorporate a level of asymmetry. As opposed to previous Hatchet pieces, the chance of generating a light and dark background is equal.\n\nAll pieces in Hatchet are composed to emulate the aesthetic of colored pencils on paper. Each piece is capable of exporting its hatch lines as a well-labeled SVG document. This will allow collectors interested in plotting to create physical renditions of their iteration.\n\nThe following key-press actions are supported on the token:\n- 'r': Animate the erasure and re-drawing of the hatch lines.\n- 's': Export the SVG document describing the arrangement of hatch lines.",

Please proceed bearing this in mind.\n\nExperiment with the aspect ratio of this piece using the ‘open live’ function below the viewport - it can be enjoyed elastically [as with my previous works here]. A larger frame provides for a deeper experience.\n\nAs with a handful of my works, an instance of .blend() is used in this piece, and does cause some slight thinning and dimming to the preview capture. Once more, this still preview is to be considered a skeletal scan of a moment within this piece.",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "This piece explores humanity's vanity and obsession with controlling natural forces. In the end we are beholden to the whims of the universe and its rules. What we think is artificial is but nature's inclination.\n\nAs an atom gazes at the world it can see the arrogant hand of mankind imposing its will. We are nature's inane creation built from imperceptible, discrete particles.\n\nEnjoy watching the structures form. Due to the nature of the system it may take some time to complete. Once it's fully rendered you can download a full resolution image of 3508 x 4961 px by ***double clicking/tapping***. At this size the piece is printable at A3 size at 300 dpi. If you're interested in acquiring a signed print please contact @KRANKARTA.\n\nFeatures include: palette, orientation, architecture, particle rules, boundary seepage and colour displacement.\n\nCreated on Chrome desktop 103.0 on 2022-07-21 in javascript and GLSL.
