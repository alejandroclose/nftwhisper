            "description": "“Shape Observation” is the first episode of “The Restoration Scheme” Series. The work was based on Staghorn Coral. \n\nLiving on the land, we have few opportunities to see corals in real life.\nMost of my impressions of corals come from photos and illustrations.\nSo I think the first person who discovers coral must be stunned by its shape and color.\nThey may paint hundreds of pictures like this.\n\n——\n\n“The Restoration Scheme” Series\n\nIt’s a virtual action extended from the coral restoration plan led by Delta Electronics Foundation from Taiwan, consisting of five generative corals. Each of them was based on five different species of coral as the theme.\n\nIf collectors mint virtual corals, Delta Electronics Foundation will drop coral seedlings collectively in the sea. \n\nThe project is powered by FAB DAO (Formosa Art Bank). The split will donate to the local organization from Taiwan dedicated to the coral restoration scheme.\n\n——\n\nAbout Delta \n\nClimate change is causing irreversible impacts. Coral reefs, known for their rich biodiversity and the capability to nourish a quarter of marine life, are at the forefront of the crisis. \n\nAlso known as \"tropical rainforests\" in the sea, coral reefs have experienced five mass bleaching events in the past five years. Once global warming exceeds the 2˚C thresholds, it's likely that 99% of coral reefs will die off worldwide.\n\nIn addition to launching a coral restoration initiative along the northeast coast of Taiwan, Delta Electronics Foundation collaborates with Asia University to host \"Earth Pulsing: Nurturing Life Exhibition\" and releases the first art NFT featuring coral restoration. Through these actions, we hope to evoke public awareness of ecological issues. \n\nFor more information, please visit https://delta50.deltaww.com/initiative/sea.html\n\n——\n\nFeatures\nIterations: 1 ~ 4\nTail: round, sharp\nFeathering: yes, no\nColor yes, no\nPaper: normal, colored, white\nWeight: regular, thin, bold\nSpecial: -\nGrowth Speed: regular, slow, super slow\n\ndouble click or press 's' to save as an image\n\nmade with p5.js\n\n____________________________\n\n《形狀觀察》為《恢復方案》系列第一作，品種為鹿角軸孔珊瑚。\n\n在陸地上生活的我們其實能實際見到珊瑚的機會不多，我想起珊瑚的印象，最多是來自照片與畫。\n於是想起了第一個發現珊瑚的人，一定會為他的形狀與顏色感到驚嘆不已。\n所以我想像，他也許曾經畫下上百張類似這樣的畫面。\n\n——\n\n《恢復方案》\n恢復方案是虛擬演算珊瑚實驗，一系列共五件的生成珊瑚作品，每一件對應到特定珊瑚物種。本實驗與台達電子文教基金會合作，藏家每收藏一件 NFT，台達電子文教基金會就會實際在海中植下一株對應的珊瑚苗。\n\n這項專案與 FAB DAO （福爾摩沙藝術銀行）支援鑄造，部分分潤將直接捐助給台灣在地珊瑚保育組織，詳細資訊將於 FAB DAO Twitter 公佈。\n\n——\n\n關於台達電子文教基金會\n\n氣候變遷引發許多不可逆的環境衝擊，以豐富生物多樣性著稱、滋養四分之一海洋生物的珊瑚，便是首當其衝的受害者。\n\n被譽為「海中熱帶雨林」的珊瑚生態系，已在最近五年遭遇三次大白化，一旦升溫跨越攝氏2℃，屆時恐有多達99％的珊瑚瀕臨滅絕。\n\n近年在東北角投入珊瑚復育的台達電子文教基金會，今年與亞洲大學共同策畫「地球˙脈動中」生態與藝術特展，並合作發行全台首見的珊瑚生成藝術NFT，喚起社會大眾對生態議題的重視。\n\n更多資訊可參考: https://delta50.deltaww.com/initiative/sea.html",

            "description": "Toccata is a piece about decay, about the impermanent. The emergence over time or, rather, progression of entropy is a key characteristic of our universe. Everything evolves to nothing. We as mortal beings have sometimes trouble reconciling with this idea. Humans have sought immortality for millennia, be it through ancient potions or modern medicine, be it from leaving a legacy that we feel will stand the test of time. It will, only to decay later than us.\n\nToccata is a piece about change. Change lies at the heart of human cognition and human nature. Our thoughts and our emotions happen over time, and are a function of the change that is both around us and at the very core of our selves. Change comes in nature in cycles. Seasons of growth, seasons of ripe fruits of life, seasons of decay, of death, rebirth.\n\nToccata is music. We find music to convey some of the deepest streams of human condition, connecting it to some other form of being. Music also happens over time, and music happens because of change. Music encodes our feelings better than any other aid we may have. Toccata incorporates this at its very core, as the main sound is Andreas' family piano where he learned to play, sampled this past July.\n\nRead more about the piece, and the collaboration between Marcelo and Andreas on andreasrau.eu/toccata\n\n---\n\nBasic controls:\n- Click on the piece or press spacebar to start it (WebAudio requires user intervention for the music to start). Once the music has started, again click or press spacebar to play/pause.\n- Press “s” to save a still at the current resolution\n- Press “r” to start recording a video at the current resolution, then “r” again to stop.\n\n---\n\nWebM audio-video recording performed using the library RecordRTC by https://muazkhan.com/, MIT licence.",

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. www.tribute-hwf.com\n\n\"Since the classical age of Greece, the golden ratio has been well known as the most balanced and therefore most aesthetically perfect proportion. In fact, it is supposedly often found in the fine arts and architecture and it is certainly important in geometry. But where is the proof that it is really the most beautiful proportion?\n\n\"The computer is proving to be a useful tool in exact art theory. Works of computer art are produced with the help of programs that describe the logic of the construction and its relevant measures. By varying the parameters you can vary the shapes of objects, and on the basis of the reaction of the public you can determine the best option. So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n\"A statistical evaluation would be interesting. Please email me with your results for the optimal proportion.\"\n\nI found it heartwarming that in 2011, Herbert W. Franke wrote the above, accompanied with a simple functional program on a Wolfram Demonstration page (https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/IsTheGoldenRatioReallyTheMostBeautifulProportion/) titled 'Is the Golden Ratio Really the Most Beautiful Proportion?' and invited people to submit their findings to him.\n\nThe main idea behind this project is ratios, a variety of them, used in a variety of ways, such as how a rectangle is repeatedly subdivided, or how it influences the aspect ratio of the piece, or how the colors in a palette are selected. These are represented in various styles, some of which are inspired by the aesthetic of Herbert W. Franke's diverse artworks, and his openness to experimentation with new technologies, such as plotter drawings, screens, screenprints, or 2D and 3D digital renderings.\n\nThis project, while not designed to be a formal statistical evaluation, is but my fun, colorful, and humble response to your inquiry, dear Herbert.\n\n---\n\n25% of primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke, with the goal of raising 20,000 Euros so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any money raised beyond this goal will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• Double-click/tap or 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n\nNote: Some mints require WEBGL and/or may take several seconds to fully render.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid",

Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch F(ree). A gift to all Sketch A-E collectors. The underlying grid structure from A-E remains, but more variation on size and distribution is added. Many more color palettes are introduced. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch F(ree). A gift to all Sketch A-E collectors. The underlying grid structure from A-E remains, but more variation on size and distribution is added. Many more color palettes are introduced. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.",

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. www.tribute-hwf.com\n\n\"Since the classical age of Greece, the golden ratio has been well known as the most balanced and therefore most aesthetically perfect proportion. In fact, it is supposedly often found in the fine arts and architecture and it is certainly important in geometry. But where is the proof that it is really the most beautiful proportion?\n\n\"The computer is proving to be a useful tool in exact art theory. Works of computer art are produced with the help of programs that describe the logic of the construction and its relevant measures. By varying the parameters you can vary the shapes of objects, and on the basis of the reaction of the public you can determine the best option. So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n\"A statistical evaluation would be interesting. Please email me with your results for the optimal proportion.\"\n\nI found it heartwarming that in 2011, Herbert W. Franke wrote the above, accompanied with a simple functional program on a Wolfram Demonstration page (https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/IsTheGoldenRatioReallyTheMostBeautifulProportion/) titled 'Is the Golden Ratio Really the Most Beautiful Proportion?' and invited people to submit their findings to him.\n\nThe main idea behind this project is ratios, a variety of them, used in a variety of ways, such as how a rectangle is repeatedly subdivided, or how it influences the aspect ratio of the piece, or how the colors in a palette are selected. These are represented in various styles, some of which are inspired by the aesthetic of Herbert W. Franke's diverse artworks, and his openness to experimentation with new technologies, such as plotter drawings, screens, screenprints, or 2D and 3D digital renderings.\n\nThis project, while not designed to be a formal statistical evaluation, is but my fun, colorful, and humble response to your inquiry, dear Herbert.\n\n---\n\n25% of primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke, with the goal of raising 20,000 Euros so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any money raised beyond this goal will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• Double-click/tap or 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n\nNote: Some mints require WEBGL and/or may take several seconds to fully render.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid",
