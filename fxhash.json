            "description": "\"Chaos Culture\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\n《西遊記》第一回:「混沌未分天地亂，茫茫渺渺無人見。」\n\nChaos Culture is the final chapter of this series. There is a legend in the East that before Pan Gu opened up the sky and created the earth, the world was a chaotic place, and no one knew its appearance. And I have always been fascinated by this mythical story since he was a child.\n\nThese three works have a father-son relationship, Research > Memory > Culture, with each work re-growing through the remnants of the previous work, depending on its image. From the beginning of the creative coding, I like the concept of recursion the most. Here I experiment with my central thinking through this iterative relationship so that the work is not only the shadow of the artist but also the pulling force of repetition.\n\n\"混沌\" Chaos in Eastern culture represents the initial state of things. This state is consistent with what we believe in generative art: Anything can happen if different forces are applied. Letting chaos grow out of order and then destroying it, the iterative process, is like my usual dialogue with myself, and maybe it's all just a diary.\n\nThrough these three series of works, whether I can eventually find everything in my childhood fantasy, I am not sure yet. The only thing I can be sure of is that I will continue to explore.\n\n- Click the mouse to save an artwork.\n- Collectors who own this NFT have the right to print the work.\n\nArtist: Aluan Wang (ileivoivm).\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "\"Chaos Culture\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\n《西遊記》第一回:「混沌未分天地亂，茫茫渺渺無人見。」\n\nChaos Culture is the final chapter of this series. There is a legend in the East that before Pan Gu opened up the sky and created the earth, the world was a chaotic place, and no one knew its appearance. And I have always been fascinated by this mythical story since he was a child.\n\nThese three works have a father-son relationship, Research > Memory > Culture, with each work re-growing through the remnants of the previous work, depending on its image. From the beginning of the creative coding, I like the concept of recursion the most. Here I experiment with my central thinking through this iterative relationship so that the work is not only the shadow of the artist but also the pulling force of repetition.\n\n\"混沌\" Chaos in Eastern culture represents the initial state of things. This state is consistent with what we believe in generative art: Anything can happen if different forces are applied. Letting chaos grow out of order and then destroying it, the iterative process, is like my usual dialogue with myself, and maybe it's all just a diary.\n\nThrough these three series of works, whether I can eventually find everything in my childhood fantasy, I am not sure yet. The only thing I can be sure of is that I will continue to explore.\n\n- Click the mouse to save an artwork.\n- Collectors who own this NFT have the right to print the work.\n\nArtist: Aluan Wang (ileivoivm).\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "\"Chaos Culture\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\n《西遊記》第一回:「混沌未分天地亂，茫茫渺渺無人見。」\n\nChaos Culture is the final chapter of this series. There is a legend in the East that before Pan Gu opened up the sky and created the earth, the world was a chaotic place, and no one knew its appearance. And I have always been fascinated by this mythical story since he was a child.\n\nThese three works have a father-son relationship, Research > Memory > Culture, with each work re-growing through the remnants of the previous work, depending on its image. From the beginning of the creative coding, I like the concept of recursion the most. Here I experiment with my central thinking through this iterative relationship so that the work is not only the shadow of the artist but also the pulling force of repetition.\n\n\"混沌\" Chaos in Eastern culture represents the initial state of things. This state is consistent with what we believe in generative art: Anything can happen if different forces are applied. Letting chaos grow out of order and then destroying it, the iterative process, is like my usual dialogue with myself, and maybe it's all just a diary.\n\nThrough these three series of works, whether I can eventually find everything in my childhood fantasy, I am not sure yet. The only thing I can be sure of is that I will continue to explore.\n\n- Click the mouse to save an artwork.\n- Collectors who own this NFT have the right to print the work.\n\nArtist: Aluan Wang (ileivoivm).\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "In the dreamlike landscape of our minds, the specter of fears is like a wraith, ever-present and ethereal. It whispers in our ear, reminding us of all the things we dare not face. It is a shadow that falls across our hearts, casting a pall of doubt and uncertainty. But even as it haunts us, we must remember that it is a part of us. We must learn to accept its presence, and to use it to our advantage. For fear is not always a curse, it is a guide that shows us where we must grow stronger. It is a companion that walks with us through the dark night, illuminating the path ahead. By embracing our fears, we find the courage to face them, and to overcome them. We find the strength to live fully, to love fiercely, and to pursue our dreams with abandon.\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nSpecter of Fears by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2023\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

It doesn't matter, you did it right. Your accomplishments will serve well the next generations in their journeys, in their search for themselves.\n\nNow it's time to stop, time to take a moment and contemplate the vast universe.\n\nSoon all of this will be ending.\n\nYou did it right.\n\nEmbrace the void.\n=========\n=========\n\n\n./ Color scheme (feature)\nThere are 12 color schemes and with each set, specific arrays for color collections for the space, stars, planet, and accent colors. \n\nThese are color schemes in the known universe of \"In the Edge\":\n- Mars visions\n- Cyberpunk\n- Unknown passenger \n- Renegade\n- Primary\n- Coral\n- r.e.d.\n- Machines of an ancient-future \n- The void\n- Tinted light \n- Malibu dreams\n- Atari (horrendous brown, red and yellowish combinations...

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",
