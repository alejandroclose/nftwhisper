Typography hand-made by @nathansonic\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nPress s to save.\nClick the screen to pause the animation.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nThis piece explores the interplay of our concepts of communication and the web.\n\nThe transaction hash creates the randomization but it’s also the protagonist in this story. It dons the stone and halo as the key for how the blockchain speaks to you.\n\nThe transaction hash is brought purposefully into the piece in order to recognize its significance almost as a deity in the generative process. It’s the one thin string binding our real-life experience with blockchain.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nIf you want a larger scene with more detail (larger resolution), zoom out using the browser zoom. Be careful as the more you zoom out the more ground elements will be created to fill the scene.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nPricing - Dutch auction\nThe pricing is a Dutch auction set at 4 - 3 - 3. 433 is the number of randomized variables in the piece.\n\nMint amount\nThe mint amount is 170. 170 is the number of unique elements multiplied by 10.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nThe binding string started with a focus on maximizing the possible variations.\n\nThis has led to the project having 433 randomizable variables that tweak the scene to create insane variation. A lot of this variation is very subtle, but it’s there.\n\nRandom variables: 433 = 281 (rand int) + 62 (rand float) + 90 (Perlin noise).\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nThe binding string has multiple layered scene elements. Some of these elements interact. Plants are forced back by the halo, elements closer to the central glowing rock reflect more light etc. There are 17 elements in total.\n\nHere are some of the elements that characterize the narrative and aesthetic:\nStone circle\nPlanets\nPlants (trees, bushes)\nFireflies\nAnimated halo\nGlyph text\nA smart, fully randomized custom palette creator.\nGeometric shapes\nAtmosphere scenarios ( day, evening, night, foggy)\nRocks\nMossy-ness\nCrystal Geodes\nSkewed hills\nGround elements (mud, grass)\nMath based lighting\nGalaxy lines\nShadow dust\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\nExtra special thanks to @nathansonic for his support, feedback, and code editions.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\n\n3rd party code used:\nVarious bits by @nathansonic, including a custom palette creator.\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n\n+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+",

            "description": "\"A mille-feuille (French pronunciation: ​[mil fœj], \"thousand-sheets\"), also known by the names Napoleon, vanilla slice, and custard slice, is a dessert made of puff pastry layered with pastry cream. Its modern form was influenced by improvements made by Marie-Antoine Carême.\n\nTraditionally, a mille-feuille is made up of three layers of puff pastry (pâte feuilletée), alternating with two layers of pastry cream (crème pâtissière). The top pastry layer is finished in various ways: sometimes it is topped with whipped cream, or it may be dusted with icing sugar, cocoa, pastry crumbs, or sliced almonds. It may also be glazed with icing or fondant alone, or in alternating white (icing) and brown (chocolate) or other colored icing stripes, and combed to create a marbled effect.\" — Wikipedia\n\nPrints available upon request: prints@stefancontiero.com\nBest enjoyed on browsers supporting Display-P3 color gamut.\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\n@stefan_contiero\n",

Link at the bottom. If you’d rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
