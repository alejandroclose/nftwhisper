            "description": "A \"feedback crystal\" is a cellular automaton (similar to Conway's Game of Life) where the rules are represented by a randomized kernel. The kernel determines the micro and macro structures that develop in the crystal. The crystals are grown from \"seed\" pixels (in this artwork, the white outline and white center pixel provide the seed).\n\nSometimes the patterns are chaotic, sometimes they are stable. If you are lucky, a pattern will be generated \"on the edge of chaos\" that mixes stability and chaos in an emergent complex system. These are rare. In addition, a small number of artworks will result in \"dead\" crystals that do not grow. These are also rare, but there is a chance that your crystal will be a mostly black square.\n\nEach piece is composed of 3 different randomly generated kernels that sweep outwards from the center.",

            "description": "\"I never wanted color to be color. I never wanted texture to be texture, or images to become shapes. I wanted them all to fuse together into a living spirit.\" - Clyfford Still\n\n\nI have spent most of my life residing in urban environments. While figurative art is not a style I typically pursue in my own work, I delight in discovering abstract elements within it. The cities I've inhabited have consistently offered me the chance to do so through their architectural landscapes.\n\nLe Corbusier once said that a metropolis's abstract skyline serves as its autobiography, etched in steel and glass, unveiling its history, character, and ambitions. In this series, my aim has been to encapsulate that sentiment using a minimalistic canvas and a monochromatic palette. Abstract expressionism remains my lens for viewing every artwork. \n\nThe style of this series is my homage to Clyfford Still, an abex artist I have always admired. His ability to convey profound meaning through seemingly empty and unfilled canvases has always intrigued me. \n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress s to save the image in full screen. \n\nPixel Love!",

This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle.

            "description": "This project uses cellular automata where the state of a cell in a new generation is determined based on its own and its neighbors' states in the previous generation. The guiding rules for these transitions, however, are not static; they undergo a random change every few generations, chosen from a possible 256 rules. By also slightly shifting the positions of cells and using an outline and texture that conveys a hand-drawn style, I have tried introducing an element of organic randomness.\n\nStepping away from the monochromatic color scheme used in my last three series, I have used a gradient effect to convey a transitioning hue across generations, combining a palette of two colors selected from an array of 14 different palettes. \n\nNote on the name: The alternating rules and fluctuating cell positions serve as the apparent justification for its name. However, a subtler inspiration lies in my deep admiration for Franz Kafka and his remarkable short story, \"The Metamorphosis\". Kafka’s narrative explores the constantly evolving state of human existence, where patterns appear momentarily only to dissipate quickly. Just when you think you've spotted a pattern, poof, it changes. Just like in life, right :)\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

            "description": "The series employs fractal circles to create repeating patterns, using a monochrome color palette on the canvas. The number, size, and density of circles as well as the level of recursion, vary across pieces. The introduction of these variations and arcs adds a new dimension to fractals by juxtaposing their self-similar nature at all scales with elements of randomness.\n\nThis is my third series in a row that features a monochromatic color palette. There's something about the limitation of using only binary colors that enables me to appreciate abstraction purely for its form.\n\nNote on the name: The series draws its name from Sayed Haider Raza of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group. I have always admired Raza’s use of sacred geometry and his abstract work has forever been a source of inspiration. Raza believed that ‘Bindu’ (the dot, point or circle) is the ultimate point of creation, representing the universe in its entirety.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

            "description": "\"I never wanted color to be color. I never wanted texture to be texture, or images to become shapes. I wanted them all to fuse together into a living spirit.\" - Clyfford Still\n\n\nI have spent most of my life residing in urban environments. While figurative art is not a style I typically pursue in my own work, I delight in discovering abstract elements within it. The cities I've inhabited have consistently offered me the chance to do so through their architectural landscapes.\n\nLe Corbusier once said that a metropolis's abstract skyline serves as its autobiography, etched in steel and glass, unveiling its history, character, and ambitions. In this series, my aim has been to encapsulate that sentiment using a minimalistic canvas and a monochromatic palette. Abstract expressionism remains my lens for viewing every artwork. \n\nThe style of this series is my homage to Clyfford Still, an abex artist I have always admired. His ability to convey profound meaning through seemingly empty and unfilled canvases has always intrigued me. \n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress s to save the image in full screen. \n\nPixel Love!",

Additional patterns are combined in the grid with these distortions to create the final artwork.\n\nPatterns for the individual blocks in the grid are divided into categories, and various amounts are picked for each work, with dozens of possible mixtures. Patterns can flow in different directions across the varied canvases. Distribution of these patterns across the grid varies from work to work, providing for different feels as they bunch together or spread apart.",

            "description": "Adjacent is the third in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art. This piece focuses on the study of Diagonal White, a series he developed between 1970 and 1975.\n\nIn 1976, Ruth Leavitt published a collection of papers titled \"Artist & Computer\", which highlighted the 35 prominent generative artists and asked them to discuss their work. They were posed questions like, \"Do you feel art work created with a computer has now or will have an impact on art as a whole in the future?\". Edward Zajec was a subject of one of those papers and in it detailed the approach to Diagonal White. \n\nThe original program was run on a CDC 6200 computer at The Univeresiry of Trieste. The programming was done in collaboration with Dr. Matjaz Hmeljak, his long-time technical partner. Inspired by his collaborative relationship, Adjacent the output of a partnership between Christine Hall and Chris Maddern.\n\nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to save a high-resolution version of the image\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nBy @christine_hall and @chrismaddern",
