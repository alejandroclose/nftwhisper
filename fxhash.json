            "description": "“Matriisi” is a generative artwork exploring the artistic, visual and conceptual possibilities of matrices in generative abstract art.\n\nIt is designed to be a digital artwork, to be viewed from a high quality monitor or tv, or printed and framed. Contemporary life is getting more and more digitalized and almost everyone has a device with a high resolution screen. With this artwork I am aiming to enable art collectors, traditional and digital, to have an artwork they can enjoy from their screen or tv, and save wall space for traditional hand made art objects.\n\nThe artwork is orientation agnostic, there is no preferred way it is supposed to be looked or hanged.\n \n\nThe artwork is based on set of number matrices used as main compositional structure. This data is then interpreted to draw the visual elements: matrices of lines and dots. As a play on digital vs handmade, lines and shapes imitating drawing highlight the forms made by the matrices. \n\nThere are 10 different colour palettes, that can be also mixed together. These colours draw inspiration from different eras and styles of art. \n\nAs the artwork is developed based on visual variety, there will are no separate features, as these would add limitations to the range of the generator.\n\n40 iterations are reserved for live minting in the gallery during the exhibition.\n\nMatriisi is shown in Luisa Catucci Gallery in Berlin between 1.9.2022 and 1.10.2022 in the generative art exhibition “Improbable Iterations” together with Joonas Toivonen aka Toiminto. He is showing his artwork “Fragment Assembler” also out on FX(Hash). Welcome to the opening of the exhibition on 1.9.2022 16-19pm @ Allerstraße 38, 12049, Berlin. Both artists will be present.\n\nControls in live view:\n-Pressing j exports the current image as jpeg\n-Pressing p exports the current image as png\n\nTo change the detail level one can access the pixel density of render by adding &pixDens=3 to the end of the URL in live view. You can of course put number other than 4 also. I it renders just a black image, you have to lower the number, since it is then too large for WEBGL to render.\n\n\nMade with p5.js\n\nAntti Pussinen, in Berlin 26.8. 2022\n",

            "description": "\"初夏の旅路 Traveling in Early Summer\"\nis part of the interactive minting experience at Proof of X with KUMALEON, Tokyo, 2023.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nConcept:\n\nAs the rainy days came to an end, the gentle fall of cherry blossoms marked the arrival of early summer. This transitional phase between spring and summer brings a mild and pleasant climate. Nature awakens, showcasing vibrant shades of green as plants thrive and flourish. A stroll through the streets of Tokyo reveals a captivating sight: hydrangeas of various colors grace every corner, casting a spell of natural beauty. While the occasional typhoon may pass by, it does not overshadow the charm of this season. Moreover, the ripening plums offer a taste of traditional Japanese flavors, with options ranging from sour plums to plum wine.\n\nMy inspiration for this piece draws upon my own impressions of early summer in Japan. In 2019, having recently arrived in Japan, I embarked on a journey to Kamakura with my friends. The vivid hydrangeas and serene ponds at Hasedera Temple left an indelible mark on my memory as my first encounter with the essence of early summer in Japan. It was during that year that I delved into the realm of creative coding, by using Processing. The following year, in 2020, I ventured further into generative art using P5.js. Both my pursuit of knowledge in Japan and my creative endeavors became integral parts of my life's journey, akin to cherished scenic spots that leave a lasting impression. Through my artwork, I aspire to share my sentiments from this transformative voyage with the audience.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nNow, let's delve into the details of my creation. The objective of this artwork was to portray a top-down perspective of a pond encircled by lush vegetation, reminiscent of a landscape painting. To imbue the work with different atmospheres, I incorporated four distinct styles for the plant elements: grass, leaves, pine needles, and bubbles. The interplay of these elements breathes life into the still scene, infusing the entire artwork with vitality. The rippling water and gracefully swimming koi in the pond evoke a sense of movement, juxtaposing the serene setting. In Eastern culture, koi symbolizes wealth, auspiciousness, health, and happiness. It bestows good fortune upon those who encounter it. Ultimately, my artwork encapsulates my initial impression of early summer in Japan through a creative approach that intertwines reality and imagination, merging motion and stillness.\n\nThrough this artistic endeavor, I aim to transport the audience to the captivating realm of early summer in Japan. With its vibrant colors, gentle breezes, and the promise of new beginnings, this season captures the essence of natural beauty and the richness of Japanese culture. May my work resonate with viewers, allowing them to embark on their own journey through the enchanting landscapes of their imagination.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nSave as a Picture:\n\nPress “s”or “S” to download a PNG copy of the artwork.\n",

            "description": "This small project is several things:\n\n1. First and foremost, it's a little, light \"visual ASMR\" treat to bring some positivity into your day - some \"Maluma\" softness to contrast the more common \"Takete\" of contemporary generative art aesthetics[1].\n\n2. A small gift to celebrate the fledgling generative art/design community on Mastodon: 20 of the 128 tokens are given to some of the people in that slowly growing community, with the remainder given as Thank You (and smoke signal/sign of life) to some of my existing collectors, randomly chosen via lottery script[2].\n\n3. For those so inclined, and with a bit of hand-holding, ChatGPT explains the _true_ conceptual depths of this project much better than I ever could:\n\n\"The bubbles in this generative art piece serve as a reflection of the human experience, reminding us of our own impermanence and the ephemeral nature of all things. The piece invites us to contemplate the fundamental questions of human existence and speaks to our innate curiosity and desire to understand the world around us.\n\nThrough the convergence of science and art, this piece reveals the infinite complexity and unpredictability of the world while also hinting at the underlying order that exists within the chaos of the universe. It reminds us that even in the midst of uncertainty, there is beauty and order to be found, and that it is through the pursuit of knowledge and understanding that we can find meaning and purpose in our lives.\"\n\nIsn't that lovely & who can argue with that?! :)\n\n4. I often revisit projects/ideas after many years, mainly to re-examine them with new eyes/knowledge/tools and/or to get answers/verification which I couldn't get earlier. This is one of these instances. So for the more rational-minded, this is a TypeScript/GLSL (WebGL) version of an older Clojure/Houdini project (from 2016) to generate a Voronoi via the simulation of intersecting sphere meshes (aka foam bubbles). In this new version the sim & deformations are done in realtime (~4M vertices, mainly via vertex shader). Also added some _basic_ physics and procedural textures to create more of a quirky character (hopefully complemented by the different color themes and other params).\n\nMade with ❤️ and https://thi.ng/umbrella!\n\n[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba/kiki_effect\n[2] https://gist.github.com/postspectacular/3d970e02570b7dfd32d03d43e1e7e3e0\n\nHotkeys:\n\nSPACE : pause/play\nX     : export current frame as PNG\n\nUltra-widescreen support:\n\nThe piece should be adaptive to aspect ratios from 1:3 (portrait) to 4:1 (landscape).",

            "description": "\"Slice of Life\" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

The fact is that, according to a few millennia of research, there are a limited number of distinct human emotions, predefined by the human psyche. Sometimes it may seem like we are experiencing a \"new\" one, but on closer inspection, we see that it is the known emotions that are superimposed. Emotions are what they are, and they exist in the same way in each of us, whether we recognize them for what they are or not. But as our history blends into a new emerging state of the world, a whole new range of emotional responses are triggered within us.

            "description": "It is estimated that over 5% of the earth's land surface is covered by lichen and some have been alive for over 5000 years. Since beginning this project we have been interested to notice lichen growing everywhere, all around us, on walls and stones, pavements and trees, usually pale and unobtrusive but sometimes gloriously colourful.\n\nThis artwork is created on 3 layers, a primary, secondary and interactive layer.\nTo interact first use a key:\n'v' for vertical;\n'h' for horizontal;\n'r' for round;\n'l' for loose;\nthen click on the canvas and a patch of lichen will be drawn in the chosen style.\n\nClicking 'n' will create a new blank canvas to draw on.\n\nClicking 'y' will return to the original layers but you will need to reload in order to draw on this layer.\n\nClicking 'u' will delete the interactive layer and clicking again will delete the secondary layer.\n\nTo redraw it will be necessary to reload the artwork but clicking 'o' before drawing will allow you to draw on a new layer over the top of the existing work.\n\nKeys 4, 5, 6 & 7 will render at larger sizes.\n\nMost palettes are subtle and/or natural but there are 3 increasingly rare palettes, Rainbow, Monochrome and Golden.\nOriginal artworks which include overlapping are also rare.",
