            "description": "Quartzamata thinks outside the box; yet it is framed inside a box. Looking with fresh eyes, it explores how the visualization of 1D Cellular Automata can be elevated to higher dimensions and heights. \n\nIn my previously published generative artworks utilizing CAs, I had explored novel ways of coloring them (in AutomataLands); used them to texturize and colorize other generative works (in AutomataPunks); and had planted mixed species of such lacy colorful CAs on curved 3D surfaces (in Cellulaire).\n\nIn Quartzamata, I turn CA visualizations into high dimensional objects and sculptures. A Quartzamata's cells are not mere flat squares on a 2D grid, colored with 2, 4, or even 8 colors. Instead, each cell is a complex, decorated, and colorful 3D object. What creates a Quartzamata's global 3D form and structure is the bending and twisting, and carving and shaping, of the cells and their 2D grid in a multitude of ways. And while some Quartzamata are static and lifeless, others are dynamic and alive organisms.\n\nThe novel concept of decorating CA cells, that I am introducing in Quartzamata, adds an extra layer of visual beauty and complexity to CA patterns; it turns them into objects and structures with intricate repeating patterns of colorful shapes and symbols, reminiscent of many types of human-made artifacts, such as wallpapers, tapestries, rugs, textiles, mosaics, embroidery, beadwork, and lace.\n\nQuartzamata twists and turns, and just like a key it unlocks the box that contains its predecessors; exotic species of CA that not only exhibited richer and more complex patterns, but also were the first to stealthily acquire the gene for decorated cells. And that's another twist and turn; this one in the lineage of Quartzamata itself.\n\nGrab a key, spot the puns, and have some fun!\n\nControls:\nUse 'h' to turn the interactive mode off/on, and to save energy.\nWhen in interactive mode use: \n\t'b' : to hide/reveal the box framing the Quartzamata. \n\t'n' : to remove/add the noisy texture/aura around the Quartzamata.\n\t'c' : to add/remove background color. \n\t'l' (small L) : to turn lights on/off. The mouse controls the location of the light source. \n\tleft/right arrows : to set the Quartzamata into rotating left/right. \n\tup/down arrows : to speed up/down the rotation. \n\t'p' : to pause the rotation.\n\t'f' : to toggle on/off the full-screen mode. Note that resizing the screen resets the scene.\n\t's' : to save a screenshot as a PNG file.

Turning off the noise and lights help speed up navigation. The more complex a Quartzamata, the heavier and thus harder it is to move around.\n\nLicense:\nSee included LICENSE.md\n\nCredits:\nMade in p5js and WebGL.\n\nArtist: Vida V.",

            "description": "Take your entire life, full as it is with the vastness of your lived experiences – and shape it into your cupped hands. Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",

Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water.

You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab.

Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science.

Looking with fresh eyes, it explores how the visualization of 1D Cellular Automata can be elevated to higher dimensions and heights. \n\nIn my previously published generative artworks utilizing CAs, I had explored novel ways of coloring them (in AutomataLands); used them to texturize and colorize other generative works (in AutomataPunks); and had planted mixed species of such lacy colorful CAs on curved 3D surfaces (in Cellulaire).\n\nIn Quartzamata, I turn CA visualizations into high dimensional objects and sculptures. A Quartzamata's cells are not mere flat squares on a 2D grid, colored with 2, 4, or even 8 colors. Instead, each cell is a complex, decorated, and colorful 3D object. What creates a Quartzamata's global 3D form and structure is the bending and twisting, and carving and shaping, of the cells and their 2D grid in a multitude of ways. And while some Quartzamata are static and lifeless, others are dynamic and alive organisms.\n\nThe novel concept of decorating CA cells, that I am introducing in Quartzamata, adds an extra layer of visual beauty and complexity to CA patterns; it turns them into objects and structures with intricate repeating patterns of colorful shapes and symbols, reminiscent of many types of human-made artifacts, such as wallpapers, tapestries, rugs, textiles, mosaics, embroidery, beadwork, and lace.\n\nQuartzamata twists and turns, and just like a key it unlocks the box that contains its predecessors; exotic species of CA that not only exhibited richer and more complex patterns, but also were the first to stealthily acquire the gene for decorated cells. And that's another twist and turn; this one in the lineage of Quartzamata itself.\n\nGrab a key, spot the puns, and have some fun!\n\nControls:\nUse 'h' to turn the interactive mode off/on, and to save energy.\nWhen in interactive mode use: \n\t'b' : to hide/reveal the box framing the Quartzamata. \n\t'n' : to remove/add the noisy texture/aura around the Quartzamata.\n\t'c' : to add/remove background color. \n\t'l' (small L) : to turn lights on/off.

            "description": "Henge is an exploration of circular megalithic structures of the prehistoric age. It is a work of historical fiction where these stone assemblies, achieved through herculean efforts of stacking, aligning, and balancing immense chiseled rocks, are reimagined within an alternate universe of algorithmic possibility. Historically, henges share a few qualities that inspired this project. First, they are places of gathering within a loose collection of stones to organize ceremony or worship under celestial alignments. They are also monolithic in their materiality and employ the most elemental techniques of megalithic, or large stone, construction. These particular types of henges, known as cromlechs, are circular spaces fit with purpose and ritual and in this sense, serve as precedents to the great human edifices; charging landscapes with meaning and presence through geometry and order. Finally, henges are a collective language of place-making shared across a range of cultures and ages, from the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras and across territories from modern-day Morocco, Portugal, Brazil, Germany, Scandinavia, to the well-known Stonehenge in Great Britain.\n\nThis project is deeply inspired by the timeless and universal narrative created through the thoughtful and deliberate placement of large rocks in a circle. It seems that when confronted with marking a place and communing with nature, human beings like to make circles out of stones. Among all the symbols of place making, the circle is the original and still remains the most universal. Through the use of code to portray these imperfect structures, Henge animates the history of these circles in all their roughness and seemingly endless variation.\n\n\n--------\n\nCreated by Aranda\\Lasch @ArandaLasch\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\nNovember 2022\n\n[Interaction instructions]\n'left' + 'right' arrow keys to change view\n'i' saves a 2048x2048 PNG\n\n[Info]\np5.js\nHenge is optimized for Chrome, runs slowly on Firefox (the longer the wait, the more stones and/or grass are being generated)\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n10% of all primary and secondary proceeds donated directly to Girls Who Code\n",

            "description": "\"I used to live in a small city placed at the center of Iran's plateau with the warmest summer days in the country part; spending most of my childhood with my sweet grandma at her old house. She was always keeping her eyes on me not to get heat stroke at noon playing in the yard when the sun was at its peak glowing furiously. Sundays at noon were my favorite, I used to call them “Ice cream” noons sitting beside the nicest person you could imagine and enjoying a delightful ice cream. You won't know how lovely it was to have an ice cream relaxing under the most enjoyable cold breeze of the tallest windcatcher in the city at her house. \"\n\n\n\nThe Badgirs city is the first collaboration between Fleep and IceRain on Fxhash. The concept was established first with the design of a school with a feeling of safe and nostalgia reminding us of the good memories of our childhood as the grandma’s house and the windcatcher for Fleep.\nA windcatcher (Badgir) is an Iranian traditional architectural element in the form of a small tower built on the roof of houses in warm locations to create passive cooling. The collection of Badgirs city is a modern recreational development of those traditional windcatchers designed by Fleep and icerain and exquisitely translated into code by Icerain.\n\nControls:\n[1] Set the resolution to Medium Resolution\n[2] Set the resolution to High Resolution",

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

Auction will stop changing price when non-reserves are fully minted.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nNature’s wild flourish and untamed growth wondrously represent the exacting function of beauty — a function that is at once useful and infinitely creative. Perhaps nowhere is this delicate symbiosis better observed than in the flower, wherein a pure balance of physical fundamentals exists beneath ornate patterns and elaborate aesthetics.\n\nAmongst the layers of undulating, vividly colored petals, attention-grabbing stigma and stamen, and lusciously decorative features, nature’s organic abundance and disorder disguises its masterful propensity for precision. Each of the flower’s components evolve through unpredictable interactions with an unwieldy natural environment, creating spectacular adaptations that emerge from the tension between what attracts.\n\nRococo painters appreciated the organic fluidity found in flowers and vegetal forms, using their joyful abundance to depict a break from the rigid and stoic period the artists hoped to leave behind. They sought to reframe perfection away from predictability and toward compositions as surprising as the natural world around them.\n\nThus, ‘Rococo’ is a generative distortion of an old tradition: a digital painting created entirely with code that interprets and processes the natural world’s dichotomies. This painting algorithm builds upon natural structures while melding and moving their colors beyond form, growing randomly organic iterations that are as perfect as they are imperfect.\n\nCreated by Ori Ben-Shabat & Ronen Tanchum @Phenomenalabs\nCreative contributions from Tender @tender_art\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTechnical Details:\n\n- Mobile/GPU Intensive\n- Press “s” to save a .png of the artwork in live view\n- Press “p” to render a high res output + press “s” to save a printable .png",

Gardens have always been small pieces of paradise for me, and hearing the word in Armenian triggers a flood of warm memories.\n\nMemories of wandering around my grandfather’s garden, plucking ripe plums and figs from their branches.\nMemories of playing in my parents yard, the scent of jasmine in the summer heat.\nOf sun warmed tomatoes in my mom’s vegetable patch.\nThe smell of dirt and grass.\nMud on my hands.\nSun on my skin.\nMemories of paradise.\n\nI hope you enjoy these gardens I’ve planted, and I hope they remind you of some warm and wonderful memories.\n \nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n - This piece uses a shader to compute the lighting of the terrain in the first frame. If you don’t have a graphics card, you may have difficulty running this.\n\n - Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you the progress of the render, and also show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.\n\n - Finally, collectors at the highest tier will be entitled to a signed print of their edition. For further details and updates, keep an eye on my Twitter (@_NatSarkissian).\n",
