            "description": "\"Rangxel\" is part of the live outdoor art installation - 'Computational Convergence' at India Art Fair, held from 9-12 February 2023 in New Delhi. \n\nRangxel is an interpretation of traditional Rangoli formations as tesseracts, combined to form monolithic structures. \n\nRangoli is a traditional artform that originated in India and is typically created during rituals and festivals like Diwali. It involves drawing intricate designs, typically on the floor, using materials such as colored powders, flowers, and grains. \n\nRangoli is meant to bring prosperity and happiness to a home and can range from simple geometric patterns to more complex depictions of nature.\n\nThe Rangxel tesseracts are created through rule-based instructions, following traditional Rangoli formation principles like symmetry, repeating patterns, and themes, resulting in interconnected, multi-dimensional forms of fragments.\n\nThese monolithic structures also reflect natural 3D grids found in nature such as crystals and honeycombs,presenting a deconstructed, pixelated matrix of our universe. \n\nUltimately, the reality we live in is an abstraction of the algorithm narrated by the creator.\n\n#StayPixelated\n\nControls (){\nDouble click Once to Enable Rotate around Tesseract;\nDouble click Twice to Disable  Rotate;\nDouble click Thrice to Go back original Composition;\nRotate , Zoom , Pan with Touch/Mouse;\n}\n",

            "description": "Mecha-Bamboo is the second installment in the Mecha series, where I attempt to blend mechanical elements with nature.\n\nThe main building blocks used in this piece are metal pipes, nuts and bolts forming bamboo stems and mending plates extending outwards with sharp metal scraps at their ends resembling branches and leaves. \n\nThere are 4 main arrangement variations \n\t- Two abstract variations with the metal bamboos growing out of the sides and border (20% chance each)\n\t- Two landscape arrangements, one on flat planes and the other on floating platforms.  (30% chance each)\n\nThe dominant stroke and fill colors are chosen at random from the RGB color space and are only recomputed if certain contrast criteria aren't fulfilled. \nIn combination with one of 10 hand-selected color palettes used for accents, this allows a great variation of different possible color schemes.\n\nThe structure and appearance of the bamboo, its stems and leaves are controlled by over 50 parameters that are chosen at random, giving each iteration a unique style.\n\n\n\nKeys: \nS - Save PNG image\nV - Open SVG Export menu\nSpace - Pause\n\nPlotting:\nYou can export a plottable SVG of each iteration by opening the export menu. I plot these on A3 with a 0.1mm fineliner. But depending on the density of the iteration other choices might be better suited. \n\n\nThe image is generated entirely in Javascript and the postprocessing is done with a custom shader. If there is no webgl support, the image will render without any postprocessing. You can force this by appending the URL parameter \"?noWebgl=1\".\n\nLibraries used:\nThree.js & EffectComposer\nJavascript-Voronoi by gorhill\nperlin.js by  Joseph Gentle\ndat.gui",

            "description": "The existing nature grows on the unexisting spirits.\n\nGenerative sketch, based on the pen and ink drawings of Po Sheng Chen. Po Sheng Chen is an Architect who has drawn nothing but Architecture for over 25 years. He tried to explore something different from his previous style (Brutalism with Magical Realism), so developed his own Minimalist Architecture process and style. After breaking up all the complicated elements and symbols, he chose a simple and naive way to present “pure volumes in the space (the essential of Architecture)”: the Use of different densities of vertical lines to create different faces of volumes, with the addition of horizontal lines to create shadows on the volumes. Shadow determined the form of volumes, then they became a clear composition in the space, Eliminating chaos. These lines seem like spirits to Po Sheng Chen, because they represent the soul of Architecture, but they do not have a specific form or meaning...they are between existing and unexisting! Tezumie is a creative generative artist. He saw the latest experimental drawings of Po Sheng Chen, and after reaching out, the collab was formed with the goal of creating a digital representation of the original concept surrounded by a natural and overgrown environment. The combination of nature and architecture.\n\nMade in p5js.\n",

You can scale up using 1,2,3 and 4 of you keyboard to increase the quality of resolution (it may create some variations on the art itself, and it should be done before clicking on canvas)\n\nThe preview is only a sketch of the artwork, since the livecoding functions vary depending on the interaction.\n\nThis project was designed in Hydra.js for Desktop computers on Chrome.\n\nSince it is a livecoding library there may be small differences in each code execution, but the deterministic character remains.\n\nThe machine waits for your command to start drawing - there is no plan or goal, sometimes the values assigned to the variables would lead to the construction of a visually recognizable work, but the fact that these values are randomized 4 times during the duration of the interaction breaks the logical line of visual conduction.\n\nI can only appeal to Gestalt, and beg you to make the effort to see the whole divided between 4 apparently disconnected patterns. This is not just a code that generates noises, I am here making a testament to push once again the limit of abstraction, to perhaps convince you that there is immense beauty in discontinuity.\n\nAnd it is worth commenting once again that without your click/command, the machine will be eternally lodged in the server waiting - and not knowing what it is waiting for. And this waiting is the most beautiful thing in the world, because the art is already determined to happen, its strokes and patterns were defined when the hash was tied to the code, the art was already made and already exists in the moment preceding this one - but for a computer time does not exist.\n\nThe Unrealized Painting has come to remind you that we, the ones with souls and who feel time, control the realizable and the unrealizable - and it will never stop being that way.",
