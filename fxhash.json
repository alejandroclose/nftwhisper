            "description": "Mudaashiku (「無駄足区」- “Fool’s Errand District”) invokes the place where you first really experienced what it means to be a person in a city. Were you awestruck? Did you feel lost or disoriented by a realization of the size of the spaces around you? Perhaps you sought some detail, some small thing to focus on to reorient yourself and feel like a person again in the face of such immensity and confusion.\n\nThis work is inspired by an attempt to capture some of the feeling I had when I first moved to Tokyo and was utterly overwhelmed. It was both exciting and frightening to suddenly be lost in a place so immense and unfamiliar. If Stendhal Syndrome refers to the fearful ecstasy of experiencing the beauties of Florence, then there must be something similar for the first experience of a great city. This work attempts only to point in the direction of such a feeling.\n\nTake a moment to experience the district as a whole, but then, with a change of perception, your focus may shift to the individual building or group of buildings. And then, back again. This duality of scales has been integral to the development of the work.\n\nThe work expresses eight features:\nAspect ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.41, 1.41:1, 1.2:1\nEnvironment: Central (most common), north river, east river, south causeway, west causeway (most rare).\nPalette: Thirty seven selected palettes. Chosen either for their aesthetic qualities, or as an attempted expression of some element of urban life.\nDivisions: 15, 18, or 21.\nColor variance: 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36, 0.54.\nSun direction: East or west.\nLocale: Either central or commuter town. Determines the height profile of the district.\nRoads: Represented, or not.\n\nThe work begins by gradually revealing the layout of the district. This process can take from about 6 seconds to as much as 2 minutes, but 50 to 60 seconds is typical. When this process is complete, the colors and facades will be added and the work revealed.\n\nOnce the work is complete, it can be adjusted using the following controls:\n\n[0] Fit size to window (default)\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels\n[4] Set shortest edge to 8000 pixels (please be patient!)\n\nAfter changing the dimensions, the work may appear the same size in your browser. The new dimensions will be apparent when you save an image.\n\n[s] Save work at current dimensions\n[b] Add or remove border\n[g] Add or remove background grain\n\nMade in 100% vanilla javascript.\nOpenSimplexNoise.js used for noise.\n",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "Power Ranges is an artistic endeavor born not from a concept, but from the pure spirit of experimentation. While I could attempt to uncover a profound narrative or significance behind this project, the truth of the matter is that Power Ranges is, in essence, just a form of digital doodling with code. A testament to the beauty of unbridled exploration in the realm of art, where discovery and wonder sometimes take precedence over any predetermined purpose.\n\nIn this project, I have harnessed the power of height maps and ranges to create an intriguing visual experience. The origin was the implementation of the marching squares algorithm that I had never used before. From there I started to play with height maps, mixing noise and custom shapes. Finally, I wrote a parser for the map in order to generate the isolines that are then drawn using my beloved Superline script.\n\nI hope you’ll like the outputs as much as I did while testing the algorithm. Some of them can be truly cute.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ”s” to save the current output.\n\nPressing the keys “1”, “2” or “3” the artwork will regenerate at a different scale.\n\nThe “size” parameter can also be passed via URL with the values “s”, “m” or “l” to initialize the generator with the desired size.\n\n=======================================\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\nPowered by p5 and chroma.\n",

            "description": "Returns is an offline-first PWA and an interactive SVG. It combines the joy of interaction, digital color and minimalist sculpture with the potential of a long running, continuously unique visual. Based on “Shipping” from 2016, it is inspired by Anne Truitt, Ugo Rondinone, Imi Knoebel, Kelly Ellsworth and many others.\n\nA subdivision slices the viewport influenced by width, height and depth. Corners are cut by replacing them with two new points, pulled towards each other along the edges. Shapes are “rounded\" by repeating this step, keeping the new points close together. As colors change, so do the relations between shapes, even if geometry changes at a slower pace. New compositions are created on click or after a timeout. This progress over time allows for infinite iterations within the space of each token. It is the promise of a seeded starting point, plus the potential for unlimited new and unique iterations and states over time.",

            "description": "“And in the bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes boiled in from the edge of space, hypnagogic images jerking past like a film compiled of random frames.”\nWilliam Gibson, “Neuromancer”, 1984\n\n\nrtrdgtzr (/ˈɹɛ.tɹoʊ ˈdɪdʒɪtaɪzə(ɹ)/, pronounced same as retro digitizer) is a long-form collaborative collection celebrating pixel and glitch art, graphics from the '80s and '90s, and techno-dystopian aesthetics of William Gibson's novels. What you see when you open the minting interface is an editor which takes an input image provided by the minter, applies generative post-processing to it, and finally outputs an animated composition. The input image itself is compressed and stored on-chain through params mechanic as a signal in string format, retrieved every time the artwork is regenerated. Minters are in fact authors of minted tokens, implicit collaborators, who are appropriately entitled to half the royalties. To facilitate co-creation, minting process provides an intuitive interface as well as WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) for full control of the output. Effect stacks in rtrdgtzr were originally developed for the ǥᵍłˡŧᵗȼᶜħʰvᵛɍʳsˢ collection released on GlitchForge in 2023 and feature customized diffusion dithering and aberrated pixel sorting. In terms of narrative and aesthetics, these two collections form an artistic continuum.\n\nMinting interface is designed to guide the minter through the whole process in a user-friendly way. Quick visual guide as well as technical aspects of the collection are described in detail in the accompanying fx(text) article “rtrdgtzr – Minter’s Guide”. Please read it before proceeding with the mint. For more info on the curation process, please follow us on social media. If you want to contribute as an artist, reach out!\n\nThe collaborative minting process was greatly inspired by “Universal Rayhatcher” from Piter Pasma and “Pensado a mano” collections from Alejandro Campos, both innovative at the time in their use of params mechanics. As we see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in, rtrdgtzr is also an official entry to the fxhackathon 2023: co-creation interfaces. We hope its openness and experimental character will serve as inspiration to others. But primarily, we hope it will inspire artists who don’t work with code to contribute to it.\n\n\nKey controls:\ng: export gif animation (current output scale)\ns: export png image (current output scale)\nleft + right arrow: change output scale (1x-10x)\nb: toggle page background color\np: pause / run animation\n\nNOTE: Minting should be done from a desktop device as the interface does not support mobile browsers (unless you find a way to drag-and-drop the image onto the canvas, in which case you’re good to go).\n\nCreated with p5.js in 2023 by {protocell:labs}.",

            "description": "“And in the bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes boiled in from the edge of space, hypnagogic images jerking past like a film compiled of random frames.”\nWilliam Gibson, “Neuromancer”, 1984\n\n\nrtrdgtzr (/ˈɹɛ.tɹoʊ ˈdɪdʒɪtaɪzə(ɹ)/, pronounced same as retro digitizer) is a long-form collaborative collection celebrating pixel and glitch art, graphics from the '80s and '90s, and techno-dystopian aesthetics of William Gibson's novels. What you see when you open the minting interface is an editor which takes an input image provided by the minter, applies generative post-processing to it, and finally outputs an animated composition. The input image itself is compressed and stored on-chain through params mechanic as a signal in string format, retrieved every time the artwork is regenerated. Minters are in fact authors of minted tokens, implicit collaborators, who are appropriately entitled to half the royalties. To facilitate co-creation, minting process provides an intuitive interface as well as WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) for full control of the output. Effect stacks in rtrdgtzr were originally developed for the ǥᵍłˡŧᵗȼᶜħʰvᵛɍʳsˢ collection released on GlitchForge in 2023 and feature customized diffusion dithering and aberrated pixel sorting. In terms of narrative and aesthetics, these two collections form an artistic continuum.\n\nMinting interface is designed to guide the minter through the whole process in a user-friendly way. Quick visual guide as well as technical aspects of the collection are described in detail in the accompanying fx(text) article “rtrdgtzr – Minter’s Guide”. Please read it before proceeding with the mint. For more info on the curation process, please follow us on social media. If you want to contribute as an artist, reach out!\n\nThe collaborative minting process was greatly inspired by “Universal Rayhatcher” from Piter Pasma and “Pensado a mano” collections from Alejandro Campos, both innovative at the time in their use of params mechanics. As we see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in, rtrdgtzr is also an official entry to the fxhackathon 2023: co-creation interfaces. We hope its openness and experimental character will serve as inspiration to others. But primarily, we hope it will inspire artists who don’t work with code to contribute to it.\n\n\nKey controls:\ng: export gif animation (current output scale)\ns: export png image (current output scale)\nleft + right arrow: change output scale (1x-10x)\nb: toggle page background color\np: pause / run animation\n\nNOTE: Minting should be done from a desktop device as the interface does not support mobile browsers (unless you find a way to drag-and-drop the image onto the canvas, in which case you’re good to go).\n\nCreated with p5.js in 2023 by {protocell:labs}.",

This artwork changes to an expressionist version once the overshoot moment has passed, day by day.\n\nThis project closes the feedback loop between lifestyle and environmental impact. 10 countries are featured with their individual overshoot moment. In Australia, the resources are completely consumed at 5 am in the morning. In Thailand, the earth’s ecological limits are reached at about 4 pm. \n\nThe data is based on the Earth Overshoot Day which is hosted and calculated by Global Footprint Network, an international research organization.

            "description": "“And in the bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes boiled in from the edge of space, hypnagogic images jerking past like a film compiled of random frames.”\nWilliam Gibson, “Neuromancer”, 1984\n\n\nrtrdgtzr (/ˈɹɛ.tɹoʊ ˈdɪdʒɪtaɪzə(ɹ)/, pronounced same as retro digitizer) is a long-form collaborative collection celebrating pixel and glitch art, graphics from the '80s and '90s, and techno-dystopian aesthetics of William Gibson's novels. What you see when you open the minting interface is an editor which takes an input image provided by the minter, applies generative post-processing to it, and finally outputs an animated composition. The input image itself is compressed and stored on-chain through params mechanic as a signal in string format, retrieved every time the artwork is regenerated. Minters are in fact authors of minted tokens, implicit collaborators, who are appropriately entitled to half the royalties. To facilitate co-creation, minting process provides an intuitive interface as well as WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) for full control of the output. Effect stacks in rtrdgtzr were originally developed for the ǥᵍłˡŧᵗȼᶜħʰvᵛɍʳsˢ collection released on GlitchForge in 2023 and feature customized diffusion dithering and aberrated pixel sorting. In terms of narrative and aesthetics, these two collections form an artistic continuum.\n\nMinting interface is designed to guide the minter through the whole process in a user-friendly way. Quick visual guide as well as technical aspects of the collection are described in detail in the accompanying fx(text) article “rtrdgtzr – Minter’s Guide”. Please read it before proceeding with the mint. For more info on the curation process, please follow us on social media. If you want to contribute as an artist, reach out!\n\nThe collaborative minting process was greatly inspired by “Universal Rayhatcher” from Piter Pasma and “Pensado a mano” collections from Alejandro Campos, both innovative at the time in their use of params mechanics. As we see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in, rtrdgtzr is also an official entry to the fxhackathon 2023: co-creation interfaces. We hope its openness and experimental character will serve as inspiration to others. But primarily, we hope it will inspire artists who don’t work with code to contribute to it.\n\n\nKey controls:\ng: export gif animation (current output scale)\ns: export png image (current output scale)\nleft + right arrow: change output scale (1x-10x)\nb: toggle page background color\np: pause / run animation\n\nNOTE: Minting should be done from a desktop device as the interface does not support mobile browsers (unless you find a way to drag-and-drop the image onto the canvas, in which case you’re good to go).\n\nCreated with p5.js in 2023 by {protocell:labs}.",

            "description": "“And in the bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes boiled in from the edge of space, hypnagogic images jerking past like a film compiled of random frames.”\nWilliam Gibson, “Neuromancer”, 1984\n\n\nrtrdgtzr (/ˈɹɛ.tɹoʊ ˈdɪdʒɪtaɪzə(ɹ)/, pronounced same as retro digitizer) is a long-form collaborative collection celebrating pixel and glitch art, graphics from the '80s and '90s, and techno-dystopian aesthetics of William Gibson's novels. What you see when you open the minting interface is an editor which takes an input image provided by the minter, applies generative post-processing to it, and finally outputs an animated composition. The input image itself is compressed and stored on-chain through params mechanic as a signal in string format, retrieved every time the artwork is regenerated. Minters are in fact authors of minted tokens, implicit collaborators, who are appropriately entitled to half the royalties. To facilitate co-creation, minting process provides an intuitive interface as well as WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) for full control of the output. Effect stacks in rtrdgtzr were originally developed for the ǥᵍłˡŧᵗȼᶜħʰvᵛɍʳsˢ collection released on GlitchForge in 2023 and feature customized diffusion dithering and aberrated pixel sorting. In terms of narrative and aesthetics, these two collections form an artistic continuum.\n\nMinting interface is designed to guide the minter through the whole process in a user-friendly way. Quick visual guide as well as technical aspects of the collection are described in detail in the accompanying fx(text) article “rtrdgtzr – Minter’s Guide”. Please read it before proceeding with the mint. For more info on the curation process, please follow us on social media. If you want to contribute as an artist, reach out!\n\nThe collaborative minting process was greatly inspired by “Universal Rayhatcher” from Piter Pasma and “Pensado a mano” collections from Alejandro Campos, both innovative at the time in their use of params mechanics. As we see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in, rtrdgtzr is also an official entry to the fxhackathon 2023: co-creation interfaces. We hope its openness and experimental character will serve as inspiration to others. But primarily, we hope it will inspire artists who don’t work with code to contribute to it.\n\n\nKey controls:\ng: export gif animation (current output scale)\ns: export png image (current output scale)\nleft + right arrow: change output scale (1x-10x)\nb: toggle page background color\np: pause / run animation\n\nNOTE: Minting should be done from a desktop device as the interface does not support mobile browsers (unless you find a way to drag-and-drop the image onto the canvas, in which case you’re good to go).\n\nCreated with p5.js in 2023 by {protocell:labs}.",

The unnatural drawing order and chromatic differences of the individual faces sometimes yields illusory or paradoxical visual geometries.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png. Press ’4’ to export a high resolution png. Press ’8’ to export a very high resolution png. Press ’e’ to export an SVG file (may take some time and produce large files).\n\nAspect ratio variations are 4:5, 5:4, 2:3, 3:2 and 1:1.\n\nBuilt in Javascript with p5.js, p5.svg and csg.js.",
