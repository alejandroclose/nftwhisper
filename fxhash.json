            "description": "Études(Reissued) is a patched and upgraded version of Études(Project #10993).\n\nÉtudes was originally published on April 16, 2022. Because of technical issues (audio doesn’t play due to external link usage) we prepared this reissue to its current holders.\n\nYou can visit the original project with this link - https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/10993 \n\n\nThis reissue comprises of some fixes and additional new features as mentioned below;\n\nNew Features;\n\n- New ‘colored’ mode; now has colored noteheads and stems. Added new sampler for the colored mode: Marimba.\n- Added a new synth for ‘inverted & colored’ mode; DuoSynth.\n\nFixes;\n\n- Fixed canvas size to prevent additional notes being added in live mode. Now it’s consistent.\n- Samples are now in the zip rather than in an external link, and won't break in the future.\n- More consistent (but still sometimes buggy) sonification and audio playback.\n- Fixed some minor issues and re-adjusted some probabilities.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Click to start the sound -\n\n‘Études’ is a series of generative notation accompanied with sound.\n\n‘Études’ is the first series of the ‘Notations’ collection. ‘Notations’ will explore various notation techniques around the world and will use different sonification techniques and generative music algorithms.\n\nIn this series, a sonification process has been used to generate sound.\n\nSome articulations or accidentals intentionally exist due to aesthetic preferences. For example there are some musically meaningless things like vibrato on a piano or a coda sign on a motif. And some notes will play the same pitch (even if they appear apart from one another) depending on the chosen scale.\n\nSonification tends to work better after 2nd (or even 3rd) play. Some minor audio bugs might occur.\n\nThere is a major but a rare bug which we intentionally kept in; it plays a generative piece from indicated pitches rather than just playing the motif only once.\n\nThere is a rare possibility that ‘Études’ can generate an ‘electronic’ result which plays with a FM synth instead of piano. \n\nProbabilities;\n\n- 12 root notes\n\n- 12 different scales\n\n- Dynamics; pp,p,mp,mf,f,ff or none\n\n- Dynamic changes; crescendo and diminuendo or none\n\n- 4 different noteheads\n\n- Several accidentals and articulations\n\n- Vibrato might occur on some outputs\n\n- 3 font styles\n\n- 4 background textures\n\n\nMade with p5.js\nIlgın İçözü, March 2022(Reissued-September 2022)\n@distcollective",

Added new sampler for the colored mode: Marimba.\n- Added a new synth for ‘inverted & colored’ mode; DuoSynth.\n\nFixes;\n\n- Fixed canvas size to prevent additional notes being added in live mode. Now it’s consistent.\n- Samples are now in the zip rather than in an external link, and won't break in the future.\n- More consistent (but still sometimes buggy) sonification and audio playback.\n- Fixed some minor issues and re-adjusted some probabilities.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Click to start the sound -\n\n‘Études’ is a series of generative notation accompanied with sound.\n\n‘Études’ is the first series of the ‘Notations’ collection. ‘Notations’ will explore various notation techniques around the world and will use different sonification techniques and generative music algorithms.\n\nIn this series, a sonification process has been used to generate sound.\n\nSome articulations or accidentals intentionally exist due to aesthetic preferences. For example there are some musically meaningless things like vibrato on a piano or a coda sign on a motif. And some notes will play the same pitch (even if they appear apart from one another) depending on the chosen scale.\n\nSonification tends to work better after 2nd (or even 3rd) play. Some minor audio bugs might occur.\n\nThere is a major but a rare bug which we intentionally kept in; it plays a generative piece from indicated pitches rather than just playing the motif only once.\n\nThere is a rare possibility that ‘Études’ can generate an ‘electronic’ result which plays with a FM synth instead of piano. \n\nProbabilities;\n\n- 12 root notes\n\n- 12 different scales\n\n- Dynamics; pp,p,mp,mf,f,ff or none\n\n- Dynamic changes; crescendo and diminuendo or none\n\n- 4 different noteheads\n\n- Several accidentals and articulations\n\n- Vibrato might occur on some outputs\n\n- 3 font styles\n\n- 4 background textures\n\n\nMade with p5.js\nIlgın İçözü, March 2022(Reissued-September 2022)\n@distcollective",

            "description": "Études(Reissued) is a patched and upgraded version of Études(Project #10993).\n\nÉtudes was originally published on April 16, 2022. Because of technical issues (audio doesn’t play due to external link usage) we prepared this reissue to its current holders.\n\nYou can visit the original project with this link - https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/10993 \n\n\nThis reissue comprises of some fixes and additional new features as mentioned below;\n\nNew Features;\n\n- New ‘colored’ mode; now has colored noteheads and stems. Added new sampler for the colored mode: Marimba.\n- Added a new synth for ‘inverted & colored’ mode; DuoSynth.\n\nFixes;\n\n- Fixed canvas size to prevent additional notes being added in live mode. Now it’s consistent.\n- Samples are now in the zip rather than in an external link, and won't break in the future.\n- More consistent (but still sometimes buggy) sonification and audio playback.\n- Fixed some minor issues and re-adjusted some probabilities.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Click to start the sound -\n\n‘Études’ is a series of generative notation accompanied with sound.\n\n‘Études’ is the first series of the ‘Notations’ collection. ‘Notations’ will explore various notation techniques around the world and will use different sonification techniques and generative music algorithms.\n\nIn this series, a sonification process has been used to generate sound.\n\nSome articulations or accidentals intentionally exist due to aesthetic preferences. For example there are some musically meaningless things like vibrato on a piano or a coda sign on a motif. And some notes will play the same pitch (even if they appear apart from one another) depending on the chosen scale.\n\nSonification tends to work better after 2nd (or even 3rd) play. Some minor audio bugs might occur.\n\nThere is a major but a rare bug which we intentionally kept in; it plays a generative piece from indicated pitches rather than just playing the motif only once.\n\nThere is a rare possibility that ‘Études’ can generate an ‘electronic’ result which plays with a FM synth instead of piano. \n\nProbabilities;\n\n- 12 root notes\n\n- 12 different scales\n\n- Dynamics; pp,p,mp,mf,f,ff or none\n\n- Dynamic changes; crescendo and diminuendo or none\n\n- 4 different noteheads\n\n- Several accidentals and articulations\n\n- Vibrato might occur on some outputs\n\n- 3 font styles\n\n- 4 background textures\n\n\nMade with p5.js\nIlgın İçözü, March 2022(Reissued-September 2022)\n@distcollective",

Your experience with the painting requires trust; trust that something will appear from the chaos of the empty space, trust that the composition you imagine halfway through will evolve along with your ideas, and trust that the etchings lend a helping hand to the message of the piece. You may find yourself pulled left and right when decisions are made, and your interpretation at 25%, 50%, and 90% will all differ. This is what makes creating so fulfilling to me, a work of art can change course wildly from start to finish, ever molding itself until it enters the kiln.\n\nPress ‘1’, ‘2’, or  ‘3’ to increase resolution (default is 1, higher than default may not work on certain browsers.

            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

            "description": "Études(Reissued) is a patched and upgraded version of Études(Project #10993).\n\nÉtudes was originally published on April 16, 2022. Because of technical issues (audio doesn’t play due to external link usage) we prepared this reissue to its current holders.\n\nYou can visit the original project with this link - https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/10993 \n\n\nThis reissue comprises of some fixes and additional new features as mentioned below;\n\nNew Features;\n\n- New ‘colored’ mode; now has colored noteheads and stems. Added new sampler for the colored mode: Marimba.\n- Added a new synth for ‘inverted & colored’ mode; DuoSynth.\n\nFixes;\n\n- Fixed canvas size to prevent additional notes being added in live mode. Now it’s consistent.\n- Samples are now in the zip rather than in an external link, and won't break in the future.\n- More consistent (but still sometimes buggy) sonification and audio playback.\n- Fixed some minor issues and re-adjusted some probabilities.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n- Click to start the sound -\n\n‘Études’ is a series of generative notation accompanied with sound.\n\n‘Études’ is the first series of the ‘Notations’ collection. ‘Notations’ will explore various notation techniques around the world and will use different sonification techniques and generative music algorithms.\n\nIn this series, a sonification process has been used to generate sound.\n\nSome articulations or accidentals intentionally exist due to aesthetic preferences. For example there are some musically meaningless things like vibrato on a piano or a coda sign on a motif. And some notes will play the same pitch (even if they appear apart from one another) depending on the chosen scale.\n\nSonification tends to work better after 2nd (or even 3rd) play. Some minor audio bugs might occur.\n\nThere is a major but a rare bug which we intentionally kept in; it plays a generative piece from indicated pitches rather than just playing the motif only once.\n\nThere is a rare possibility that ‘Études’ can generate an ‘electronic’ result which plays with a FM synth instead of piano. \n\nProbabilities;\n\n- 12 root notes\n\n- 12 different scales\n\n- Dynamics; pp,p,mp,mf,f,ff or none\n\n- Dynamic changes; crescendo and diminuendo or none\n\n- 4 different noteheads\n\n- Several accidentals and articulations\n\n- Vibrato might occur on some outputs\n\n- 3 font styles\n\n- 4 background textures\n\n\nMade with p5.js\nIlgın İçözü, March 2022(Reissued-September 2022)\n@distcollective",
