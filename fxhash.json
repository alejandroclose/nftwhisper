            "description": "Lines, our simple geometric friends, are nice and neat ideal forms. Until they’re not. Here they shake, crumble, twist and bend. Just like everything else in our fragile world. We put a lot of faith in lines, from marking out political borders to defining our designs, but maybe they aren’t as reliable as they seem.\n\nIn this work we make small, probing journeys into the space between pure shiny mathematics and the brittle chaos of materiality that this math tries to define. Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.\n\nI like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!\n\nMade with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.\n\nThere’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter. Sometimes unnoticed, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with angst. But always with a kind of truth. And I hope this work can conjure a kind of hazy evocation of all this. The message is only meant to be a feeling, at most.\n\n## Generate a printable version\n\nTo generate a version for printing, add the search parameter `?print=true` to the url. This disables the initial animation and doens't trigger a canvas resize when the window changes size.\n\nYou can then also add your preferred width of canvas by adding a `width` parameter, eg: `?print=true&width=2000`. Depending on your browser there's a limit to the maximum width you can use. Using Chrome on an Apple M1 laptop, I can go up to a width of 4700px, but experiment with what works for you.\n\nOnce the image is ready, press [s] on your keyboard to save as a PNG.\n\nTested in all major browsers on Apple silicon and on windows PC with an Intel chip.",

            "description": "Shattered Obelisks began as a work that is dedicated to my habit of mindlessly drawing on paper when I am stressed, depressed or immersed in difficult thoughts.\n\nLike a patient undergoing psychotherapy and piecing together the causes of unconscious fears and anxieties, I and my artwork have assembled ourselves into something shaped, found order in the chaos and separated it from the external noise.\n\nIt took 3 months of continuous, obsessive work. I have developed a huge library, designed for hand-like drawing. The functionality of this library is four times larger than what is shown in this drop.\n\nI plan to put this library out into the public domain when I deem it complete, and hope that it will help someone express themselves through the creative process as much as it helped for me.\n\nIn case you've encountered a problem with inverted colours, try changing browser or disabling extensions. This problem only occurred once during testing on a massive amount of devices and was resolved by disabling extensions.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES BLOCK:\n\nNOTE 1: This artwork should be viewed at a browser scale of 100%. Reducing the scale will increase the amount of detail, but may unpredictably affect the preservation of the location of secondary objects.\n\nNOTE 2: This work can be printed on a plotter. Click S for saving it in .SVG.\nDetailed instructions and answers to possible questions can be found in the console output of the code.\n\nNOTE 3: This drop is the first one from the series of 3. It will be used as AL ticket in next drops of this series.\n\n@abakshonokoleg\n01.08.2022\nTech: P5.JS\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

One additional, rare color palette will slowly cycle through the full color spectrum.\n- Direction: Up, Right, Up Right\n- Seed: Up, Right, Up Left\n- Shape Tendency: Tetra, Box, Sphere, Octa, Ico, Multi\n- Amount: Low, Medium, High\n\nVIEWING\n\n- The artwork is in landscape format, please click on open to see the full frame and resolution. We recommend rotating your screen on mobile.\n- Press 'i' to show artwork title and features.\n- Press 's' to save an image.\n- To guarantee the same output at different resolutions the simulation driving the artwork is locked at 1024x512 pixels. To unlock, press 'u' - this can help when running at a lower resolution and the animation is not smooth, or when running at significanly higher resolutions and pixelation is starting to occur. Please note this will break the deterministic nature of the work.\n- Best viewed in Chrome Desktop with dedicated GPU.\n- Please note: requires latest devices (supporting WebGL2) for a smooth experience.\n",

The tip of the triangle is the uterus which makes the space grow.\n-- LIA DREI (Diaries, 2004)\n\nMy paintings have no past, they are empty of meaning in the present, but await the discussions of the future, as remotely as possible.\nAnd this is why they don't have their feet firmly planted in the ground, although there are invisible roots that take life from the earth, like so many blades of grass.\nWhile I work I look for the truth in what I do. The time is not yesterday because it would be false, it is not today because the emotion takes my breath away and I die every moment and am reborn after every new brushstroke.\nSoon after, time becomes old, useless, meaningless. I never know what will come out with the next brushstroke or spatula stroke.\nMy thoughts go at supersonic speed and only stop to choose another color. The one just painted is never the right one. So I live the life of the new painting with the sense of mystery that the moonless night has. (…)\n-- LIA DREI (Notes, 1962)\n\n----\n\nI never talk about myself.\n\nI'm not creative.\nI blatantly steal other people's art.\nI'm a bad coder, I copy, paste, mix ideas.\nI often ruin it, degrade it.\nBut I always make it mine what I like.\n\nI absorb.\n\n-- ALESSANDRO FIORE (fxhash, 2024)\n\n\n—————\n\nThe work is created responsive by default and it will adapt to the browser window.

            "description": "\nIn 2021, I enrolled in a course about Genius, Inspiration, and Madness across ancient, European, and American traditions. A central theme of the course was a recurrent exploration of the Apollonian-Dionysian dichotomy described by Nietzsche in his seminal work \"The Birth of Tragedy\". Nietzsche contrasts the Apollonian (order, structure, rationality) with the Dionysian (chaos, emotion, primal nature) and suggests the interplay between these two drives is essential for creating profound art, reflecting the complexity of human nature. \n\nFor me, this study extended beyond academic curiosity. It reshaped my perspective, elevating a concept I was superficially familiar with into a recurring theme I observed in my life or applied in my artistic pursuits.\n\n\"Appearance and Being\" (Schein und Sein) aims to build upon the explorations of my previous works, \"Sol\" and \"Space & Ego,\" effectively serving as a third installment in an ongoing study. The series uses handpicked cellular automata rules at a close-up, through which I consciously navigate the space between strict structure and organic unpredictability. I start with a rudimentary, perfectly square form distorting it to the point of obtuseness. The ironically sharp edges of these obtuse elements, juxtaposed against a fading, concealed underlying structure, balance authenticity and aesthetics.\n\nAll works are designed with plottability in mind, aiming to convey solids, stripes, and gradients through lines.\n\nRecommended pen tips for plotting are:\n\nSolid iterations: 0.4mm (size 04), but also works across a range of pens.\nStriped iterations: 0.4mm (size 04), but also works across a range of pens.\nGradient iterations: 0.2mm (size 005), also works with smaller sizes. \n\nOne rare color palette combination was inspired by a wonderful book I discovered at my local library - Edith Young's \"Color Scheme.\" The book offers many different palettes across a diverse set of subjects. From these, I selected and merged two favorites to create a two-color palette - The Pupils of the eyes in Vermeer's portraits (1656-72) and The reds of the red caps in Renaissance portraits (1460-1535).  \n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a PNG of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete SVG file for plotting.\n\nAnd this is a redeemable project in case you’d like to receive a physical plot!\n\nPixel Love!",
