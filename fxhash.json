            "description": "A balanced combination of spatial subdivision and algorithm sonification. A subdivision surface algorithm is recursive in nature: the process starts with a base level of area, and a refinement scheme is then applied to this field. This process takes that element and subdivides it, creating new segmented areas. The positions of the new areas are computed based on the positions of nearby old fields, edges, and/or faces. A cellular automata is running on the texture of some of these areas, building continuous, tautological worlds of binary patterns and relationships. Thus, unfolding of a pixel’s ‘umwelt’ can be witnessed through the slow, contemplative process.\n\nThe audio synthesis consists of a stochastic melody that emerges along the division of the new areas and territories within the image structure. This melody is complemented with tiny micro sounds, triggered by each new generation of the surface mounted cellular automata. \n\nTouch to listen",

            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

By weaving these timelines at different points in time, almost infinite variations can be made. The changing relationship between the two creates dynamic and unique compositions and challenges the visual perception.\n\n## Guide:\n- Please note that the animation responds to window aspect ratio. This is an intentional behavior as part of interactivity. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- To export image at specific size, use URL parameters as below.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.3.1 with Chrome 101.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction:\n- [0] for exhibit. it switches to a different mode every 3 loops.\n- [s] to export PNG image. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause animation\n- [1 ~ 5] for different play modes\n- [1]: all \n- [2]: surficial \n- [3]: constant \n- [4]: all-constant\n- [5]: structural\n- [h] to toggle hi-DPI mode. (for retina display)\n\n## URL Parameters:\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&mode=exhibit&w=800&st=5.3\n- [mode]: play mode (exhibit, all, surficial, constant, all-constant, structural)\n- [w]: width.

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

            "description": "\n// AUTOHIRST - THE CRYPTOCURRENCY is a generative\n// art project that uses code and blockchain technology to \n// create artworks that explore the relationship between value, \n// wealth, and art. This project is inspired by a well-known artist\n// who has addressed similar themes in their work, but aims to offer a\n// fresh and innovative perspective on these themes through the use of \n// generative art technology.\n\n// By using code and algorithms to create these artworks,\n// unique and original pieces are created that are not bound \n// by the limitations of traditional media. In contrast to some \n// traditional art practices, which can sometimes rely entirely on \n// the labor of others to create large pieces or collections of art, \n// these automated artworks are created entirely by code, requiring no \n// human intervention. This approach allows for a commentary on the \n// hypocrisy of wealthy artists who profit from NFT technology while \n// continuing to rely on the labor of others to create their art in this \n// ecosystem. This goes against the spirit of Web 3, which aims to empower \n// individuals and decentralize power. Many wealthy artists take advantage \n// of lesser known artists in different ways, and this collection is a \n// challenge to traditional power structures and encourages viewers to think \n// critically about the value systems that shape our society and the future of \n// the digital art space.\n\n// The project generates an image over the span of 60 seconds. \n// As the end of the 60 seconds approaches, the code becomes increasingly \n// specific about the points it plots until it finishes the piece at the \n// 60-second mark.\n\n// AUTOHIRST - THE CRYPTOCURRENCY, also uses a random phrase generator \n// to create a unique phrase for the title of each piece.  This random phrase \n// generator uses randomness provided by the fxrand function so each piece always \n// has a unique title paired with it, or a \"seed phrase\" if you will...\n\n// The main purpose of the random phrase generator in this project is to inspire \n// thoughts and ideas based on the mainly crypto-related phrases it generates. \n// By providing a diverse range of phrases, the generator encourages users to think \n// creatively and come up with new ideas that are related to the world of cryptocurrency.\n// In addition to inspiring creative and innovative ideas, the random phrase generator \n// in this project also aims to inject a bit of humor into the mix. The generator generates \n// a wide range of phrases that are often comical or absurd, which can be a great \n// source of entertainment and enjoyment.\n\n// To use the generator in your own projects, simply include the code in your project\n// and call the generator function whenever you want to generate a new phrase. You can \n// customize the generator by adding your own lists of words or phrases to use as input, \n// or by modifying the generator function to suit your specific needs.\n\n//Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License\n\n// Code + Artwork Copyright (c) 2022 \"AUTOHIRST\" \n// https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/autohirst\n// https://twitter.com/AUTOHlRST\n",

            "description": "This 3D HTML + CSS based work utilizes only a limited amount of javascript to construct the scene and facilitate interactive controls. 🚫 <canvas>! Continuing the collab with my alternate identity HTMLCSS.TEZ\n\nThe practice of layering many graphic shapes and gradients with a chaotic mix of blending modes has been with me since my first years of photoshop in my youth. It's a familiar, friendly technique. Yet, I've rarely played with it outside photoshop. Here I take the opportunity to apply this abstract blending technique in a manner that alludes to reality: refracting crystals.\n\nThese generated crystals are not based in fact but imagination. They are illustrative of the magic and wonder some people associate with real life minerals and rocks. They blend together with impossible color changes only possible in the virtual.\n\nEach individual crystal element can be one of these blend modes (with chance):\ndifference (9/16), exclusion (2/16), hard-light (2/16), color-dodge (1/16), overlay (1/16), normal (1/16)\n\nControls:\nPlay/Pause - [Space]\nRotate - [Click + Drag]\nMove - [Shit + Click + Drag]\n\nMinter's Reward: 1/3 Secondary royalties",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens —created in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco— that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking “what if” questions such as “What if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?” Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road —one direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature— it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario’s thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",

            "description": "Elasticity is a collection that explores the ambiguity of discrete continuity in architecture.\n\nElasticity is a tectonic, generative system that combines simple, discrete parts into an elastic relationship between part and whole, creating a discrete and continuous elastic form. A form that celebrates the continuity of digital variation while respecting a discrete approach to a digital whole.\n\nIt is a generative follow-up to the project CM.CollabWood, where the same parts were embedded in a real-time participatory architectural environment, where clusters of parts were placed by participants in real-time in collective design sessions to create tangible collective open forms.\n\n___________________________________________________\nControls:\n• 'P' pause/play animation\n• 'B' monochrome mode (wait a bit for recalculation)\n\nResize Canvas in live/open mode:\n(press once and wait for recalculation!)\n• 'DoubleClick' go Fullscreen\n• '1' square 1024x1024\n• '2' square 2048x2048\n• '3' square 3072x3072\n• '4' square 4096x4096 (might not work on all laptops)\n• '5' landscape 4000x3000\n• '6' portrait 3000x4000\n• '7' fullHD 1920x1080\n• '8' UHD 3840 x 2160\n• '9' square small(for sharing a gif on twitter) 512x512\n• '0' flex. adapt to current window size\n\nSave & Export in live/open mode:\n• 's' save a .png of in current resolution\n• 'g' save a seamless loop .gif in current resolution\n(press the key and wait for export, might take some time, consider with higher resolutions files get pretty big)\n\nSteps to save a gif/png :\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• resize canvas to your desired resolution (wait)\n• press s or g and wait for recalculation & download to finish\n• enjoy elasticity :)\n___________________________________________________\n\n\nThis token may not work on mobile(!), but it allows exporting .png and .gif (see controls) to enjoy elasticity on different displays or mobile.
