And while we devise systems for solving unfathomably complex problems, generating algorithmic creativity, and unlocking regenerative biological possibilities, we simultaneously cling to the power and originality of emotional feeling – believing it to be the irreplaceable source of what makes us human.\n\nIf the body is our shell for emotion and soul, can an artificial humanoid be another vessel for these thoughts and feelings – for human essence itself? If our ‘soul’ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable? That we may see answers to these questions looks more real every year, and is perhaps a little frightening. \n\nEmotional Shell uses introspective portraits of future selves to question what it means to be human, when the people around us are no longer human.\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 1-3 to select from low, medium, and high quality settings\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2400px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nTENDER x wwatkns\nAugust 2022",

            "description": "INSPIRATION\n\nSpirali was inspired by Tyler Hobbs' work with flow fields. However, instead of selecting random starting points for each shape to be drawn, which is more usual in flow fields works, I wanted to constrain the starting points to certain positions so that the shape being drawn could expand freely without the risk of colliding with other shapes, that's when I got to the spiral flow field.\n\nWHY SPIRALI?\n\nThe name of this collection is not only a direct translation of spirals in Italian, but it is also related to Italian cuisine and my own personal experience in Italy. The relationship with Italian cuisine is due to the immense number of types of pasta that exist, including one called spirali. When I was a child I only knew three or four types of pasta, but when I became a bit older I was amazed to learn that there were many more. Actually, there are hundreds. Just like from the same type of basic dough, you can make hundreds of types of pasta, my idea was, from just one type of spiral flow field, to make hundreds of images. A strategy of forcing creativity by imposing a major constraint.\n\nThe name of this collection also relates to my personal experience because it was visiting Italy many years ago that I first became interested in art and design because of the beautiful buildings, churches and works of art that I came across.\n\nDESIGN STRATEGY\n\nA spirali is made up of several tails and each tail is made up of a basic element, which I called slice. A tail may have from one to thousands slices. It is mainly the variation in the number of slices and how they are colored that creates the different tail styles in each spirali.\n\nThe slices start at the center of the spiral and in each iteration they grow a certain length or split in two depending on the parameters used in the algorithm, which also determine the outline and fill of each slice when it is rendered.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe main features that a spirali can have are:\n\n- Styles: Refers to the drawing patterns of each tail, that means, the shape, fill and stroke of the slices that form the tail. There are about 16 possible styles from which the algorithm will choose about 3 for each spirali.\n\n- Zoom out: It is related to how much larger the flow field area is in comparison to the image area. There are two possibilities: 50% and 100%.\n\n- Curvature: An arbitrary measure of the rate the tails of a spirali are turning. A spirali can have high or low curvature.\n\n- Rotation: The rotation direction: clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n- Tails: The number of tails in a spirali.\n\n- Palette: The palette's name. There are about 14 possible palettes.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n\n- Press \"m\" to export a medium resolution image (2000px x 2000px);\n- Press \"h\" to export a high resolution image (6000px x 6000px);\n\nLICENSING\n\nPlease see license.txt file.\n\nTwitter: @PauloSilvaGArt\nSite: https://paulosilva.art",

            "description": "INSPIRATION\n\nSpirali was inspired by Tyler Hobbs' work with flow fields. However, instead of selecting random starting points for each shape to be drawn, which is more usual in flow fields works, I wanted to constrain the starting points to certain positions so that the shape being drawn could expand freely without the risk of colliding with other shapes, that's when I got to the spiral flow field.\n\nWHY SPIRALI?\n\nThe name of this collection is not only a direct translation of spirals in Italian, but it is also related to Italian cuisine and my own personal experience in Italy. The relationship with Italian cuisine is due to the immense number of types of pasta that exist, including one called spirali. When I was a child I only knew three or four types of pasta, but when I became a bit older I was amazed to learn that there were many more. Actually, there are hundreds. Just like from the same type of basic dough, you can make hundreds of types of pasta, my idea was, from just one type of spiral flow field, to make hundreds of images. A strategy of forcing creativity by imposing a major constraint.\n\nThe name of this collection also relates to my personal experience because it was visiting Italy many years ago that I first became interested in art and design because of the beautiful buildings, churches and works of art that I came across.\n\nDESIGN STRATEGY\n\nA spirali is made up of several tails and each tail is made up of a basic element, which I called slice. A tail may have from one to thousands slices. It is mainly the variation in the number of slices and how they are colored that creates the different tail styles in each spirali.\n\nThe slices start at the center of the spiral and in each iteration they grow a certain length or split in two depending on the parameters used in the algorithm, which also determine the outline and fill of each slice when it is rendered.\n\nFEATURES\n\nThe main features that a spirali can have are:\n\n- Styles: Refers to the drawing patterns of each tail, that means, the shape, fill and stroke of the slices that form the tail. There are about 16 possible styles from which the algorithm will choose about 3 for each spirali.\n\n- Zoom out: It is related to how much larger the flow field area is in comparison to the image area. There are two possibilities: 50% and 100%.\n\n- Curvature: An arbitrary measure of the rate the tails of a spirali are turning. A spirali can have high or low curvature.\n\n- Rotation: The rotation direction: clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\n- Tails: The number of tails in a spirali.\n\n- Palette: The palette's name. There are about 14 possible palettes.\n\nCOMMANDS:\n\n- Press \"m\" to export a medium resolution image (2000px x 2000px);\n- Press \"h\" to export a high resolution image (6000px x 6000px);\n\nLICENSING\n\nPlease see license.txt file.\n\nTwitter: @PauloSilvaGArt\nSite: https://paulosilva.art",

            "description": "Redols is a piece about the automated arrangement of geometrical shapes in space and how the images generated can foster different moods. It visually investigates how to adjust the amount of randomness and repetition -both in the code loops and in the visual composition- to create structures that contain the mere essence of geometry and of movement.\n\nIt explores the repetitive use of a simple geometric shape: the circle. Adds some counterpoints to enhance it: squares, lines, and triangles which are found in the background. It focuses on circular shapes, not always drawing exactly. They change their core, their measure, the color, the gradient, or some subtle details. The arrangement uses an elliptical distribution and replicates some shapes to promote the visual recognition of bigger parts thus enhancing the movement feeling.\n\nRedols is my genesis piece at fxhash curated by VerticalCrypto Art and Anika Meier.\nExhibited at IN TOUCH: art in the age of post-nftism show at Dekabinett, Berlin, september 2022.\n\nRedols means circular shapes, not perfect ones, in Catalan and is an investigation of how deterministic processes and algorithms can create appealing arrangements that foster non machinic agencies and sentiments.\n\nThe piece is created by code, coding it from scratch, mixing, and mastering basic drawing techniques. This approach pays attention to the art piece getting old -I hope well- and makes it easier to show and view it on different computers and platforms to prevent its obsolescence.\n\nI tested on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Mac OS, Ubuntu, Android, and iPhone in vertical and horizontal mode, but please check it works on your device before minting.\n\n----\npossible features:\n- colors:  super fosc marro, super blau, taronja-marro, taronja-blau, marro-taronja, marro-blau, blau-taronja, blau-marro.\n- fons: quadradets, escaires, diagonals.\n- fonsple: true, false.\n- redols: equilibrat, mironia, migmig, degradats, vespa, mandarina, us, os, pla.\n- fons2diagonals: true, false.\n\nAnna Carreras 2022",

The iterations will be titled ____ - Iteration 1, ____ - Iteration 2, etc. At this point, the number of iterations has not been determined, but more information will be provided as this experiment unfolds.\n\nThe final release will only be made available to those who have collected each iteration (using an allowlist), and will be released for free.\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

            "description": "Mountains throughout human history have taken on deep meanings. Coated with immense sacredness by all peoples in the most different places. Being them as a representation of God himself or being the object of worship. For many the mountains were the very abode of the Gods. They are in the collective unconscious as the ability to connect men and gods, through the flow of energy between earth and heaven.\n\nThe symbology is very strong. It unconsciously reminds us of the process of encounter between the loneliness of the earth and the hope of the sky, between the fog that blinds and the cloud that supports, between the abyss of the ground and the proximity of the stars. All this is very charming and fascinating.\n\nAll human beings have their own mountain, which demands from each one their limits to reach the top, the desire for the breathtaking view, the fear of falling, but also the hope of the last step at the highest point.\n\nIn generative art it couldn't be different, going through all the learning, from its fundamentals, to all the countless hours of tests, to countless moments of problem solving and research and more research. This whole process is without a doubt like climbing a mountain. Thinking about the project is exactly like looking at a mountain and imagining how exhausting it will be all the way to conquer it. Finishing your work is like breathing a sigh of relief, looking down and seeing how hard it was to get there, but at the same time looking ahead and realizing how rewarding it was to be able to have that vision and breathe the refreshing breeze of the moment.\n\nAfter going through a transformation in my first work, where I transmuted my artistic essence from illustration to generative art. Now I come to this second work that I delved into, and after months of climbing this mountain of mine, I give it to you.\n\n\n- Press \"S\" in live view mode after loading to save at 1600x1600px.\n\nlicense: \nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nproject website:\nhttps://playman.me/projectmountain\n",
