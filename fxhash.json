            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. www.tribute-hwf.com\n\n\"Since the classical age of Greece, the golden ratio has been well known as the most balanced and therefore most aesthetically perfect proportion. In fact, it is supposedly often found in the fine arts and architecture and it is certainly important in geometry. But where is the proof that it is really the most beautiful proportion?\n\n\"The computer is proving to be a useful tool in exact art theory. Works of computer art are produced with the help of programs that describe the logic of the construction and its relevant measures. By varying the parameters you can vary the shapes of objects, and on the basis of the reaction of the public you can determine the best option. So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n\"A statistical evaluation would be interesting. Please email me with your results for the optimal proportion.\"\n\nI found it heartwarming that in 2011, Herbert W. Franke wrote the above, accompanied with a simple functional program on a Wolfram Demonstration page (https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/IsTheGoldenRatioReallyTheMostBeautifulProportion/) titled 'Is the Golden Ratio Really the Most Beautiful Proportion?' and invited people to submit their findings to him.\n\nThe main idea behind this project is ratios, a variety of them, used in a variety of ways, such as how a rectangle is repeatedly subdivided, or how it influences the aspect ratio of the piece, or how the colors in a palette are selected. These are represented in various styles, some of which are inspired by the aesthetic of Herbert W. Franke's diverse artworks, and his openness to experimentation with new technologies, such as plotter drawings, screens, screenprints, or 2D and 3D digital renderings.\n\nThis project, while not designed to be a formal statistical evaluation, is but my fun, colorful, and humble response to your inquiry, dear Herbert.\n\n---\n\n25% of primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke, with the goal of raising 20,000 Euros so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any money raised beyond this goal will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• Double-click/tap or 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n\nNote: Some mints require WEBGL and/or may take several seconds to fully render.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid",

            "description": "This is my little tribute to fx (hash and fam).\n\nDuring an important phone call, I was put on hold. Unconsciously, I began to scribble in my sketchbook. Research shows that scribbling helps focusing, but I dreamed away nonetheless until my pages were filled with scribbles, notes, shopping and a to-do list. \n\nMint a uniquely generated page from my non-existent 100% coded sketchbook (except text typography). \n\nThe page may contain many scribbles and drawings in pen, felt-tip pen, pencil, or less: often references to artists I admire, some in the form of loose scribbles, others in the form of riddles. Those drawings are drawn with code and vary. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to incorporate tributes to all art and every artist I admire. The sketchbook would never finish. Thanks to rudxane I know that it’s ok to publish something unfinished ;-). \n\nOne reference that appears in every token is to Sol Lewitt, an incredible source of inspiration. His artworks consist of instructions. Your sketch book pages contain instructions too. You will find the instructions for the artwork scribbled on your unique page by pressing i.\n\nCurious how the work would look without the ‘distracting’ scribbles and coffee stains? Press ‘a’, ‘w’, or ‘g’. \n\n800 x 800 px\n\nPress ‘s’ to save an image.\n\nMade with p5js and the amazing p5.scribble.js library by Janneck Wullschleger.\n\nFont used: Sacremento-Regular under the SIL Open Font License (OFL).\n\nSee license.md for the licenses of both.\n\nThank you all!

But not quite.\n\nIt started from a square, that was cracked into many fragments. From outside, it is still a square, stable, reliable. From inside, it is a mess, with many experiences, each one being unique, each one with its own specificity.\n\nEven though we relate to others, there is no definition of normal. No one looks the same. This is why the palettes are all generated and there can be an infinity of them. Some have more darkness than others. Some are warmer, some are cooler. Some are a mix of many things.\n\nOur experiences and our cracks shape us. Sometimes following a natural flow. Sometimes following specific rules. But always guiding us as a whole.\n\n----\n\nThe day I started working on this piece, I realized that I often show myself as chill, ready to give a hand, ready to listen to others. But who am I to help others when I'm not sure about who I am or even what I am?\n\nMaybe that's why I'm able to relate. Because I have my own experiences that cracked me. And built me. So even if I'm a mess, even if I'm not sure about where I'm going, let's share and try to find out together.\n\n----\n\n- The images are meant to be viewed in an horizontal full screen but will adapt to any format\n- Click on the image to restart the animation\n- Hit \"S\" key or long tap on mobile in the live view to trigger an export\n- Add &width=5000 to the live view URL to render the image at 5000 pixels wide\n\n----\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienPradetArt",

            "description": "I had a wonderful childhood. I grew up near a big lake, in a house with a huge garden. You could get lost for the whole day, building houses on trees, collecting flowers and stones or stealing food from the vegetable garden. Having a brother of the same age made things even better, endless adventures with somebody saving you every time you are too dumb to realize you are walking into troubles.\n\nWe enjoyed the summers with the hot days, the fireflies and the nights full of falling stars. The winters with the snow, the stalactites and our box turtle disappearing for months to then reappear in the spring (Until she did not).\n\nAt the same time, taking care of the garden was a big responsibility, affecting our family life in many ways. Numerous times, I felt like the efforts we were putting in to keep it in order were never enough and nature was always faster in restoring her point of view. A struggle that affects us humans since we started to bend nature at our will, thousands of years ago.\n\nIn my gardens, I tried to capture this struggle, this constant fight to shape nature at our will.\nHowever, I also tried to represent the beauty that can be found in both savage and human shaped nature, if shaped with love and respect.\n\nI dedicate this project to my grandfather, who gave us a garden.\nI am sure he would have loved it.\n\n---\n\nHand coded with love and obsession. 💚\n\nPowered by p5, p5.createLoop and chroma.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\nPress ‘m’ to open a menu with the available outputs.\n\nThe generation of a hi-res image, up to 8000x8000, takes a few seconds.\nThe generation of an Animated GIF takes several minutes and the save command works only once the GIF is complete.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters that can be used to load different configurations.\n\n- mode = 0 | 1\n0 For static PNG images, 1 for animated GIFs\n\n- size = s | m | l\nThe Size of the output, 1080x1080, 4000x4000, 8000x8000 for static images and 512x512, 800x800, 1080x1080 for animated GIFs\n\n- fps = 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30\nFrames per second of animated GIFs\n\n=============> PROFILES <==============\n\t\nWeeds ------------------> 42%\nShapes -----------------> 7%\nFlower Power -----------> 5%\nStrips -----------------> 5%\nBadlands ---------------> 5%\nCircle Flower Packing --> 5%\nIna's Farm -------------> 5%\nFortified Pond ---------> 3%\nFalling Into You -------> 3%\nCultivar ---------------> 2%\nThe Hedge --------------> 2%\nRocky Mountains --------> 2%\nUnreachable Rivers -----> 2%\nMushrooms Heaven -------> 2%\nDante ------------------> 1.75%\nAcid Lands -------------> 1.75%\nProvence ---------------> 1.5%\nThe Springs ------------> 1.25%\nSecret Garden ----------> 1%\nThe Pump ---------------> 1%\nTetris -----------------> 1%\nThe Spiral -------------> 0.5%\nKinetic Sculpture ------> 0.25%\n\nInsects are visible only in the animated outputs.\n\n=============> MAKING OF <=============\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/article/the-making-of-noisy-gardens\n\n---",
