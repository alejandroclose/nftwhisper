            "description": "An important element of generative art is emergence. The most famous algorithm for this is probably Cellular Automata (CA).\n\nHowever, numerous generative artists have created works using CA, which has lost its visual freshness and is like chewing gum that has lost its taste.\n\nAlthough it is such a classic algorithm, adding my own little ideas to it and finding a new \"flavor\" is the reason why I code.\n\nHere, the subject is 1D Elementary Cellular Automata, the simplest of all cellular automata. 1D Elementary Cellular Automata has 256 different rules, which change the shapes produced. This work aims to create more complex shapes by randomly selecting some of those rules and placing multiple of them on the screen.\n\nThe on/off of the CA cell is often likened to the behavior of living creatures.As of 2022, in the country where I live, prices are rising, wages are not increasing, and COVID-19 has not yet ended. I created this work with the image of people at the mercy of these various rules.\n\n---\n\nScreen click: Change rules\nS key: Save png\nL key: Show/hide grid\n",

            "description": "Collisions is my playful attempt to make art out of a physics engine. There are 8 \"scenes\" to pick from, 33 color palettes, and 10 block patterns.  It was fun trying to make art using p5play. I wanted the art to not only have an interesting animation, but to have a final image that was artful. p5play made it easy to simulate physics, including collisions, though there were some technical challenges to overcome.  Soon I'll work on a short series about p5play on my YouTube channel, Steve's Makerspace.\n\nThis is a 48-hour mint, and then the remaining will be burned.\n\nAfter opening the mint:\n\"s\" to save a 2000 x 2000 pixel png (Larger sizes or higher pixel density was causing animation issues.)\n\"t\" to save a png with three panels showing the beginning, middle, and end of the animation\n\nThe project uses p5.js and p5play (p5play.org), and finishes with a grain shader made by Dave Pagurek and Gorilla Sun.",

            "description": "This release marks my first anniversary on the fx(hash) platform! I want to extend a huge thank you to everyone for a fantastic year, and I'm looking forward to many more in the generative-art world!\n\nThe basic algorithm is an evolution of the one I used in my first release, Raked Strokes. Instead of mimicking a brush with parallel segments, I'm using perpendicular line segments to define the overall abstract shape and then drawing each line in a simulated media. This approach blends my first attempts at natural media with everything I've learned in the past year.\n\nViewing in desktop Chrome is recommended for the best results.\nPress 's' to save a screenshot. The image size is 2357x3000px\nPress 'p' to pause/resume during drawing.\n\nFeatures\n- Base path shape: line, circle, diamond, or rectangle\n- Elements defining the spacing and orientation of the line segments\n- The base path painted in the background\n- Monochrome, dark background, and selection of palettes\n- Ink pen styling: thickness, quality, and background blocking\n- Paint styling: color distribution, quality\n- Shapes: triangle, polygons, criteria for insertion\n- Shapes overdrawing: outlines or perpendicular segments\n\nCopyright (c) 2022 Matt Perkins, hello@mattperkins.me, @nudoru on Twitter.
