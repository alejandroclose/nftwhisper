This serves as a symbol of cleansing the mind and returning to primal simplicity.\nThis piece, instead of being filled with colors and patterns, speaks through its emptiness. Colorless spaces allow pure connections with forms and textures, revealing beauty in absence.\nBy emphasizing the concept of 'Lost Spaces,' this work delves into parts of our being that are usually overlooked. 'Lost Spaces' reminds us of the opportunities that lie within absence or imperfection. This canvas creates a space where emptiness is not seen as a lack but as an open realm for creativity, reflection, and new possibilities. Each line and color gently speak from their empty spaces, reminding us that even in absence and void, there is inherent meaning and beauty.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

Wonders that tell us about the distant past. It begins when the universe began to form and continues to this day. This geological formation, which was formed millions of years ago, is a masterpiece of earth maps that takes us to distant, complicated, and adventurous times. Textures of sedimentary rocks that preserve their beauty and special patterns tell a story of the journey of nature's superpower. Thin layers of blue, green, and red stones, make a valuable past for us; From water currents, solar eclipses, and deep underground fun.\nAnd finally, I conclude that the earth is an infinite museum of beauty and history.

In the period when the earth speaks of itself with a call of love and passion in every moment of life. When the heart sinks into the past, each emotion has its people.

I want to talk about its sedimentary textures and its various colors, signs of an infinite path of time, and natural changes that have affected it, and each piece of it tells a mysterious story of its journey through time; From its formation in the depths of the seas and rivers to the emergence on the surface of the earth. A natural miracle, which, with its beauty, draws us to a world of greatness and wonder. Grooves that scream from the depths of time remind us that everything in this world is an infinite and beautiful journey, and we are part of this great world.\nPerhaps it is a symbol of beauty and stability in the stone world. Wonders that tell us about the distant past. It begins when the universe began to form and continues to this day. This geological formation, which was formed millions of years ago, is a masterpiece of earth maps that takes us to distant, complicated, and adventurous times. Textures of sedimentary rocks that preserve their beauty and special patterns tell a story of the journey of nature's superpower. Thin layers of blue, green, and red stones, make a valuable past for us; From water currents, solar eclipses, and deep underground fun.\nAnd finally, I conclude that the earth is an infinite museum of beauty and history.
