            "description": "Henge is an exploration of circular megalithic structures of the prehistoric age. It is a work of historical fiction where these stone assemblies, achieved through herculean efforts of stacking, aligning, and balancing immense chiseled rocks, are reimagined within an alternate universe of algorithmic possibility. Historically, henges share a few qualities that inspired this project. First, they are places of gathering within a loose collection of stones to organize ceremony or worship under celestial alignments. They are also monolithic in their materiality and employ the most elemental techniques of megalithic, or large stone, construction. These particular types of henges, known as cromlechs, are circular spaces fit with purpose and ritual and in this sense, serve as precedents to the great human edifices; charging landscapes with meaning and presence through geometry and order. Finally, henges are a collective language of place-making shared across a range of cultures and ages, from the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras and across territories from modern-day Morocco, Portugal, Brazil, Germany, Scandinavia, to the well-known Stonehenge in Great Britain.\n\nThis project is deeply inspired by the timeless and universal narrative created through the thoughtful and deliberate placement of large rocks in a circle. It seems that when confronted with marking a place and communing with nature, human beings like to make circles out of stones. Among all the symbols of place making, the circle is the original and still remains the most universal. Through the use of code to portray these imperfect structures, Henge animates the history of these circles in all their roughness and seemingly endless variation.\n\n\n--------\n\nCreated by Aranda\\Lasch @ArandaLasch\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\nNovember 2022\n\n[Interaction instructions]\n'left' + 'right' arrow keys to change view\n'i' saves a 2048x2048 PNG\n\n[Info]\np5.js\nHenge is optimized for Chrome, runs slowly on Firefox (the longer the wait, the more stones and/or grass are being generated)\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n10% of all primary and secondary proceeds donated directly to Girls Who Code\n",

            "description": "This project was started in December 2021. At that time, I didn't know what the result would be. It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

Random and repetitive animations are based on patterns that are erased and recreated each time. The movement, which pauses randomly in the flow and then erases and recreates every texture, culminates in a unique animation.\n\n*Start and stop animation: press ‘Q’\n*Save image: press 'W' to save the current image as a PNG.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nV0X3I\\IA © 2023 by NUBPLUS is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 ",

Searching for the possibility of depicting this rhythm, texture, and space opens this opportunity as a new experience for me. And how can I convert time to image? In this work, I have depicted the circle of wandering, like the sun that fluctuates in every horizon and climate, sometimes hot and tense and sometimes its rays like the morning breeze caressing our face, calling us to a new beginning. Where is your sun on the horizon, and what time is it in your world?\nMade in p5js\nCreated July 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "This special edition of Divide By Circle uses only 2 color designs which were not possible in the original. The aspect ratio has been \"unsquared\" to 3:2 for postcard and poster printing.\n\nThis set will be self minted and air dropped to collectors using a lottery system where iterations of Divide by Circles are the tickets. Winners will be chosen by generating a random number up to 512 and checking who owns that Divide by Circle. These are limited to one per person, so another number will be picked if there are any repeats. Once awarded the winner is free to sell or transfer the token.\n\nA limited run of 25 postcards will be printed, signed, and numbered for each iteration in the set. The original 25 winners have a month to contact me via email or twitter with a postage address to send the card.\n\nDue to the unpredictable nature of the postal system I can't guarantee everyone will receive their postcard but I will try my best. If there are any unclaimed cards after a month, they will be given away by other means.
