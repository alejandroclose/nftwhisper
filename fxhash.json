            "description": "\"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a magical kingdom known for its beautiful landscapes and mystical creatures. The kingdom was ruled by a kind and fair queen, who loved nothing more than to spend her days exploring the vast and varied terrain of her realm.\n\nOne day, the queen was wandering through a particularly cold and snowy region of the kingdom when she came upon a strange sight. Instead of snow, the ground was covered with soft, fluffy balls of wool, as if the earth itself had been transformed into a giant ball of yarn.\n\nThe queen was fascinated by this curious phenomenon, and she decided to follow the trail of wool to see where it led. After walking for some time, she came upon a beautiful lake, the surface of which was frozen solid. But instead of ice, the lake was made entirely of woolen fibers, swirling and twirling in the gentle breeze.\n\nThe queen marveled at the sight, and she couldn't help but reach out and touch the soft, velvety surface of the woolen lake. As she did, she felt a warmth and comfort wash over her, as if the wool were alive and pulsing with energy.\n\nOver the years, the queen visited the woolen lake often, always feeling a sense of peace and contentment when she was near it. And as the years went by, the people of the kingdom began to flock to the woolen lake, seeking the same sense of warmth and comfort that the queen had found.\n\nThe woolen lake became a beloved and sacred place in the kingdom, and it was known throughout the land as the \"mar de lã\" - the sea of wool. And so it remained, a magical and mystical place that brought joy and happiness to all who visited.\"\n_AI GPT\n\nMade with <3 and p5.js",

After walking for some time, she came upon a beautiful lake, the surface of which was frozen solid. But instead of ice, the lake was made entirely of woolen fibers, swirling and twirling in the gentle breeze.\n\nThe queen marveled at the sight, and she couldn't help but reach out and touch the soft, velvety surface of the woolen lake. As she did, she felt a warmth and comfort wash over her, as if the wool were alive and pulsing with energy.\n\nOver the years, the queen visited the woolen lake often, always feeling a sense of peace and contentment when she was near it. And as the years went by, the people of the kingdom began to flock to the woolen lake, seeking the same sense of warmth and comfort that the queen had found.\n\nThe woolen lake became a beloved and sacred place in the kingdom, and it was known throughout the land as the \"mar de lã\" - the sea of wool. And so it remained, a magical and mystical place that brought joy and happiness to all who visited.\"\n_AI GPT\n\nMade with <3 and p5.js",

It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

            "description": "\"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a magical kingdom known for its beautiful landscapes and mystical creatures. The kingdom was ruled by a kind and fair queen, who loved nothing more than to spend her days exploring the vast and varied terrain of her realm.\n\nOne day, the queen was wandering through a particularly cold and snowy region of the kingdom when she came upon a strange sight. Instead of snow, the ground was covered with soft, fluffy balls of wool, as if the earth itself had been transformed into a giant ball of yarn.\n\nThe queen was fascinated by this curious phenomenon, and she decided to follow the trail of wool to see where it led. After walking for some time, she came upon a beautiful lake, the surface of which was frozen solid. But instead of ice, the lake was made entirely of woolen fibers, swirling and twirling in the gentle breeze.\n\nThe queen marveled at the sight, and she couldn't help but reach out and touch the soft, velvety surface of the woolen lake. As she did, she felt a warmth and comfort wash over her, as if the wool were alive and pulsing with energy.\n\nOver the years, the queen visited the woolen lake often, always feeling a sense of peace and contentment when she was near it. And as the years went by, the people of the kingdom began to flock to the woolen lake, seeking the same sense of warmth and comfort that the queen had found.\n\nThe woolen lake became a beloved and sacred place in the kingdom, and it was known throughout the land as the \"mar de lã\" - the sea of wool. And so it remained, a magical and mystical place that brought joy and happiness to all who visited.\"\n_AI GPT\n\nMade with <3 and p5.js",

            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "\"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a magical kingdom known for its beautiful landscapes and mystical creatures. The kingdom was ruled by a kind and fair queen, who loved nothing more than to spend her days exploring the vast and varied terrain of her realm.\n\nOne day, the queen was wandering through a particularly cold and snowy region of the kingdom when she came upon a strange sight. Instead of snow, the ground was covered with soft, fluffy balls of wool, as if the earth itself had been transformed into a giant ball of yarn.\n\nThe queen was fascinated by this curious phenomenon, and she decided to follow the trail of wool to see where it led. After walking for some time, she came upon a beautiful lake, the surface of which was frozen solid. But instead of ice, the lake was made entirely of woolen fibers, swirling and twirling in the gentle breeze.\n\nThe queen marveled at the sight, and she couldn't help but reach out and touch the soft, velvety surface of the woolen lake. As she did, she felt a warmth and comfort wash over her, as if the wool were alive and pulsing with energy.\n\nOver the years, the queen visited the woolen lake often, always feeling a sense of peace and contentment when she was near it. And as the years went by, the people of the kingdom began to flock to the woolen lake, seeking the same sense of warmth and comfort that the queen had found.\n\nThe woolen lake became a beloved and sacred place in the kingdom, and it was known throughout the land as the \"mar de lã\" - the sea of wool. And so it remained, a magical and mystical place that brought joy and happiness to all who visited.\"\n_AI GPT\n\nMade with <3 and p5.js",
