            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

Caustic Obstacles uses progressive monte carlo rendering, meaning that at first the image will appear noisy, but over time it will become smoother. It may take up to several minutes for the noise to become unnoticeable (or longer, if you specify a very high resolution). The piece is never officially \"done\" rendering, but instead becomes asymptotically smoother with time - take your screenshots whenever you feel it's smooth enough!\n\nUse the url \"width\" parameter to change the resolution of the piece, e.g. \"/?width=2160\". Every edition is rendered in a 5x7 aspect ratio, and the height will be determined automatically based on the width specified. This means that the height will be determined with the formula width * 7 / 5, rounded up. By default the width is 1080, which results in a height of 1512, while a width of, for example, 2160, would result in a height of 3024.\n\n\n\n–––––––\nTENDER x ella\nDecember 2023  \nCaustic Obstacles is a generative art series created by Ella Hoeppner in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n–––––––",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

One inspiration to follow this path came from Matt's appreciation for Guil's published children's book: Elephants on Tour (available in multiple languages).\n\n\n—\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\n—\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n• https://roadtrip.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://roadtrip.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n—\n\nKeyboard Controls:\n[q] - Open .GIF export panel\n[u] - Get link to updated version\n[space] - Pause",

            "description": "“Winesburg, Ohio” is an act of uncanny place-making. The collection borrows its name from a 1919 short-story cycle by Sherwood Anderson, which explores a peculiar cast of characters living within a fictionalized, midwestern town. Like Anderson’s text, the “Winesburg, Ohio” algorithm constructs a world through recurring portrayals of specific structures and landmarks. Its scenes are populated by a variety of familiar elements taken from my larger body of work, including water towers, houses, and churches. Meanwhile, a series of scripted gestures insert abstract compositional elements into the outputs, counteracting their pictorial legibility. The strange landscapes that result are composite ideograms, comprised of multiple spatial possibilities that co-exist in varying states of contradiction.",

Caustic Obstacles uses progressive monte carlo rendering, meaning that at first the image will appear noisy, but over time it will become smoother. It may take up to several minutes for the noise to become unnoticeable (or longer, if you specify a very high resolution). The piece is never officially \"done\" rendering, but instead becomes asymptotically smoother with time - take your screenshots whenever you feel it's smooth enough!\n\nUse the url \"width\" parameter to change the resolution of the piece, e.g. \"/?width=2160\". Every edition is rendered in a 5x7 aspect ratio, and the height will be determined automatically based on the width specified. This means that the height will be determined with the formula width * 7 / 5, rounded up. By default the width is 1080, which results in a height of 1512, while a width of, for example, 2160, would result in a height of 3024.\n\n\n\n–––––––\nTENDER x ella\nDecember 2023  \nCaustic Obstacles is a generative art series created by Ella Hoeppner in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n–––––––",

Today, our most basic human rights are being ignored in Iran, and we fight for them every day. In my land, women fight and die but do not accept humiliation. Women and men stand shoulder to shoulder and fight together.\n\n🟢I published this collection of 1401 generative tokens to show my support for the people of Iran. 401 tokens are reserved for other known supporters of this cause, and 1000 tokens are free to mint.\n\n🟢All my works about Iran's freedom are royalty-free and will always be. Due to fxhash's limitation on royalty selection, I have selected it all for the minter.\n\n✅After completing the token animation, you can save the image in the following sizes and apply the following color filters: \n\n⌨️ SPACE key   ⏩ No Animation\n⌨️ \"r\"   key   🔁 Reset All Filters\n⌨️ \"c\"   key   ▶️  Random Tint Mode\n⌨️ \"g\"   key   ▶️  Grayscale Mode\n⌨️ \"t\"   key   ▶️  Black & White Mode (Normal)\n⌨️ \"y\"   key   ▶️  Black & White Mode (Darker)\n⌨️ \"u\"   key   ▶️  Black & White Mode (Brighter)\n⌨️ \"i\"   key   ▶️  Invert Mode\n⌨️ \"p\"   key   ▶️  Random Posterized Mode\n\n⌨️ Key number  1️⃣  1000✖️1000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  2️⃣  2000✖️2000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  3️⃣  3000✖️3000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  4️⃣  4000✖️4000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  5️⃣  5000✖️5000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  6️⃣  6000✖️6000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  7️⃣  7000✖️7000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  8️⃣  8000✖️8000 pixels\n⌨️ Key number  0️⃣  16000✖️16000 pixels\n\n🅿️5️⃣ Built with p5js\n\n🔆Generative art by Arash",
