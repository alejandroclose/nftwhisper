            "description": "The initial spark for this piece started with Armin Hofmann’s exercises in style and composition. Just as George Nelson wrote in the preface to Armin’s book Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practices: \"Despite all our efforts to simplify things - efforts constantly expanding in order to keep abreast of steadily increasing complexity - nothing is very simple anymore\", these explorations just opened doors to other issues, and further grounded the idea that \"if problems can be correctly stated, they can be solved.\"\n\nArmin suggests we go back to the beginning, to concern ourselves with dots and circles and lines and then bring opposed components in confrontation. \"Confrontation is a theme on which variations can be played with any desired consonances, with any imaginable values, and in a great variety of ways. [...] (Only then) (s)he will be able to find creative solutions to the problems presented by the confrontation of opposites.\"\n\nVery quickly opposed components, even with extending the angle of vision from the two-dimensional surface to the three-dimensional space, and with the contrasts of thin-thick, solid-transparent, softened-hardened line, etc., started looking like I’m weaving complicated plots, visually similar to textile works by  Bauhaus women - Gunta Stölzl, Anni Albers, Gertrud Preiswerk and others.\n\nWhen Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919, he proclaimed that “every eligible person whose talent and training are considered adequate will be accepted without regard to age and sex.” However, in practice, discriminatory gender roles were reinforced, and female students were guided and advised to work with textiles rather than in workshops for heavy crafts such as carpentry. Despite that, Gropius’s “women’s section” became one of its most collaborative and brave experimental sectors. \n\nA hundred years later, it is disappointing to see we still carry on with inherited gender roles. Check the number of female computer science students in your country. How are things going \"at the intersection of arts and technology\"? I've implemented some of the percentages from Serbia in the distribution of shapes in the final compositions. I sampled the number of female vs. male students at the Faculty of Mathematics and the University of Arts (where I studied and now work), and gender distribution among graduated students, and it didn't look bad at all. But then I realized I'm the only female professor (out of 5) teaching main subjects at doctoral studies program in digital arts.\n\n\"When a group is underrepresented, people come to take that underrepresentation as the norm.\" Since representation is imperative to achieving equality, it is equally critical to change the biases we’ve developed over centuries.\n\nFor the title, I chose a dated version of the word for a female weaver on purpose. My native language is one of the Slavic languages, which are all gender sensitive. It is natural to have feminitives, but since historically some occupations were less (or not at all) practiced by women, many of the feminitives for those professions, jobs, and specializations are rarely used or don't exist in the dictionary. Also, not surprisingly, the dominant version of the noun describing a person who weaves in Serbian would be the female noun \"tkalja\", whereas the male version is so rare that is missing from some dictionaries. Conscientiously choosing the female version of the noun for the title, I position myself and this piece in the historical context with Bauhaus weveresses, contemporary language, and gender contexts, and finally in the curatorial context of the exhibition. \n\nCode Weaveresses is part of the FEMGEN exhibition curated by Micol Ap @verticalcrypoto in partnership with @RtClick_Save and @artblocks_io.\n",

At what point do you feel the dots begin to dissolve into a texture? When do you stop noticing the dots and instead begin to perceive the overall composition?\n\nThese questions are posed in a similar fashion as with meditation; at what point does something become something else? When does an in-breath become an out-breath and vice versa? \n\nContemplation on simple questions like these can open a small portal into stillness and mindfulness by taking time to slowly observe our responses. \n\n23 palettes are included, each named after different areas of Tokyo. \n\nPress 'S' to download a full size 6000px x 6000px PNG output. \n\nAs always, much gratitude and enjoy your piece.

            "description": "The Citizen PFP Project is a unique project in the NFT world. Prior to this project, most PFP designers focused on producing tokens that are highly and visually competitive in minimal structure and visual form. But the Citizen PFP Project has a unique beginning, and I believe it will have a bright future. I even have a plan to produce coins with this title. And all these goals can be achieved only with the initial sale by minting all 2500 editions of this token and successfully entering to the secondary market.\n\nIn the following, I will give a specialized review of PFP tokens which published until now. After a thorough study of the PFP market, I came to the conclusion that all the published collections so far have been content with a common theme, form, and appearance.\n\nInformation:\n\nSubject: Creating a set of characters with a common moral character. Form: Promote the theme in the form of unique designs and visual effects with the aim of distinguishing it from its competitors. Appearance: Applied full shot and medium shot views for all other published collections.\nBut this project is seriously different from all its competitors. Its competitive advantages is as follows:\n\n1- For the first time, a design in the framework of a close-up view, which has been unique and obvious so far. The most visual feature of Citizen PFP.\n\n2- Designing different states of human emotions in a structure in such a way that in different hashes you will see states such as: happy, sad, excited, surprised, bored, worried, regretful, and many more.\n\n3- Unique characterized Citizen's building by combining image layers in all 2500 versions.\n\nNext step of the project:\nIn the next step, all of the extracted characters will be produced and released in full shot view and in different modes of life processes and occupations.\n\nClosing remarks:\nBecause I had the opportunity and motivation to produce a small portion of future PFP characters, I need to appreciate people who supported me. \nSpecial thanks to the management team of fx(hash), women In gen-art and all the dear collectors.",
