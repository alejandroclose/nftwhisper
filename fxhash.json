            "description": "CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG is an homage to Ohne Titel (1969–1970) by Verena Loewensberg.\n\n2 of 5 in CENTURY-XXX, Series 2\nEdition of 128\n\nCENTURY-XXX is a series of software sketches that pay tribute to artists of the 20th century. Each piece is named after a specific artist and reimagines one of their original works through code, often by adding motion, variation, or interactive elements. These sketches don’t replicate the original artworks but instead extend their core ideas into new forms.\n\nBy “software sketch,” I mean something more informal than a finished artwork. While some of my projects take months or even years to complete, these sketches are created quickly—often in just a few days. They may be lighter in process, but they’re equally important to me. Sketching with code is how I think through ideas and discover new directions for future work.\n\nThe project began with the CENTURY exhibition at DAM Projects in Berlin in fall 2012, where I premiered Network C, Network D, and the first Signal to Noise software piece. Since then, these sketches have inspired more full-scale artworks like METASOTO, METAVASARELY, METAMOLNAR (also known as Hommage à Molnar), including the eponymous CENTURY released through Art Blocks in June 2021.\n\nCENTURY-XXX Series 1 was released from December 2021 to January 2022 in editions of 1,000. The first artwork in Series 2 followed in October 2022, also in an edition of 1,000. The remaining four works in Series 2 are scheduled for release starting in 2025, each in smaller editions of fewer than 128 based on what feels appropriate for the individual piece.\n\nThe long-term vision for CENTURY-XXX is to create 100 software sketches, each one inspired by a different artist and artwork from the 20th century.\n\nSERIES 1\n1.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMETAMALEVICH\n1.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMOLNAR(S)\n1.3 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMORELLET\n1.4 — CENTURY-XXX-METARILEY\n1.5 — CENTURY-XXX-METAKELLY\n\nSERIES 2\n2.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE\n2.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG\n\nMore CENTURY-XXX’s to come…",

These sketches don’t replicate the original artworks but instead extend their core ideas into new forms.\n\nBy “software sketch,” I mean something more informal than a finished artwork.

There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

            "description": "POEMS IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN [PITPD] represents a new form of poetic anthology—one that celebrates the role of the reader in shaping the life of a poem. In this unique art piece, 14 readers take turns discovering 30 classic poems. We invite collectors to explore this compendium, selected to present a diverse, engaging archive that acknowledges the importance of certain seminal works in shaping our collective unconscious. \n\nInspired by Roland Barthe's maxim, \"those who fail to reread are obliged to read the same story everywhere,\" each reader is represented by multiple pen colors & new marginalia, suggesting the crucial act of rereading. \n\nThe verses vanish, just like our memory of their exact words might fade, but distilled, standout moments of personal connection remain. In time, even these wane, providing a scarcely perceptible backdrop as the poem is discovered & interpreted anew. \n\nPITPD explores authorship. When a poem enters the public domain, it no longer belongs to its author but to its readers. In the intimate moments we read a poem, we link it to our private, pulsating worlds & help ensure others will read it, too. If history’s palms hadn’t held Sappho’s words, our fingers wouldn’t hold them now. \n\nReaders write poetry’s survival. \n\nEach iteration of PITPD traces a narrative that can play for hours without repeating. Some 89% of iterations chronicle the life of a single poem, while 11% include multiple poems, intentionally surveying intertextuality. Taking advantage of the generative medium, embodied readership is represented via dynamic handwriting, dancing markings, algorithmic paper aging, coded stains, & other effects.\n\nSpacebar pauses & resumes the animation. Refreshing the browser window restarts it. For those interested in the underlying code, please open the browser console. This collection’s ciphers, too, are in the public domain.\n\nAdditional information can be found in the companion article on fx(text): fxhash.xyz/article/poems-in-the-public-domain-marginalia-as-living-verse",
