The key to this orderly world is the use of the right angle.\n\nThus, everything has its place, and a place exists for everything.\n\n---\n\nYou can download various versions of this artwork :\n\n- press \"p\" to download a PNG at the current resolution of your browser\n- press \"h\" to download a high-resolution PNG (8K) suitable for print\n- press \"s\" to download an SVG version that you can then use to generate any image size\n\n---\n\nCoded with care, and with the help of p5.js, p5.js-svg and polybooljs libraries.\nConsider any bug that you could get in your edition as a blessing from the RNG Gods !",

This grid can be used as a basis for stacking a more or less large set of tetragons, and they combine with each other to form polygons, enhanced by a minimalist palette of colors, inspired by the work of Mondrian. The key to this orderly world is the use of the right angle.\n\nThus, everything has its place, and a place exists for everything.\n\n---\n\nYou can download various versions of this artwork :\n\n- press \"p\" to download a PNG at the current resolution of your browser\n- press \"h\" to download a high-resolution PNG (8K) suitable for print\n- press \"s\" to download an SVG version that you can then use to generate any image size\n\n---\n\nCoded with care, and with the help of p5.js, p5.js-svg and polybooljs libraries.\nConsider any bug that you could get in your edition as a blessing from the RNG Gods !",

It is the record of nature's beauty, which often appears like a momentary revelation; and its effect is to show us how much beauty is around us that we never attend to, and by whose presence we are cheered and elevated in unobserved and unsuspected hours of depression or anxiety.”\nJohn Ruskin\n\n In this collection, I aimed to design the essence of my utopia. Instead of my usual interactive and animated designs, I created a drawing that gives the impression of lithographic printing on 2D black paper, where textures remain static. I wanted the nature objects to have a slightly dark, somewhat Fauvist style. I sought a balance between their depressive nature and the hopeful tranquility of natural light sources, which evoked the feeling I was searching for.\n\n*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as png.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.\n\n“Stratification of the Orthogonal”\n“Agora of Timeless”\n“Surely, There is an Exit”\n\nEveryone who owns the above collections is entitled to a free mint right in this collection.

            "description": "\"Landscape painting is the contemplation of the earth's features made visible to us in their most perfect moments. It is the record of nature's beauty, which often appears like a momentary revelation; and its effect is to show us how much beauty is around us that we never attend to, and by whose presence we are cheered and elevated in unobserved and unsuspected hours of depression or anxiety.”\nJohn Ruskin\n\n In this collection, I aimed to design the essence of my utopia. Instead of my usual interactive and animated designs, I created a drawing that gives the impression of lithographic printing on 2D black paper, where textures remain static. I wanted the nature objects to have a slightly dark, somewhat Fauvist style. I sought a balance between their depressive nature and the hopeful tranquility of natural light sources, which evoked the feeling I was searching for.\n\n*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as png.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.\n\n“Stratification of the Orthogonal”\n“Agora of Timeless”\n“Surely, There is an Exit”\n\nEveryone who owns the above collections is entitled to a free mint right in this collection. It will be open for a few days specifically for you.\n\nThe remaining supply will be reopened as a paid mint for everyone at a later time. !",

This grid can be used as a basis for stacking a more or less large set of tetragons, and they combine with each other to form polygons, enhanced by a minimalist palette of colors, inspired by the work of Mondrian. The key to this orderly world is the use of the right angle.\n\nThus, everything has its place, and a place exists for everything.\n\n---\n\nYou can download various versions of this artwork :\n\n- press \"p\" to download a PNG at the current resolution of your browser\n- press \"h\" to download a high-resolution PNG (8K) suitable for print\n- press \"s\" to download an SVG version that you can then use to generate any image size\n\n---\n\nCoded with care, and with the help of p5.js, p5.js-svg and polybooljs libraries.\nConsider any bug that you could get in your edition as a blessing from the RNG Gods !",

It combines the joy of interaction, digital color and minimalist sculpture with the potential of a long running, continuously unique visual. Based on “Shipping” from 2016, it is inspired by Anne Truitt, Ugo Rondinone, Imi Knoebel, Kelly Ellsworth and many others.\n\nA subdivision slices the viewport influenced by width, height and depth. Corners are cut by replacing them with two new points, pulled towards each other along the edges. Shapes are “rounded\" by repeating this step, keeping the new points close together. As colors change, so do the relations between shapes, even if geometry changes at a slower pace. New compositions are created on click or after a timeout. This progress over time allows for infinite iterations within the space of each token. It is the promise of a seeded starting point, plus the potential for unlimited new and unique iterations and states over time.",

Xuan paper is occasionally used as background, which is a painting material since the Tang dynasty.\n\nMei's outputs span different stages of plum blossom from winter to spring. The scene also changes from a calm day to snowy or even stormy weather. The consistent yet complex senses and feelings reflected are surprisingly versatile.",

It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens.

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",
