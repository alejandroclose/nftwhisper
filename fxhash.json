Most strokes are blurred, some are repeating.\n\nAll editions share the same base color palette. From it three different palettes are derived for the light, medium and dark colors. Press 'c' to get a better idea of how this works.\n\nInitial sketch made for the Weekly Creative Coding Challenge hosted by Raphaël de Courville (@Sableraph).\n\nCommands:\nf = fullscreen toggle\nb = change window background color\nc = color palettes overlay toggle\ns = save image at 1080 x 1920 pixels\np = save image at 3240 x 5760 pixels",

            "description": "Schwere See\n(...which is german for \"Heavy Seas\")\n\nthis work creates completely generative ocean worlds between the real and the surreal.\nwhat is real? when do we feel reality? i guess as with many other things, we feel reality best when we're deprived of it.\nThat might be the reason why it never ceases to fascinate us to both exaggerate and abstract nature and reality - maybe even at the same time.\nthat's where this work tries to go...\ngiving my best to create realistic looking waves out of hmm... thin electron-gas..., and then disrupt those from realism by unnaturally exaggerating waveforms and abstracting the display to a few colors and lines - ...well, not so few of the latter, actually ;-)\n\nbeware: this needs a good GPU (at least here in 2023) to properly run in realtime.\nstills can still be rendered on a low end machine with on-board graphics, but for realtime playing you'd need some proper dedicated graphics card.\nand of course it wont run fast (or maybe not all) on your mobile phone (except maybe on a very high end device).\n\nthe different mints vary in wave shape, color, camera view, animation speed, aspect ratio, frame style, hatching density, field of view, and more.\nsome color schemes are based on pre-chosen palettes (slightly varied though), but others are wildly random-generated. there's always some risk in randomness, but lets give the error some chance to surprise us - this is one of the many benefits of generative art.\n\nas generative art can do so much more than just generate/show an image i feel almost obliged to add the possibility to animate/inteact.\nhowever, this extra control shall not be chosen without some considerations. \nyou don't want a strobingly wild animation above your fireplace or in a doctors waiting room. nor is it motion-wise very inspiring to have subtle image stills hanging in a dancefloor.\nso, by default when in animation mode (<space>-key) the scene is very slowly and steadily changing - some pieces faster, some slower. however, by pressing <f> you can toggle to a sped up animation of waves, clouds, and scene rotation.\nbtw, going faster in nav-mode also speeds up the wave animation. (...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px). It may last for high numbers.\nWe recommend the use of Chrome browser in order to render properly the texture.\n\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 × 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.net",

            "description": "At moment we decide to draw a square on top of a circle, we are defining a time arrow, a third dimension on the 2D plane, where shapes can be on o top of each other, come one after the other. In this project i wanted to remove that time arrow, that third dimension, and leave the 2D plane as flat as possible.\n\nShapes are not drawn in sequence, they are formed by the continuous addition of points to each region defined by the shapes intersections. Not a single region is on top of the other. They are the result of the combination of shapes, and defined by them. Horizontal, decentralized societies. Espacios comunes. We can see the circles, squares, plane cuts, but we cannot give them an order or authority.\n\n-----\n\nKey controls:\n\n- UP arrow: Increases the sketch resolution. It will take longer to render but it will produce better quality images.\n- DOWN arrow: Decreases the sketch resolution.\n- f: Removes or adds an empty frame around the image.\n- d: Increases the points density. More points will be painted and regions will become more full.\n- n: Increases the pixel noise.\n- b: Decreases the pixel noise.\n- z: Switches on and off the simple pixel sorting algorithm. Move the mouse left and right to change the pixel stickiness.\n- x: Switches on and off a more complex version of the pixel sorting algorithm.\n- i: Displays some log information.\n- p: Pauses the sketch.\n- s: Saves a screenshot of the artwork. The image resolution will depend on the sketch resolution, which is controlled by the UP and DOWN arrows.\n\n-----\n\nURL controls:\n\nwidth=2000 will set the sketch width to 2000 pixels.\nproportion=2.3 will set the sketch width-to-height ratio to 2.3.\nYou can combine these two parameters to create any image output you want. For example, to create an image that is 3000 pixels wide and 5000 pixels high, one just needs to add &width=3000&proportion=0.6 to the URL.\n\n-----\n\nSpecial thanks to @andregorayeb (Gora) and @ItonkStudio (Itonk) for letting me use some of their color palettes for this project.\n\n-----\n\nLicense: CC BY 4.0\n\nThis project makes use of the p5.js library.

            "description": "\"Garden, Monoliths\" is the result of an algorithm that started in April 2021. It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

            "description": "Schwere See\n(...which is german for \"Heavy Seas\")\n\nthis work creates completely generative ocean worlds between the real and the surreal.\nwhat is real? when do we feel reality? i guess as with many other things, we feel reality best when we're deprived of it.\nThat might be the reason why it never ceases to fascinate us to both exaggerate and abstract nature and reality - maybe even at the same time.\nthat's where this work tries to go...\ngiving my best to create realistic looking waves out of hmm... thin electron-gas..., and then disrupt those from realism by unnaturally exaggerating waveforms and abstracting the display to a few colors and lines - ...well, not so few of the latter, actually ;-)\n\nbeware: this needs a good GPU (at least here in 2023) to properly run in realtime.\nstills can still be rendered on a low end machine with on-board graphics, but for realtime playing you'd need some proper dedicated graphics card.\nand of course it wont run fast (or maybe not all) on your mobile phone (except maybe on a very high end device).\n\nthe different mints vary in wave shape, color, camera view, animation speed, aspect ratio, frame style, hatching density, field of view, and more.\nsome color schemes are based on pre-chosen palettes (slightly varied though), but others are wildly random-generated. there's always some risk in randomness, but lets give the error some chance to surprise us - this is one of the many benefits of generative art.\n\nas generative art can do so much more than just generate/show an image i feel almost obliged to add the possibility to animate/inteact.\nhowever, this extra control shall not be chosen without some considerations. \nyou don't want a strobingly wild animation above your fireplace or in a doctors waiting room. nor is it motion-wise very inspiring to have subtle image stills hanging in a dancefloor.\nso, by default when in animation mode (<space>-key) the scene is very slowly and steadily changing - some pieces faster, some slower. however, by pressing <f> you can toggle to a sped up animation of waves, clouds, and scene rotation.\nbtw, going faster in nav-mode also speeds up the wave animation. (...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

            "description": "Whether by choice or circumstance, we often find our lives thrust into uncertainty. We're resilient, though — we find patterns in the chaos, deciphering and unraveling it piece by piece until a new comfort emerges. `gradient descent` is my expression of that cyclical flow that comes to dominate our lives.\n\nThe piece starts with comfort, a smooth gradient chosen from a curated palette. As the animation runs, that gradient is mutated by a unique sequence of linear transformations - slice, skew or stride on an underlying grid - as it descends into uncertainty. After a time the animation will reverse, peeling back each transformation and returning to comfort before beginning anew.\n\nThe menu - which can be accessed with a double click or Escape - gives you extensive control of the experience. I'd encourage you to explore these settings — they transform the feel of the piece, allowing you to adapt it to match your environment or mood. Any setting that can be changed in the menu can also be provided as a URL parameter - there's a button in the menu to export them all.\n\nBuilt with raw WebGL 1.0, optimised to run smoothly on most devices.\n\nBest viewed in full screen on large format displays.\n\n||| controls\n\n[hold space] ⇝ speed up\n[esc/2xclick] ⇝ toggle menu\n[g] ⇝ toggle gallery mode\n[p] ⇝ toggle pause\n[s] ⇝ capture current frame\n[a] ⇝ capture all keyframes\n[8/9/0/-] ⇝ change viewport\n\n||| settings\n\nAll settings are configurable via the interactive menu.

Some browsers may require confirmation to save multiple stills. When triggered early, unrendered keyframes will be blank.
