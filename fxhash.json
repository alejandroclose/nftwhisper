These experiences pile up to form the foundation for everything to come, shaping our perspectives and influencing our sense of self, character, and worldview.\n\n'Pile' embraces the infinite possibilities of generative art to represent the rich, complex, and cumulative nature of life's experiences through the passage of time. Each moment builds on top of previous memories, where the present is always the sharpest, yet is soon obscured by what follows. Just as the imprint of past experiences can linger in our lives, the influences of older layers can still be seen in each piece, imbuing each composition with a depth and variety that is indicative of life's many histories. Composed of these textured and stacked layers, ‘Pile’ forms a dense and organic heap that embodies the controlled chaos of life's multitudes.\n\nResponses to our experiences tend to oscillate between thoughtfully pragmatic and mechanical means – and more sensitive, organic, and even passionate approaches. They’re a blur of exactitude and wildness, entropy and growth, a range of experiences and outcomes that vary so greatly that only by changing our perspectives and taking a step back can we see the commonality between each of our piles of life’s moments. The result is a visual representation of the cumulative nature of life's experiences, where forgotten moments and cherished memories are piled high with abandon, yet worthy of celebration.\n\nInspired by the works of artists such as Jackson Pollock and Joan Mitchell, 'Pile' invites us to contemplate the rich and multifaceted nature of life, and to celebrate the distinctive stories that each of us carries within. Through its vivid abstraction of life's controlled chaos, and the tension between organic lines and overtly digital marks, 'pile' beckons us to consider the intricacies of our own layered identities and to revel in the diversity of life.\n\ncreated in p5.js.\n\n_________________________\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press ‘p’ to save png\n- Press ‘1’ - ‘9’ to run a high resolution file (higher resolution files will take longer to load)\n",

            "description": "Our realities appear as a layering of moments, emotions, and choices that accumulate through space and time. These experiences pile up to form the foundation for everything to come, shaping our perspectives and influencing our sense of self, character, and worldview.\n\n'Pile' embraces the infinite possibilities of generative art to represent the rich, complex, and cumulative nature of life's experiences through the passage of time. Each moment builds on top of previous memories, where the present is always the sharpest, yet is soon obscured by what follows. Just as the imprint of past experiences can linger in our lives, the influences of older layers can still be seen in each piece, imbuing each composition with a depth and variety that is indicative of life's many histories. Composed of these textured and stacked layers, ‘Pile’ forms a dense and organic heap that embodies the controlled chaos of life's multitudes.\n\nResponses to our experiences tend to oscillate between thoughtfully pragmatic and mechanical means – and more sensitive, organic, and even passionate approaches. They’re a blur of exactitude and wildness, entropy and growth, a range of experiences and outcomes that vary so greatly that only by changing our perspectives and taking a step back can we see the commonality between each of our piles of life’s moments. The result is a visual representation of the cumulative nature of life's experiences, where forgotten moments and cherished memories are piled high with abandon, yet worthy of celebration.\n\nInspired by the works of artists such as Jackson Pollock and Joan Mitchell, 'Pile' invites us to contemplate the rich and multifaceted nature of life, and to celebrate the distinctive stories that each of us carries within. Through its vivid abstraction of life's controlled chaos, and the tension between organic lines and overtly digital marks, 'pile' beckons us to consider the intricacies of our own layered identities and to revel in the diversity of life.\n\ncreated in p5.js.\n\n_________________________\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press ‘p’ to save png\n- Press ‘1’ - ‘9’ to run a high resolution file (higher resolution files will take longer to load)\n",

            "description": "Step by Step explores the feeling of being stuck, confined - walking the path ahead of you often only seeing the immediate next step until exhaustion. We all feel this way from time to time — in our lives, jobs, bodies, situations — yet in our search for something, we shouldn't forget that there can still be beauty along the path.\n\nThe project takes some inspiration from Henri Matisse, both in the aesthetics of his later works (i.e. the \"Cut Outs\") and metaphorically in the sense that he had underwent medical treatment which left him wheelchair- or bed-bound towards the later part of his life, forcing him to give up painting, yet in his exploration of this new creative medium which involved cutting paper and pinning them up, his unorthodox work went on to become the most transformative of his career.\n\nReleased as part of the 4th edition of the Cure³ Parkinson's cure fundraiser exhibition organized by Artwise Curators and Bonhams as part of a specially comissioned selection of generative artists minting NFTs, curated by Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick with the support of fx(hash) at Bonhams, London from 13-17th January 2023.\n\n---\n33% of primary sales and 3% of secondary sales will be donated on-chain to Cure Parkinson’s\n---\n\nControls:\n• 'R' regenerates the piece (e.g. in case the window size changes)\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Jan 2023\nArtist: Yazid",

While most of the country’s wine comes from the region of Cuyo, specifically the province of Mendoza, there is another hidden gem that is often overlooked: Entre Rios.\n\nNamed after the two massive rivers that surround it, Entre Rios is a province located in the northeast of Argentina. What many people don’t know is that it boasts a long and fascinating history of wine production that dates back to the early 19th century.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Entre Rios, I had the pleasure of exploring a small vineyard located near the Parana river.

It was clear to me that there was something truly special about the vineyards of Entre Rios.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the region’s history, I discovered that until 1937, Entre Rios was one of the largest wine producers in the country, with over 60 vineyards operating in the province.

It wasn’t until 1993 that the law was repealed, allowing vineyards to be planted and modified throughout the country.\n\nToday, Entre Rios is home to a small but thriving wine industry that is known for its unique blends and varietals.

            "description": "And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses\nHad the look of flowers that are looked at.\n- T.S. Eliot, Four Quartets: Burnt Norton (1936)\n\nThis work is an attempt to encapsulate in an algorithm, not the likeness of a flower, but the likeness of a painting of a flower. If, according to a very old definition, art is an imitation of nature, this is an imitation of an imitation – a sort of meta-imitation of nature by means of computer code.\n\nThe challenge for this piece was to capture some of the looseness and fluidity of the human hand when holding a brush or a pencil, and reproducing some typical forms of hand-made scribbles, doodles and brush strokes. However, absent the materiality of paint and canvas, everything is simulated here on the base of a very simple resource: circles. Everything you see is built of very many overlapping circles of varying sizes, colors and opacities. It is circles all the way down…\n\nInspiration for this work comes from a number of expressionist painters, from 20th century classics like Cy Twombly, to the magnificent contemporary work of Philip Maltman: https://www.instagram.com/philipmaltman/\n\nThis work is animated.\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 1000 x 1000 resolution. Please note that rendering at high resolutions can be slow.\n\nMade with the open-source libraries p5.js and chroma.js\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "Kyma (/kee-ma/, κύμα) is a Greek word meaning wave. It is my exploration of an acoustic phenomenon known as ‘Chladni Patterns’. \n\nErnst Florens Friedrich Chladni was a German physicist and musician. He was a pioneer of modern acoustics and made numerous contributions to the field. Chladni's work had a significant influence on the development of modern music theory and the technology of musical instruments. In 1787, Chladni was trying to understand how sound waves propagate and interact with objects. By vibrating a metal plate and sprinkling sand on it, he observed that the sand arranged itself into distinct patterns. These patterns are created due to the interaction between the sound waves and the plate: the sound waves cause the plate to vibrate, which in turn causes the sand to move. The sand will move away from areas of high vibration and towards areas of low vibration. This creates a unique pattern of ridges, circles, and many other shapes.\n\nKyma continues this study by adding color, light, and composition to the equation. Each iteration is a unique combination of two Chladni plates with different characteristics, accompanied by a palette, background lighting, and variational drawing algorithm. Plates interact with each other, forming patterns from the small detailed net-like grid to megalithic sculptures of unknown creatures and windows to another worlds.\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.\n\nRendering can be computationally heavy, please be patient and give it some time to draw.\nChrome is highly recommended for live mode and high res saving.\n\nMade with love, math, and p5js. \n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG 2400 x 1600\n[2] - save PNG 4800 x 3200\n[3] - save PNG 9600 x 6400\n[4] - save PNG 14400 x 9600",
