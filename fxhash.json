Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "Tapawingo employs a fundamental structure, essentially an isometric grid, which is constructed row by row and simultaneously rotated around a specific point. Remarkably, such a simple configuration can yield incredibly diverse, abstract results that are unique in their variation.\n\nThe resultant outputs can undergo radical changes in the final moments, frequently leading to entirely unanticipated end products. A significant level of randomness, coupled with a multitude of variables, have been seamlessly incorporated into this project, all within a remarkably straightforward framework. This truly empowers the algorithm to generate creations beyond our wildest imaginations. The code contains minimal curation, which occasionally leads to less-than-ideal outcomes. For instance, at times, the color scheme and rotation might converge in a way that leaves the canvas predominantly empty. Although this is an infrequent occurrence, it can happen.\n\nThe blocks' visual portrayal can be mentally challenging, as discerning their orientation can be tricky. It often necessitates viewing the sketch being drawn to reconcile the correct perspective.\n\nTapawingo's creations are fully responsive and are designed to display exceptionally well on high-resolution screens or when printed in large formats. The renderings adjust to the smaller dimension of your display's height or width while maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio. For greater control over the size, you can specify dimensions using URL parameters, the details of which are outlined below.\n\nThis is a free mint only because I don't want my feelings hurt. :)\n \n\nControls\n--------\n[mouse click] - start/stop the sketch\n[r] - redraw the sketch\n[s] - save a .png\n\nURL Params\n----------\n?size=xxxx where xxxx is a size in pixels you'd like to render\n\nFeatures Descriptions\n---------------------\nCell Size - the size of each cell in the grid\nColor Scheme - refers to the coloring of the left, right, top and outline for each block.\nBlock Spacing - the padding between the block and the borders of each cell.\nBlock Height Scheme - \"noisy\" blocks get their height from random noise that is smoothed using the Noise Smoothing variable and \"linear\" blocks get their height as a function of the distance from a randomly chosen block.\nMaximum Height & Amplitude - these control the height of the blocks and the disparity between those heights.\nStroke Weight - the thickness of the outlines for each block.\nRotation Type - \"noisy\" rotation gets random rotation movement using Perlin noise that is smoothed with the Noise Smoothing variable and \"linear\" rotation is constant rotation that moves in a uniform manner.\nRotate Around Center - the rotation point can either be the center of the canvas or a randomly chosen point elsewhere on the canvas.\nNoise Smoothing - used to determine how smooth or ruggedly noise driven elements of the sketch are rendered.\nSuper Blocks - with a nod to Fidenzas, this determines whether the blocks are broken up into individual blocks or traditionally rendered as one block.",

            "description": "\"◉◉◉\" presents a collection of pointillistic drawings generated by p5js. However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.\n\"◉◉◉\" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.\n\nThe technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",
