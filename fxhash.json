The people worked together to support each other in making their dreams come true. The balloons and ships became symbols of unity and hope, and Harmony remained a shining example of what can be achieved through determination and perseverance.\n\n- look for the gold mode\n- hit 'p' for png export\n- hit 's' for svg export",

            "description": "A response to being buffeted by forces outside of our control. Platonics sought to find order, control and solace in the Platonic solids. Instead it found beauty and intrigue in the emergent chaos that can arise from even the simplest systems.\n\nIts building blocks are the five Platonic solids. Forms which have fascinated humanity for thousands of years. Their title comes from the philosophy of Plato, who equated each of the solids with a classical element.\n\nPlatonics arranges these forms in a series of geometric layouts, with varying density and randomness. At one extreme we see tidy radial circles consisting of a single solid. At the other, packed pentagons consisting of jumbled solids give rise to Escher-esque compositions which hold near infinite variety, variety enhanced by a range of pens and colours that draw and fill those solids.\n\nThis relationship between order and disorder is at the heart of Platonics. The collection seeks to show how they are not so far removed from one another – and how we might embrace them both. It also aims to give collectors a behind the scenes look at how generative compositions can be constructed.\n\nThe geometric proof that there are only five convex regular polyhedra (the Platonic solids) states that at each vertex of the solid the angles between adjacent sides must be less than 360 degrees. This amount less than 360 degrees is known as the defect angle.\n\nIt is from this geometric proof that the collection size and pricing for Platonics is derived. There will be 360 Platonics sold via a Dutch auction priced according to the defect angles of the five Platonic solids: 180 > 120 > 90 > 60 > 36.\n\nhttps://www.phaust.art/platonics\n\n----------\n\nCompetition: Submit your favourite previews via Twitter to win a free mint and print.\n\nPrints: Free gallery-grade, signed A3 prints for the first 18 mints.\n\nLive: Press ‘S’ to save in hi-res or append '&size=#' to the URL for custom height.\n\nInfo: Original artwork by Phaust.

            "description": "RAUSCH is a series of generative artworks that explore imaginary digital architectures. \n\nThis series challenges traditional notions of architectural representation and raises important questions about the role of resolution in design. Just as the pixel resolution of an image affects its perceived quality, the resolution of an architectural space can affect its qualities and livability. By embracing digital variation through codes, this series explores the interplay between abstract and concrete space through multiple resolutions. \n\nRAUSCH is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by complex, chaotic and messy sensations, and aims to engage the viewer through a sense of wonder, disorientation, and awe.\n\nReleased on the occasion of Companions of Code, a group exhibition by VerticalCrypto Art at The NFT Gallery in London. \nCurated by Micol Ap.

            "description": "Form, an essential aspect in architectural design, refers to the shape, structure and arrangement of spaces or objects. Witnessing how forms work in a space can also be a transcendental experience, where one can sense the presence of a form, not only seeing it.\n\nAs there are many ways to create it, Form can appear as an internal structure, as an external shape of a two dimensional plane that envelopes a three dimensional mass, or a repetition of a two dimensional shape that stacks on an axis and moves to a certain direction. With so many ways to create shape, there is no law dictating that shape has to be rigid. And this is where Milunic and Gehry's design for the Dancing House comes in as an inspiration for this work.\n\nA change in the political axis from one of a regime to a parliamentary democracy was what influenced the architects to juxtapose two different energies together. With its dynamic and static shapes in tandem, Dancing House is one iconic proof that form can also be pliable and animated.\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\nworks better with chrome\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Feb23",

            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "Mountains throughout human history have taken on deep meanings. Coated with immense sacredness by all peoples in the most different places. Being them as a representation of God himself or being the object of worship. For many the mountains were the very abode of the Gods. They are in the collective unconscious as the ability to connect men and gods, through the flow of energy between earth and heaven.\n\nThe symbology is very strong. It unconsciously reminds us of the process of encounter between the loneliness of the earth and the hope of the sky, between the fog that blinds and the cloud that supports, between the abyss of the ground and the proximity of the stars. All this is very charming and fascinating.\n\nAll human beings have their own mountain, which demands from each one their limits to reach the top, the desire for the breathtaking view, the fear of falling, but also the hope of the last step at the highest point.\n\nIn generative art it couldn't be different, going through all the learning, from its fundamentals, to all the countless hours of tests, to countless moments of problem solving and research and more research. This whole process is without a doubt like climbing a mountain. Thinking about the project is exactly like looking at a mountain and imagining how exhausting it will be all the way to conquer it. Finishing your work is like breathing a sigh of relief, looking down and seeing how hard it was to get there, but at the same time looking ahead and realizing how rewarding it was to be able to have that vision and breathe the refreshing breeze of the moment.\n\nAfter going through a transformation in my first work, where I transmuted my artistic essence from illustration to generative art.

            "description": "\"flow | meditations\" is part of the live outdoor art installation - 'Computational Convergence' at India Art Fair, held from 9-12 February 2023 in New Delhi.\n\nTo flow is to expand and contract with the waves within. A tangled chaos of particles is unhindered with a deep breath and relaxation. With permission to flow, patterns emerge.\n\nTo meditate with this artwork:\n- keep your eyes moving slowly, trying not to fixate on a point.\n- when thoughts arise, gently let them go and return to the artwork.\n- bring your awareness again, to the act of seeing moment by moment.\n\nFlow might arise in many ways- turbulent, synchronous, circular, ephemeral, convergent, divergent, rising, waning or a mix of any of these.\n\n[GPU-intensive, Best viewed @ 4k/full-screen.

            "description": "Mountains throughout human history have taken on deep meanings. Coated with immense sacredness by all peoples in the most different places. Being them as a representation of God himself or being the object of worship. For many the mountains were the very abode of the Gods. They are in the collective unconscious as the ability to connect men and gods, through the flow of energy between earth and heaven.\n\nThe symbology is very strong. It unconsciously reminds us of the process of encounter between the loneliness of the earth and the hope of the sky, between the fog that blinds and the cloud that supports, between the abyss of the ground and the proximity of the stars. All this is very charming and fascinating.\n\nAll human beings have their own mountain, which demands from each one their limits to reach the top, the desire for the breathtaking view, the fear of falling, but also the hope of the last step at the highest point.\n\nIn generative art it couldn't be different, going through all the learning, from its fundamentals, to all the countless hours of tests, to countless moments of problem solving and research and more research. This whole process is without a doubt like climbing a mountain. Thinking about the project is exactly like looking at a mountain and imagining how exhausting it will be all the way to conquer it. Finishing your work is like breathing a sigh of relief, looking down and seeing how hard it was to get there, but at the same time looking ahead and realizing how rewarding it was to be able to have that vision and breathe the refreshing breeze of the moment.\n\nAfter going through a transformation in my first work, where I transmuted my artistic essence from illustration to generative art. Now I come to this second work that I delved into, and after months of climbing this mountain of mine, I give it to you.\n\n\n- Press \"S\" in live view mode after loading to save at 1600x1600px.\n\nlicense: \nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nproject website:\nhttps://playman.me/projectmountain\n",
