We learn what is acceptable and what is not. Our thoughts are forced to align with the structure imposed upon us.\n\nScaffold is an attempt to visually explore this concept of thoughts and control. Each output represents a state of mind at a particular moment in time.\n\nPalettes have been mostly named by my family based on the first word they thought of when they saw them.\n\nKeyboard commands:\n\ns - save as png\nh - toggle high resolution‚Ä®\nb - toggle background texture\na - switch aspect ratio\nr - new moment",

Outputs are made up of arrangements of squares in various compositions, yet within that we are free to imagine what they could mean. For some, the resulting shapes might represent DNA strands or atoms. Others might see cells or the building blocks of the hereditary instructions that shape us as individuals. \n\nA generative genetic report accompanies each output to spark the imagination and attempt to attach further meaning to each composition. Some gene sequences carry mutations, however not all mutations are visually apparent. Please refer to the fxhash features to view the reports accordingly.\n\nTexture is used subtly, so for maximum enjoyment it is recommended that you save and view your outputs at full size in order to best enjoy the details.\n\nPress 'S' to save a 2400 x 3396 px PNG file.",

Outputs are made up of arrangements of squares in various compositions, yet within that we are free to imagine what they could mean. For some, the resulting shapes might represent DNA strands or atoms. Others might see cells or the building blocks of the hereditary instructions that shape us as individuals. \n\nA generative genetic report accompanies each output to spark the imagination and attempt to attach further meaning to each composition. Some gene sequences carry mutations, however not all mutations are visually apparent. Please refer to the fxhash features to view the reports accordingly.\n\nTexture is used subtly, so for maximum enjoyment it is recommended that you save and view your outputs at full size in order to best enjoy the details.\n\nPress 'S' to save a 2400 x 3396 px PNG file.",

            "description": "Waves and Ripples is an implementation of a continuous CA, where wave like behaviours are obtained from the influence of neighbour cells over the cell itself. Depeding on the connections config for each cell, different patterns will emerge, creating waves, ripples, or a mix of both. When single loop is on, the calculations and drawings are done at once, which makes for a more chaotic visual.\nBest enjoyed in full-screen :) \n\nClick anywhere to restart\n\nFeatures : \n  shrinkFactor : 3 types\n  connectArray: 16 possibilities,\n  extraConnection: 4 types,\n  mutualNeighbour: 40% chance,\n  singleLoop: 30% chance\n  monoChromo:  15% chance\n\nInspired by Matt Pearson's book.",

            "description": "How and How Not To Maintain Friendships charts the ways that relationships between people can develop or dissipate over time. Starting from different places, and different degrees of distance or closeness, friendships evolve over time. Sometimes we grow closer to others, sometimes we grow apart. Sometimes this happens quickly, and other times it is slow. Sometimes we become so enmeshed in our friends‚Äôs lives that our paths twist together, interlocking and criss-crossing in a shared journey. Other times we may follow mostly parallel paths with a handful of others, some of whom may head off on their own paths at different points down the line. Each of us influences the many people around us in different ways. Like masses suspended in space, friendship works like gravity on the people close to us, sometimes bringing us closer together and sometimes sending us whirling off in new directions.\n\n2022 by LIA (www.liaworks.com)\n\nToken-holder's usage rights:\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

For some, the resulting shapes might represent DNA strands or atoms. Others might see cells or the building blocks of the hereditary instructions that shape us as individuals. \n\nA generative genetic report accompanies each output to spark the imagination and attempt to attach further meaning to each composition.

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works ‚Äì focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other‚Äôs work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them ‚Äì especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra‚Äôs use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work ‚Äì especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra‚Äôs compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me ‚ÄúMe as you ‚Äù (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor ‚ÄúMe as you as me‚Äù I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach‚Äôs work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, ‚ÄúMe as Me‚Äù has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh ‚Äìis it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave ‚Äì is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  ‚Äì\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes ‚Äì\nPress ‚Äúh‚Äù to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press ‚Äúm‚Äù to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and ‚Äúl‚Äù to reduce it. Use ‚Äús‚Äù to save the current resolution. \n\n",

Outputs are made up of arrangements of squares in various compositions, yet within that we are free to imagine what they could mean. For some, the resulting shapes might represent DNA strands or atoms. Others might see cells or the building blocks of the hereditary instructions that shape us as individuals. \n\nA generative genetic report accompanies each output to spark the imagination and attempt to attach further meaning to each composition. Some gene sequences carry mutations, however not all mutations are visually apparent. Please refer to the fxhash features to view the reports accordingly.\n\nTexture is used subtly, so for maximum enjoyment it is recommended that you save and view your outputs at full size in order to best enjoy the details.\n\nPress 'S' to save a 2400 x 3396 px PNG file.",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press ‚Äúe‚Äù to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press ‚Äúr‚Äù. Which one is the ‚Äúfinished‚Äù artwork? All of them. What is ‚Äúthe‚Äù artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: ‚Äúe‚Äù. To restore: ‚Äúr‚Äù\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing ‚Äúp‚Äù\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing ‚Äús‚Äù (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing ‚Äúd‚Äù followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press ‚Äúd 0‚Äù (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don‚Äôt know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press ‚Äúq‚Äù\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press ‚Äúv‚Äù followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press ‚Äúv‚Äù followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing ‚Äúo‚Äù. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr√≠guez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "Cellular Automata are one of the oldest and simplest classes of generative systems. Beginning with the highly abstracted, reductionist models of artificial life research by Stanislav Ulam and John von Neumann in the 1940s, Barricelli in the early 1950s, then re-discovered, formalized, expanded and popularized by other mathematicians like Conway and Wolfram 20-30 years later, it's a long-running field of research, rich with unexpected surprises and new discoveries. C-SCAPE is (a partial) result of over 20 years of my own explorations and a celebration of these simple systems.\n\nMost of my purely generative work has been about creating and harnessing emergent complexity & nonrepetitve, ever-changing behaviors (and their interactions) borne from extremely simple systems, mechanisms, algorithms & languages: Exposing, investigating (and yes, celebrating) generativity in its raw form. By minimizing, though not entirely avoiding, additional human aesthetic decision making (here primarily in the form of curating automata rules & color themes), I'm trying to focus the observer on the raw beauty of the underlying processes and bring it to the fore. My hope is, this too will lead viewers asking themselves the deeper questions about the nature of rules, behavior, order and complexity in their own lives, esp. in the current rising polarizing political & anti-science climate. Furthermore, I'd like to provide a counter point and emphasize the unique qualities of generative art, compared to other, more figurative and abstract art approaches.\n\nC-SCAPE simulates a shared toroidal environment in which multiple cellular automata (CA) are evolving and influencing each other, forming short-lived symbioses and/or wiping each other out, only to be restored again later on. The automata are all operating on a single row of pixels at a time and therefore are only 1-dimensional. Yet, many of them also have a short term memory and can produce more complex structures/behaviors by utilizing their memory of previous cell states. Each individually minted version produces a unique system which evolves over time and never repeats.\n\nThe final selection of CA rules used in this piece is the result of many years of experimentation with 100,000s of different configurations and many (manual) review/pruning/cataloging sessions to encourage the minted editions to cover a interesting & balanced subset of the more than duodecillion (10^39) possible individual structures & textures (not including interactions and/or color variations)...\n\nViewing\n\nThe piece in best viewed in medium/high resolution landscape format. The horizontal resolution should be at the very least 800 pixels, preferably double that or higher. There's a max. pixel resolution limit of 4096 pixels in either direction, but CPU performance might suffer at these resolutions. On narrow/mobile portrait ratios the piece will be shown 90 degrees rotated and is scrolling sideways.\n\nControls\n\n- x : export current frame\n- r : randomize environment\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and thi.ng",

Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ‚ù§Ô∏è, code and p5js.",
