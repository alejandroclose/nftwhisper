The idea is to take previous works and reconvert them or give me the freedom to play with the algorithms and explore new options and parameters to reach their limits or to obtain something different but with the same essence.\n\nThe CR Art Sessions //1 is based on my first fx(hash) project called Geoetris. \n\nThe same algorithm was slightly modified to produce 3 different types of art that the user will be able to visualize. \n1. The first type is an extreme version of the Geoetris project, where the parameters were modified to have blend between the pieces and generate many more elements on screen. \n2. The second is a composition of circles and squares, where there is a very simple rule that can only sometimes be broken and that is that the rectangles start in the middle of the circle. \n3. The third is a version where the larger geometric shapes are not filled and only their silhouette is marked.\n\n-----\n\nReserves: All 'Geoetris' owners and 40-40 slots for 'Yo automata' and 'Isomeric Doppelgangers' owners\n\n-----\n\nRoyalties: 50% to minter\n\n-----\n\nControls:\n\nExplore each art variant with the '1', '2', '3' keys\n\nThe 'e' key exports the current canvas\n\nThe 's' key exports the image in 3200x4000 px resolution\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2022)\n\nMade with P5js and <3.",

            "description": "\n\n\n\nIn Argentina there is a very young and talented music producer called BIZARRAP.\n\nHe is very famous for the BZRP Music Sessions, which are tracks in collaboration with international artists that Bizarrap produces in his studio, which also serves as a recording studio for the official video clip of the track.\n\nIn these sessions the artists have the freedom to express themselves in ways that perhaps the industry doesn't allow them because they have an image to sell, or the freedom to deliver whatever they want.\n\nFor example, in the Music Session with Nicky Jam, the Puerto Rican artist sings rap in Spanish, English and reggaeton, all in the same song.\n\nInspired by this concept I decided to launch my CR Art Sessions format. The idea is to take previous works and reconvert them or give me the freedom to play with the algorithms and explore new options and parameters to reach their limits or to obtain something different but with the same essence.\n\nThe CR Art Sessions //1 is based on my first fx(hash) project called Geoetris. \n\nThe same algorithm was slightly modified to produce 3 different types of art that the user will be able to visualize. \n1. The first type is an extreme version of the Geoetris project, where the parameters were modified to have blend between the pieces and generate many more elements on screen. \n2. The second is a composition of circles and squares, where there is a very simple rule that can only sometimes be broken and that is that the rectangles start in the middle of the circle. \n3. The third is a version where the larger geometric shapes are not filled and only their silhouette is marked.\n\n-----\n\nReserves: All 'Geoetris' owners and 40-40 slots for 'Yo automata' and 'Isomeric Doppelgangers' owners\n\n-----\n\nRoyalties: 50% to minter\n\n-----\n\nControls:\n\nExplore each art variant with the '1', '2', '3' keys\n\nThe 'e' key exports the current canvas\n\nThe 's' key exports the image in 3200x4000 px resolution\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2022)\n\nMade with P5js and <3.",

Working off the same physics engine, I aimed to create something more expressive, experimenting with new approaches to brushes, and using those new brushes to create new tones from the same palette as Bedlam. I've also removed the limit for the background, so the work can in turn be more colorful, and wont be limited to what can be created on \"traditional\" canvas colors. The canvas is now 8x10 to allow for easy printing of the piece if you choose to display it on your wall :)\n\nThere are three brush styles (Origami, Floral, and Pop), four stroke modes (ranging from meandering to curvy to jagged), two splatter types (triangular or round), and 25 color palettes, which means there are 100 possible background colors.\n\nPress 's' when in live mode to save a .png\n",

            "description": "\n\n\n\nIn Argentina there is a very young and talented music producer called BIZARRAP.\n\nHe is very famous for the BZRP Music Sessions, which are tracks in collaboration with international artists that Bizarrap produces in his studio, which also serves as a recording studio for the official video clip of the track.\n\nIn these sessions the artists have the freedom to express themselves in ways that perhaps the industry doesn't allow them because they have an image to sell, or the freedom to deliver whatever they want.\n\nFor example, in the Music Session with Nicky Jam, the Puerto Rican artist sings rap in Spanish, English and reggaeton, all in the same song.\n\nInspired by this concept I decided to launch my CR Art Sessions format. The idea is to take previous works and reconvert them or give me the freedom to play with the algorithms and explore new options and parameters to reach their limits or to obtain something different but with the same essence.\n\nThe CR Art Sessions //1 is based on my first fx(hash) project called Geoetris. \n\nThe same algorithm was slightly modified to produce 3 different types of art that the user will be able to visualize. \n1. The first type is an extreme version of the Geoetris project, where the parameters were modified to have blend between the pieces and generate many more elements on screen. \n2. The second is a composition of circles and squares, where there is a very simple rule that can only sometimes be broken and that is that the rectangles start in the middle of the circle. \n3. The third is a version where the larger geometric shapes are not filled and only their silhouette is marked.\n\n-----\n\nReserves: All 'Geoetris' owners and 40-40 slots for 'Yo automata' and 'Isomeric Doppelgangers' owners\n\n-----\n\nRoyalties: 50% to minter\n\n-----\n\nControls:\n\nExplore each art variant with the '1', '2', '3' keys\n\nThe 'e' key exports the current canvas\n\nThe 's' key exports the image in 3200x4000 px resolution\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2022)\n\nMade with P5js and <3.",
