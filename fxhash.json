Contact me via twitter if you want a super hi-res file. \n\nCopyright pixelwank 2022.\nMade with love and p5js \n\nThanks for collecting!\nBig shoutout to the Circolors fam. Don't worry something's cooking <3 \n\nRemember. It's. For. Fun.\nR.I.F.F. \n<3",

            "description": "GuilCity is the beginning of an exciting journey bringing Guillaume Cornet’s densely-packed cities into the generative realm with the help of Matthew’s (@frostbitten’s) magic touch.\n\nMatthew—with his background in coding and animation—enables a new opportunity to experience these cities like never before. Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey! \n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you’ve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n—\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n—\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n• https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n—\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others’ skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci à tous! Cheers!\n  - Guillaume Cornet, Matthew Seremet",

Boom_fx is a visual interpretation of ten of these days through the lens of real world earthquake data and the colour palettes of Mark Rothko.\n\nEach iteration of Boom_fx represents a window of time on one of these days and expresses the seismic activity that occurred.\n\nThese are creative interpretations and while the visual elements and relationships between objects are all based on detailed seismic data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), they are not meant to be understood as maps.\n\nThe ten days were selected for having some significance to the growth and evolution of the fxhash platform and Tezos more broadly.\n\nIn chronological order:\n\n1. September 2, 2014 - Tezos White paper released\n2. June 30, 2018 - Tezos Initial Release\n3. November 6, 2021- Genesis drop on fxhash\n4. November 7, 2021 - ciphrd's and punevyr's first drops\n5.

This is the last full day of USGS Earthquake data before Boom_fx is published to fxhash.xyz. This date doesn't represent a milestone for the platform, it simply conveys a milestone for the work itself.\n\nThe earthquake data comes from the USGS API which very handily provides GeoJSON files. There is further documentation (./documentation/Information_about_boom_fx.md) included with this project that outlines how this data was collected and the information included in these feeds.\n\nFeatures\n--- \n1. Aspect ratios:\n- Landscape 62% probability\n- Portrait 24% probability\n- Square 14% probability\n\n2. Colour Palettes\nEleven Mark Rothko palettes. All equally probable.\n\n3. Date\nEach of the eleven days included in this project have an equal probability of being selected.\n\n4. Concurrent minutes sampled during this day\nThere are six different durations used in this project and they all have an equal probability of being selected.\n\nInteraction\n---\nExport to a PNG format at several different sizes.\n- Press t: thumbnail @ a maximum pixel width or height of 200px\n- Press s: your current screen size\n- Press p: print size @ a maximum pixel width or height of 4800px which is 16\"@300dpi\n- Press h: HD4K on the vertical @ a maximum pixel width or height of 2160px\n- Press m: Max size @ a maximum pixel width or height of 10800px.

            "description": "This collection takes its main inspiration from the Turkish marbling art “Ebru” and tries to spin it with a golden twist, hence alchemy :) \n\nalchemy(maxima) tries to create a composition either using one of the two grid types, and sometimes breaking them or in a totally chaotic way, but uses color harmony and rhythm to keep the chaos in check and the resulting image still somewhat interesting and sometimes golden-ish…\n\nThe name includes “maxima” because this is the first part of a 2-part series; its companion collection “alchemy(minima)” will be released soon and as per my tradition will be freely available to maxima holders.\n\nFrom the proceeds of the primary sales of alchemy(maxima),\n\n- 33% will directly go to The Processing Foundation,\n- 33% will fund the greater evil,\n- 34% will be used to grow my collection.\n\nSo in a way, all the proceeds will go back into the ecosystem. This is my way of making up for taking tez out with my donations earlier.\n\nIf you are wondering what the hell “the greater evil” is, read about it here : \n\nhttps://twitter.com/evilnft/status/1544320804304961536?s=20&t=AoEfLfn32tGNR8JTi5Jjng\n\nAnd find it here:\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/the%20greater%20evil/collection\n\n—\n\nAbout the work: \n\n- 22 palettes - 7 new, 15 recycled,\n- 3 main variants,\n- 4 sub-variants each,\n- 9 visible and some hidden features :)\n- After going live, press “s” to save a png (at your screen resolution)\n- No hi-res output due to the warp manipulating the pixel array directly, which means higher res equals to much higher computation time.\n\nThank you all in advance and have a good day!\n\nWarp functions are based on this article by Inigo Quilez : https://iquilezles.org/articles/warp/\n\nDISCLAIMER : I am not a good coder, I have tried to fix my past mistakes from my earlier projects to make some room for new mistakes :) I am learning on the way and certainly hoping that there aren't any huge bugs or anything, so you can enjoy your mint! Please hit me up if you have any concerns after minting and we can discuss a solution.\n",

Data was collected in GeoJSON format from the following endpoint: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/\n\nSoftware Libraries Used\nMade with Processing / P5.js  \np5.js v1.4.1 February 02, 2022\n\nVersion Control\nhttps://github.com/sspboyd/boom\nThis repo is private as of July 2022. However, I have provided a source map with this project so please feel free to browse the code and see how it all works. There are a number of comments in the code explaining what is happening at different points.\n\n\nLicense info\n---\nSee LICENSE.md\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons  \nAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License  \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nNFT Art and Code copyright by Stephen Boyd\n\n\nContact Info\n---\nFind me online @sspboyd.

Auction will stop changing price when non-reserves are fully minted.\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nNature’s wild flourish and untamed growth wondrously represent the exacting function of beauty — a function that is at once useful and infinitely creative. Perhaps nowhere is this delicate symbiosis better observed than in the flower, wherein a pure balance of physical fundamentals exists beneath ornate patterns and elaborate aesthetics.\n\nAmongst the layers of undulating, vividly colored petals, attention-grabbing stigma and stamen, and lusciously decorative features, nature’s organic abundance and disorder disguises its masterful propensity for precision. Each of the flower’s components evolve through unpredictable interactions with an unwieldy natural environment, creating spectacular adaptations that emerge from the tension between what attracts.\n\nRococo painters appreciated the organic fluidity found in flowers and vegetal forms, using their joyful abundance to depict a break from the rigid and stoic period the artists hoped to leave behind. They sought to reframe perfection away from predictability and toward compositions as surprising as the natural world around them.\n\nThus, ‘Rococo’ is a generative distortion of an old tradition: a digital painting created entirely with code that interprets and processes the natural world’s dichotomies. This painting algorithm builds upon natural structures while melding and moving their colors beyond form, growing randomly organic iterations that are as perfect as they are imperfect.\n\nCreated by Ori Ben-Shabat & Ronen Tanchum @Phenomenalabs\nCreative contributions from Tender @tender_art\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nTechnical Details:\n\n- Mobile/GPU Intensive\n- Press “s” to save a .png of the artwork in live view\n- Press “p” to render a high res output + press “s” to save a printable .png",

            "description": "Boom_fx, by Stephen Boyd  \nJuly, 2022  \nLittle India, Toronto, Canada.\n\nProject Description\n---\nDuring the short history of fxhash, there have been several important dates marking the growth and evolution of the platform. Boom_fx is a visual interpretation of ten of these days through the lens of real world earthquake data and the colour palettes of Mark Rothko.\n\nEach iteration of Boom_fx represents a window of time on one of these days and expresses the seismic activity that occurred.\n\nThese are creative interpretations and while the visual elements and relationships between objects are all based on detailed seismic data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), they are not meant to be understood as maps.\n\nThe ten days were selected for having some significance to the growth and evolution of the fxhash platform and Tezos more broadly.\n\nIn chronological order:\n\n1. September 2, 2014 - Tezos White paper released\n2. June 30, 2018 - Tezos Initial Release\n3. November 6, 2021- Genesis drop on fxhash\n4. November 7, 2021 - ciphrd's and punevyr's first drops\n5. November 11, 2021 - markknol drops 'SMOLSKULL'\n6. December 9, 2021 - zancan drops 'Garden, Monoliths'\n7. January 2, 2022 - E0 \"The Genesis Drop\" of Waiting to be Signed podcast'\n8. March 31, 2022 - The Big Burn\n9. April 16, 2022 - fxhash 1.0 release\n10. March 27, 2022 - Opening day of Art Basel Hong Kong, 2022\n\nThere is an eleventh day included: July 18, 2022. This is the last full day of USGS Earthquake data before Boom_fx is published to fxhash.xyz. This date doesn't represent a milestone for the platform, it simply conveys a milestone for the work itself.\n\nThe earthquake data comes from the USGS API which very handily provides GeoJSON files. There is further documentation (./documentation/Information_about_boom_fx.md) included with this project that outlines how this data was collected and the information included in these feeds.\n\nFeatures\n--- \n1. Aspect ratios:\n- Landscape 62% probability\n- Portrait 24% probability\n- Square 14% probability\n\n2. Colour Palettes\nEleven Mark Rothko palettes. All equally probable.\n\n3. Date\nEach of the eleven days included in this project have an equal probability of being selected.\n\n4. Concurrent minutes sampled during this day\nThere are six different durations used in this project and they all have an equal probability of being selected.\n\nInteraction\n---\nExport to a PNG format at several different sizes.\n- Press t: thumbnail @ a maximum pixel width or height of 200px\n- Press s: your current screen size\n- Press p: print size @ a maximum pixel width or height of 4800px which is 16\"@300dpi\n- Press h: HD4K on the vertical @ a maximum pixel width or height of 2160px\n- Press m: Max size @ a maximum pixel width or height of 10800px. This is a biiiig size\n\nThe filename will include some metadata such as the unique hash, date and time at time of capture.\n\nData Sources, Software Libraries and VCS / Source Code\n--- \n\nData Sources\nAll earthquake data is sourced from the USGS Earthquake API for the International Federation of Digital Seismograph Networks (FDSN). Data was collected in GeoJSON format from the following endpoint: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/\n\nSoftware Libraries Used\nMade with Processing / P5.js  \np5.js v1.4.1 February 02, 2022\n\nVersion Control\nhttps://github.com/sspboyd/boom\nThis repo is private as of July 2022. However, I have provided a source map with this project so please feel free to browse the code and see how it all works. There are a number of comments in the code explaining what is happening at different points.\n\n\nLicense info\n---\nSee LICENSE.md\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons  \nAttribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License  \nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nNFT Art and Code copyright by Stephen Boyd\n\n\nContact Info\n---\nFind me online @sspboyd.

            "description": "This collection takes its main inspiration from the Turkish marbling art “Ebru” and tries to spin it with a golden twist, hence alchemy :) \n\nalchemy(maxima) tries to create a composition either using one of the two grid types, and sometimes breaking them or in a totally chaotic way, but uses color harmony and rhythm to keep the chaos in check and the resulting image still somewhat interesting and sometimes golden-ish…\n\nThe name includes “maxima” because this is the first part of a 2-part series; its companion collection “alchemy(minima)” will be released soon and as per my tradition will be freely available to maxima holders.\n\nFrom the proceeds of the primary sales of alchemy(maxima),\n\n- 33% will directly go to The Processing Foundation,\n- 33% will fund the greater evil,\n- 34% will be used to grow my collection.\n\nSo in a way, all the proceeds will go back into the ecosystem. This is my way of making up for taking tez out with my donations earlier.\n\nIf you are wondering what the hell “the greater evil” is, read about it here : \n\nhttps://twitter.com/evilnft/status/1544320804304961536?s=20&t=AoEfLfn32tGNR8JTi5Jjng\n\nAnd find it here:\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/the%20greater%20evil/collection\n\n—\n\nAbout the work: \n\n- 22 palettes - 7 new, 15 recycled,\n- 3 main variants,\n- 4 sub-variants each,\n- 9 visible and some hidden features :)\n- After going live, press “s” to save a png (at your screen resolution)\n- No hi-res output due to the warp manipulating the pixel array directly, which means higher res equals to much higher computation time.\n\nThank you all in advance and have a good day!\n\nWarp functions are based on this article by Inigo Quilez : https://iquilezles.org/articles/warp/\n\nDISCLAIMER : I am not a good coder, I have tried to fix my past mistakes from my earlier projects to make some room for new mistakes :) I am learning on the way and certainly hoping that there aren't any huge bugs or anything, so you can enjoy your mint! Please hit me up if you have any concerns after minting and we can discuss a solution.\n",

            "description": "This collection takes its main inspiration from the Turkish marbling art “Ebru” and tries to spin it with a golden twist, hence alchemy :) \n\nalchemy(maxima) tries to create a composition either using one of the two grid types, and sometimes breaking them or in a totally chaotic way, but uses color harmony and rhythm to keep the chaos in check and the resulting image still somewhat interesting and sometimes golden-ish…\n\nThe name includes “maxima” because this is the first part of a 2-part series; its companion collection “alchemy(minima)” will be released soon and as per my tradition will be freely available to maxima holders.\n\nFrom the proceeds of the primary sales of alchemy(maxima),\n\n- 33% will directly go to The Processing Foundation,\n- 33% will fund the greater evil,\n- 34% will be used to grow my collection.\n\nSo in a way, all the proceeds will go back into the ecosystem. This is my way of making up for taking tez out with my donations earlier.\n\nIf you are wondering what the hell “the greater evil” is, read about it here : \n\nhttps://twitter.com/evilnft/status/1544320804304961536?s=20&t=AoEfLfn32tGNR8JTi5Jjng\n\nAnd find it here:\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/the%20greater%20evil/collection\n\n—\n\nAbout the work: \n\n- 22 palettes - 7 new, 15 recycled,\n- 3 main variants,\n- 4 sub-variants each,\n- 9 visible and some hidden features :)\n- After going live, press “s” to save a png (at your screen resolution)\n- No hi-res output due to the warp manipulating the pixel array directly, which means higher res equals to much higher computation time.\n\nThank you all in advance and have a good day!\n\nWarp functions are based on this article by Inigo Quilez : https://iquilezles.org/articles/warp/\n\nDISCLAIMER : I am not a good coder, I have tried to fix my past mistakes from my earlier projects to make some room for new mistakes :) I am learning on the way and certainly hoping that there aren't any huge bugs or anything, so you can enjoy your mint! Please hit me up if you have any concerns after minting and we can discuss a solution.\n",
