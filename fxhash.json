As is usual with such things, it quickly took on a life of its own. \n\nThe algorithm itself consists of three layers of the main particle abstraction, which comes in five different styles, and roughly eight layers of the \"texture,\" which comes in three styles. The palette consists of the background color and three colors for the particle algorithm. The texture is always drawn with the first of those three colors (the \"base\" color.) \n\nThe result is indicative of my normal painting style (I almost always use three color layers over a background color, and paint with a spatula, palette knife, or cake knife) but is its own unique look.

            "description": "\"a formless beauty\" continues my exploration of pure abstract generative art. \n\nIn this piece, I begin with a white field. An abstract pattern of rectangles are drawn on this field, using one of 12 different color palettes. On top of this, a white diamond or filled circle is drawn, and then marks (the term that IRL abstract painters will be familiar with) are drawn over the top of this. These three layers comprise the basis of the piece. \n\nThings are fairly deterministic so far, but this juncture, a large amount of randomness is introduced to the piece, as the image is passed through a fragment shader that applies fractal noise to the process, resulting in an image that appears to have been painted and then washed out. I would like to thank Melissa Wiederrecht for the inspiration in this regard; her Zbageti piece pushed me to explore shaders and their effect on the overall look of the piece. \n\nNote 1: Due to the nature of WebGL, this piece may not (probably will not) run in live mode on a mobile device. I've tested it on mobile Safari and mobile Chrome, and it will run sometimes, but the device is very unhappy with it. \n\nNote 2: Due to the nature of fractal noise and the preview engine in FxHash, the preview image will  be slightly different than the live view. It will give you a general idea of the piece, but the live view will be more vibrant and detailed.\n\nNote 3: In Live view, press \"s\" to save a 4000x4000 PNG of the image to your system. ",

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "The concept of organic, obtained from living systems, is said to be an effect that, like a plant and a living being, has grown in a completely dynamic manner in different degrees, and no factor except vital forces has prevented its growth. Organic creation is an example of this type. Léonard de Vinci believed in nature; he wrote, \"Painting is a child of nature\" in his opinion, art should be compatible with nature. His public image of creativity was \"innovation while maintaining fidelity\" to nature. According to Michelangelo, the form the artist gives to the materials is in the artist's mind and the materials themselves. Therefore, the artist is always in a metaphysical struggle with the form and secrets of nature. This is a revelatory process through which the artist discovers the mass of paper already hidden in his mind and the materials. As an architect, I tried to create this work while paying attention to the structuralism of shapes and forms in creation, inspired by the colors in nature and my experience in painting and illustration.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of royalty on each secondary sale.\nEighteen different color palettes and three different borders are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated August 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

In plain view, these knots invite us to contemplate what our bonds mean to us, and to see them anew.\n\n---\n\nPress ‘1’-’9’ to increase resolution\nPress 's' to save an image of the output at the current resolution\n\nCreated with p5.js\nFor third party license information, please see license.md\n\n---\n\nTENDER x David Brice Allen\nJuly 2022",

As an architect, I tried to create this work while paying attention to the structuralism of shapes and forms in creation, inspired by the colors in nature and my experience in painting and illustration.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of royalty on each secondary sale.\nEighteen different color palettes and three different borders are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated August 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "The first blueprint was found in 1947 on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.\nIt has been studied several times.\nNumerous theories arose trying to explain its origin.\nNone of them was decided conclusively.\n\nOne year ago, a rare group of waves coming from space was intercepted on earth.\nThis happened during the 2021 summer.\nIt was unclear if they were born from natural events.\nDying stars, black holes... Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n—--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n—--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n—--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022.

            "description": "Let me take you places. Those are not in your town, not even on your planet. They’re placed somewhere between reality and subconsciousness.\nEnormous, peculiar structures emerge upon you, refusing to be ignored. They are your unfulfilled cravings or ever-lurking demons. They were always there, under your skin, intangible, now they’ve materialized.\nYou may not like them, they may seem too vast, too scary to tame. But ultimately, you have to face them, unless you enjoy living in their shadow. \n\n___\nInspirations\n\nI’ve never truly realized that, but ever since I remember, the sight of gigantic objects or creatures evoked strong emotions within me.\nIt probably started with playing Shadow of Colossus (a video game) as a kid and seeing The Cathedral (short movie by Tomasz Bagiński). Years later, reading Solaris (by Stanisław Lem) aroused the same feeling (among others) of being mesmerized by the vastness. More recently, movies like Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival (which also nudged my attraction to mystery) and Dune - have charmed me.\n\nEarlier this year I have stumbled across Dawid Planeta (artist and yoga teacher) and began contemplating his visions of mini people in the jungle inhabited by giant animals. These works in particular, plus Hollow - generative series by Jacek Markusiewicz - were probably my final inspirations to make Intangible look the way it does.\n\nSettling semi-random generative structures in some kind of reality, gave them a meaning - they may symbolize things much bigger than you - the ones you try to escape from or those you’ve been longing to experience for years. I have mine, don’t you?\n\n___\nControls in live mode\n\n\nKeyboard\n[ space ] - toggle light animation\n[ S ] - save image with current size (default is 120% of browser window’s height; you may change browser’s scale or check URL size param)\n[ F ] - fullscreen \n[ up / down ] - light intensity\n[ left / right ] - base light position\n[ 1..5 ] - aspect ratio: 10:16 („zero” ratio), 1:1.4142 (vertical A4), 1:1, 1.4142 (horizontal A4), 16:10\n[ B ] - toggle border\n[ Z ] - toggle canvas „raw” mode - no shadow / margin (auto applied in fullscreen mode)\n[ N ] - toggle „that thing you may not want on print”\n\n\nURL params\nYou may add any number of parameters to the URL to start it with particular settings. \n[ animate ] (1/0) - toggle light animation\n[ size] (number) - number of px for longer edge, i.e. 4000\n[ ratio ] (number or ratio with format: 10/16, 10:16, 10_16) - aspect ratio\n[ light ] (number 40..120, some palettes have slightly different limits for good results) - light intensity\n[ lightShift] (number -100..100) - base light position\n[ border ] (1/0) - toggle border\n[ hddcy ] (0/1)\n\nExample: [ &size=4000&border=1&light=100&animate=1 ] \n\n\nMobile\n[hold 2 fingers for 2s] - save\n[double tap] - fullscreen\n\n\n___\nNote:\nI encourage you to do some light adjustments before you save an image for print. I’m pretty sure you can do better than fxrand().\n\n\n___\nSpecial thanks to my brother Krzycho, for lots of advices / heathy criticism and to Olga, for never-ending excitement and „dorady”.\n\n___\nDeveloped in Javascript, using p5.js (2D Canvas) and chroma.js.\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n© April-July 2022, MadeUpLifeforms (mulf)\n",

            "description": "I do not know which to prefer,\nThe beauty of inflections\nOr the beauty of innuendoes,\nThe blackbird whistling\nOr just after.\n\n  Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird\n  Wallace Stevens\n\nHarmonium began as an algorithmic exploration of space filling and curve placement, and grew into a study of the many ways that forms can coexist in a space.\n\nThere are three stages to the rendering process:\n1. Initial drawing with a placeholder color assignment algorithm\n2. Analysis and final color assignment\n3. Streamline tapering and conversion to SVG\n\nThe final step will typically cause the image to look darker than the previous steps due to the tapering of the streamlines and the vector nature of SVG. I recommend viewing Harmonium outputs on the largest screen you have available.\n\nThe final SVG version of the image can be exported by pressing the 'e' key.\n\n*Plotting*\n\nYou can disable/enable streamline tapering by pressing the 't' key. Un-tapered exports are intended for plotting on your favorite pen plotter, and include several Inkscape-compatible layer definitions to make plotting different colors possible. (Be sure to disable the background layer.)\n\nThe SVG has no dimensions defined so you will need to set the paper dimensions by adjusting the SVG as needed. I will provide additional detail on how to do this in an upcoming blog post. (The short version is to change the page dimensions in Inkscape and set the viewbox width and height to 1.0.)\n\njpalmer.dev\n@jeffpalmer",
