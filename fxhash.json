I initially envisioned vines growing on buildings, but over time Intertwined moved in a more abstract embroidery-like direction while retaining influences from that foundational concept.\n\nControls:\nKey S: Save the output as a jpeg at the current resolution (only available once the piece has finished loading).\nKey Arrow Up: Scale the resolution up by a multiple of 1080 pixels. There is no maximum. The current highest recommended scale-factor is 4x.\nKey Arrow Down: Scale the resolution down by a multiple of 1080 pixels. 1080p is the minimum.\nKey A: Skip the construction animation to show the final result immediately (please note that for pieces with a larger grid skipping the animation may cause a long pause).\n\nBrowser Support: Confirmed to work in Chrome Version 97.0.4692.71",

            "description": "SCHNEEWALD is the second release in a row of about 12 tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years.\n\nThis project explores an approach to trees with snow using a recursive algorithm and includes Three traits: a density layer for the amount of trees and another layer for the amount snow and a third for how strong the branches bend.\n\nRendering progress indicated on the top left border\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png\n\nArtist notes:\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nI experienced it in all sorts of seasonal change, packed with snow is definitely among the most amazing! \n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: https://e-art.co/project/schneewald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright Â© 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND",

            "description": "'Here When You Need Me' is a generative system that creates...\n\nGood question, and I think the answer is up to you. Jewels? Reflections? The Sand in a Life's Hourglass?\n\nWho knows. The truth is that I didn't have anything in mind for the project, and where it has ended up was purely through exploration, and a refinement of simple methods.\n\nBy the end, it has become exactly what I needed it to be, and the results of this project give me an encouragement that is difficult to explain.\n\nNow, one of the primary features of the project is your ability to make it what you need. Several URL arguments are explained below that will allow you to tweak your edition's distortion and resolution.\n\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Girls Who Code'\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n\n10% of royalties will go to 'Girls Who Code'\n10% of royalties will go to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n10% of royalties will go to the original minter\n\nThank you everyone.\n\n\nOptions\n-------\nParameters can be appended to the live URL to adjust the output's distortion, resolution, border size, and border color. These are all fun to play with, and can be used in combination to showcase the variability and potential of each piece.\n\n'&distortion=#': Adjust distortion, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 to see a 'flat' version of the image)\n'&resolution=#': Multiplier for width/height, any value from 0.1 to 6.0 (Soft max of 3.9)\n'&borderSize=#': Multiplier for border size, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 for no border)\n'&borderColor=ffffff': Custom border color, any 6 character hex code (Do not include '#')\n\nAn example of using multiple options would be '&resolution=2&distortion=.5'\n\nPlease check the linked fx(text) article for detailed examples on using these options.\n\n\nDistortion\n----------\nI wanted to provide some amount of control to take advantage of the possibilities of generative art. 'Here When You Need Me' starts off at a certain point, but allows you to adjust the distortion to your favorite level.\n\nUsing '&distortion=0' will show the underlying shapes.\n\n\nResolution / Printing\n---------------------\n'Here When You Need Me' looks best with at least '&resolution=2' and is designed to support printing. Remember that parameters can be provided to adjust the border attributes as well.\n\nIdeally, you should aim for 300 'pixels per inch' for a decent quality print. Default resolution is 1800x2400.\n\n'&resolution=1' -> 6\"x8\"\n'&resolution=2' -> 12\"x16\"\n\nSome quick math will give you the correct modifier if you start with the width in inches of your desired print. \n\n(inches) * (ppi) / (default width)\n\nAn important note, the maximum resolution modifier I've had success with is 3.9 because of the browser's image size limitations, but the capability is still in the code to go higher in case it is helpful to someone.\n\nIf you have your edition printed, please share with me because it would make me incredibly happy to see it!\n\n\n---------\nThank you to everyone for your support and contributions. \n\nI put way more detail in this description than I intended, but if you want even more, you can read about the development and potential of this project in the accompanying fx(text) article, once it is written.\n\nCreated by Walter Anderson (@noxiarb)",

There are different types of facades and roofs (roofs may or may not appear).\n\nI bring in this work some palettes that in some cases contrast strongly between their colors, while others have colors with less contrast, or are practically monochromatic. There are also two black and white palettes (which have a 20% chance of appearing if the time of day is 12am or 12pm).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nThis work does not have any png or similar, just code.\n\nConstrols in live mode:\nOn desktop: Press 's' to save as PNG (2000x2000)\nOn mobile: Touch the screen to save as PNG (2000x2000)\n\nArtwork created with p5.js and love.\nAugust-September 2022\n\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License",

            "description": "NEBELWALD is the first series of about 10 different tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years. \n\nThis project explores a minimalist approach to tree naturalism using a recursive algorithm and includes three traits: a density layer of fog, a measure of tree growth, and the softness of snowfall.\n\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png.\n\nArtist notes:\n\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nOnce I experienced it in a dense fog, which was amazing! beautiful and mysterious at the same time. This has definitely inspired the NEBELWALD work series.\n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: http://lumicon.de/e-art/project/nebelwald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright Â© 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND\n",

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. \nwww.tribute-hwf.com\n\nâOne criterion for art involves the process used by the artist for shaping the work. In the special case of mathematically supported fine art, the artmaking process occurs in a mathematically defined operation that allows the generation and transformation of images, methods used for picture processing.â - Herbert W. Franke\n\nI first came across Frankeâs âOrnamental Alphabetsâ in his book ðð°ð®ð±ð¶ðµð¦ð³ ðð³ð¢ð±ð©ðªð¤ð´ - ðð°ð®ð±ð¶ðµð¦ð³ ðð³ðµ, and was intrigued with the idea of using a simple letterform to explore different generative image processing techniques. \n\nIâve used letters and writing in my work for a long time, both with letterpress printing and in my asemic poetry programs. With asemic writing, I generate unrecognizable letters to reference text, and here I use recognizable letterforms removed from their typical function as language signifiers. \n\nMy goal with this project was to build as much texture and layering as possible by warping and collaging the letters together in various ways. The font Iâm using is a design I made years ago to supplement my wood type collection for printing. I really enjoyed being able to bring that part of my past work into my generative art practice. \n\nEach image is composed of the letters found in the hash for that piece, divided into either vowels or consonants. The program builds on a technique Iâve used before, where I generate an image to an off-screen canvas and then dive through the pixels to pull out the color and form I want to surface in the final image.\n\n25% of the primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke. These funds will be used by ZKM Karlsruhe to digitize Frankeâs 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any additional funds raised will be donated to the RÃ¼tgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n- Press âRâ to increase the pixel density and reload the image (this can be render intensive and will create a really large file suitable for printing)\n- Press âSâ to save a copy\n\nMade with p5js\nArtist: Sarah Ridgley\nOctober, 2022",

In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

Burroughs, which was later used by David Bowie to create some of his song lyrics.\n\nIt generates a sequential list of a few hundred words that are placed at random locations on the canvas without overlapping.\n\nUnder the hood, a home-built spatial subdivision algorithm is used to look for empty spaces where the next random word might fit.\n\nOriginally, the plan was to publish this work with categorized words that somehow fit together into a theme, but after playing around with it, I found that this didn't match the original idea of the cut-up technique.\nAlso, it was very interesting to see completely arbitrary and unrelated words close together, forming incomplete fragments of a possible sentence. Just use your imagination!\n\nThe list of words was created while thinking about the current situation in the world and reading the news. Note, however, that it may happen that some words close to each other form a strange combination.\n\nPress [S] to save in high resolution (long side = 4096 pixels).\n\nFeatures:\n\nFormat - Portrait 40%, Landscape 40%, Square 20%\nCanvas - Black 50%, White 50%\nBackground - Black 50%, White 50%\nPost-Effects - None 33%, Light 33%, Strong 33%\nColor Drop - Normal 50%, Inverse 50%\n\nmade with typescript and pixi.js\n\n\n2022 // Karuma\n",

            "description": "NEBELWALD is the first series of about 10 different tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years. \n\nThis project explores a minimalist approach to tree naturalism using a recursive algorithm and includes three traits: a density layer of fog, a measure of tree growth, and the softness of snowfall.\n\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png.\n\nArtist notes:\n\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nOnce I experienced it in a dense fog, which was amazing! beautiful and mysterious at the same time. This has definitely inspired the NEBELWALD work series.\n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: http://lumicon.de/e-art/project/nebelwald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright Â© 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND\n",

Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "Within each of us resides an evolutionary history of primal emotions, yet we often spend our lives dulling and controlling these instincts rather than reveling in them. Art is one of the ways we best express those instincts and intuitions â accessing and visualizing their visceral qualities, and releasing our deepest emotions in a way we can share.\n\npang reflects emotions that take control of our impulses â anguish, euphoria, obsession. By using crayon-like marks, the artworks convey the catharsis felt while drawing with a childlike abandon. To capture what gives such marks true feeling, the works deliberate the intrinsic movements, pressures, and angles shaped by hands in various moods. These qualities and their frenetic meanderings represent the infinite possibilities of where the crayon could go next â if only we could free ourselves from the layers of control we've built.\n\nThe contradictions we struggle with are reflected throughout the works:  in the long, methodical, and mathematical path to creation that yields work that looks fast, free and unrehearsed;  through the randomly-informed computer generation of art that feels human;  and by the depiction of long-standing traditional techniques to help display the conceptual range of a young, innovative art movement still establishing its pivotal place in the canon of art. These tensions parallel the work's underlying concept, accentuating the suspicion that a learned fear of emotional expression might just be the source of our own pang. \n\nCreated in p5.js, pang is inspired by the emotional works and processes of later abstract expressionists such as Cy Twombly and Joan Mitchell â as well as contemporary artists like JosÃ© Parla.\n\nFunctionality: \nPress âpâ to save as a png. \nPress âbâ to render with (or without) a transparent background.\nPress 0-9 to render at varying degrees of quality.  0 (lowest quality) to 9 (highest quality, 15000 pixels lengthwise).\nPress â¬ï¸ (arrow up) to incrementally increase pixel density.\nPress â¬ï¸ (arrow down) to incrementally decrease pixel density.\n\n__________\nTENDER x abstractment\nApril 2022\n",
