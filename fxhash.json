Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

Move the parameters freely to create your designs.\n\nHowever, completion is short-lived.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, the copies multiply repeatedly.\n\nModifications, alterations, and revisions are applied to the objects.\n\nConcurrently, the paper's decay and replication-induced noise compound on the drawing's surface.\n\nThis process repeats, archives, and...\n\nThe drawing becomes progressively more challenging to decipher.\n\nRandomized years of passage are set.\n\nThe longer the passage, the lengthier the animation, and the more effects overlap on the drawing. Enjoy the evolving animation.\n\nVertical lines flow from left to right throughout the animation.\n\nEach second represents a fictional decay of 10 years, and the year markings regress.\n\nOrigin and Creation of the Artwork:\n\nCurrently involved in the field of architecture, I've come across numerous old architectural drawings. These often prove difficult to interpret due to the obscurity caused by dirt and noise when compared to contemporary blueprints.\n\nWhile deciphering these intricate drawings, the idea emerged to represent the unique replication noise of copiers. Additionally, there's a fondness for the inherent aging of paper, which imparts a sense of history. Drawings that have been cherished and preserved for years progressively deteriorate due to fading and dirt.\n\nI aimed to combine the vintage deterioration seen in old maps and books with the noise generated by machines, creating an effect function.\n\nThe effects encompass both machine noise and aging noise.\n\nFor stochastic noise, I designed functions based on the same principles as actual photocopying. Colors are obtained from the original layer, slight discrepancies in position and color are introduced, and the color is redrawn.\n\nFor aging noise, I incorporated effects simulating wetting and drying of paper, hole formation, rust stains, and more.\n\nPress the 's' key to save the animation as a PNG.\n\nDue to being a beginner, there might be occasional malfunctions in parameters or hash values, and I appreciate your understanding.\n\nPlease share many of your original objects! With gratitude, I'll mix them all up:)\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\nFurthermore, I express gratitude to fxhash for allowing me to artistically manifest such ideas and share them with everyone.\n\nAlso, from my early years, I've always admired my father, who used to pore over blueprints. I think I created this work because I aspire to be like him.\n\n劣華-Rekka- について、\n\n\nこのアニメーション作品は、紙の複写ノイズと経年劣化がテーマです。\n\nコピーを重ねて生じるノイズ、紙そのものの風化や劣化が図面の内容や詳細が次第に見え難くなっていく様子を表現したアニメーション絵画作品です。\n\nあらゆるノイズエフェクトによってオリジナル状態が、\n複雑なビジュアルに書き換えられます。\n\nparamにてオリジナルの図形を描いてみてください。\nオブジェクトは、円、線、寸法線など。パラーメーターを自由に動かしてみてください。\n\n完成したのも束の間。\n\n数秒後にはコピーが何回も繰り返されます。\n\nオブジェクトに対し改変、変更、修正案が加えられます。\nそれと同時に紙の劣化、複写によるノイズが重ねて図面上に記録されてしまいます。\n\n\nそれがまた複写され、保存され、、、\nどんどん図面は解読が困難になっていきます。\n\nランダムに経過年数が設定されます。\n\n経過年数が長いほど、アニメーション時間は長くなります。\nその分図面上で起こるエフェクトは多く重なり合います。\nその変わりゆくアニメーションをお楽しみください。\n\nアニメーション中は縦線が左から右へと流れていきます。\n\n一秒毎に10年の劣化をフィクション値とし、年号が遡っていきます。\n\n-創案と経緯-\n\n私自身、現在、建築関係に携わっています。\nその中で、古い建築図の見る事があるのですが、\n現行の図面に比べて、汚れやノイズで見えづらい事が多々あります。\n\nそのような難解な図面を解読しているうちに、コピー機独特の複写ノイズを表現したいと考えました。\n\nまた、紙本来の経年劣化に、歴史を感じる愛おしさがありました。\n長年にわたって大切に保管された図面は原型を留めながらも、\nくすみや、汚れによって劣化していきます。\n\n古地図や古書に感じるビンテージな劣化と、\n機械的に生じたノイズの混同を表現できたらとエフェクト関数を制作していきました。\n\nエフェクトには、機械系ノイズと、劣化系ノイズがあります。\n\n機会的なノイズは、実際のコピーと同じ原理の関数を作りました。\nオリジナルレイヤーの色を取得し、元の位置と誤差を生じさせて、色を再度描画する。\n\n劣化ノイズでは、紙が濡れて乾いたような表現、穴が空くエフェクト、錆汚れ等。\n\n\"s\"キーPNG保存可能です。\n\nビギナーの為、パラメータやハッシュ値に誤動作がある可能性がありますがご了承ください。\n\n是非みなさんのたくさんのオリジナルオブジェクトを見せてください！！\n感謝をこめてぐちゃぐちゃにします:)\n\n\n楽しんでいただけると幸いです。",
