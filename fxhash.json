            "description": "“Raoul Pictor cherche son style…” (Raoul Pictor is looking for his style…) was launched in Saint-Gall, Switzerland, in 1993. It consists of a Mac LC computer, a 12-inch color screen, and an HP 500C printer.\nThe program presents an animation in which we can observe an artist, Raoul Pictor, working in his studio. He paints, paces while deep in thought, consults books from his library, plays the piano, and enjoys red wine. The sequence of these activities is non-linear. The canvas is seen from behind, resting on the easel in the center of the room. We are unable to see what is being painted. Once his painting is complete, he picks it up and exits through a side door. It is at this moment that the printer springs into action, delivering his unique, dated, and signed work.\nThis project has been exhibited in numerous exhibitions around the world. Subsequently, a Flash version, \"Raoul Pictor Web Studio,\" was developed to make it available on the internet (2001). In 2013, for its 20th anniversary, an iOS version, \"Raoul Pictor Mega Painter,\" was developed in collaboration with the great Matthieu Cherubini (mchrbn.net). \nIn 2023, for its 30th anniversary, an update seemed necessary to continue the adventure on the fx(hash) platform – thank you for making all of this possible! The development of this first fx version (“Country Spirit I”) was greatly enhanced by the wonderful support and expertise of the sha22.art team as well as our friends. Additional collections are now planned for the near future or special events...\n\n[up_arrow], [space bar] : Painter jumps in first part of animation.\n\n[p], [mouse click], [touch screen] : Save the painting when it is displayed.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

These plants, and the hills they inhabit, have long been a source of beauty and adventure in my life, and I find myself repeatedly drawn back to them. The sunsets in coastal California are a perfect compliment to these hills, and I set out to represent that combination in this work.\n\nEach iteration of this algorithm feels, to me, like a glimpse out of a car window on a drive up the coast, a pause on a cool morning hike, or a memory of tearing through sharp underbrush with good company.\n\nStylistically and texturally, I drew from landscapes rendered in oil pastels, placing thousands of tiny circles, alluding to the effect of depositing particles of color onto paper. \n\nI hope that this work evokes in the viewer the feelings of peace, wildness, and adventure that I feel when I watch the sun set over these hills.\n\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\nNotes:\n- Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.",

There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

We all feel this way from time to time — in our lives, jobs, bodies, situations — yet in our search for something, we shouldn't forget that there can still be beauty along the path.\n\nThe project takes some inspiration from Henri Matisse, both in the aesthetics of his later works (i.e. the \"Cut Outs\") and metaphorically in the sense that he had underwent medical treatment which left him wheelchair- or bed-bound towards the later part of his life, forcing him to give up painting, yet in his exploration of this new creative medium which involved cutting paper and pinning them up, his unorthodox work went on to become the most transformative of his career.\n\nReleased as part of the 4th edition of the Cure³ Parkinson's cure fundraiser exhibition organized by Artwise Curators and Bonhams as part of a specially comissioned selection of generative artists minting NFTs, curated by Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick with the support of fx(hash) at Bonhams, London from 13-17th January 2023.\n\n---\n33% of primary sales and 3% of secondary sales will be donated on-chain to Cure Parkinson’s\n---\n\nControls:\n• 'R' regenerates the piece (e.g. in case the window size changes)\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Jan 2023\nArtist: Yazid",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "Uninhabitable is a generative system built only from ellipses. The process of playing with different geometric and trigonometric disruptions gives rise to four different compositions which seek to evoque living constructions and environments. Besides the shape itself and its related distortion, the stroke weight of the lines plays a meaningful role in the piece. Following a discrete range [0.01,0.1,1] the weight reveals the process allowing the viewer to realize the trace of the huge amount of lines in each piece. This back and forth between scales and context is, while kind of stripping the code, part of my continuing interest on understanding the -usually- crazy paths of machines' way of thinking.\n\nPress \"h\" to see it and high resolution and refresh to get back to the initial state.

            "description": "“Raoul Pictor cherche son style…” (Raoul Pictor is looking for his style…) was launched in Saint-Gall, Switzerland, in 1993. It consists of a Mac LC computer, a 12-inch color screen, and an HP 500C printer.\nThe program presents an animation in which we can observe an artist, Raoul Pictor, working in his studio. He paints, paces while deep in thought, consults books from his library, plays the piano, and enjoys red wine. The sequence of these activities is non-linear. The canvas is seen from behind, resting on the easel in the center of the room. We are unable to see what is being painted. Once his painting is complete, he picks it up and exits through a side door. It is at this moment that the printer springs into action, delivering his unique, dated, and signed work.\nThis project has been exhibited in numerous exhibitions around the world. Subsequently, a Flash version, \"Raoul Pictor Web Studio,\" was developed to make it available on the internet (2001). In 2013, for its 20th anniversary, an iOS version, \"Raoul Pictor Mega Painter,\" was developed in collaboration with the great Matthieu Cherubini (mchrbn.net). \nIn 2023, for its 30th anniversary, an update seemed necessary to continue the adventure on the fx(hash) platform – thank you for making all of this possible! The development of this first fx version (“Country Spirit I”) was greatly enhanced by the wonderful support and expertise of the sha22.art team as well as our friends. Additional collections are now planned for the near future or special events...\n\n[up_arrow], [space bar] : Painter jumps in first part of animation.\n\n[p], [mouse click], [touch screen] : Save the painting when it is displayed.",
