            "description": "This is an album of cities too ideal to ever materialise.\n\nIt consists of 256 algorithmically generated plans that resemble drawings of Vincenzo Scamozzi, Pietro Cataneo, Filarete and other theorists of the Italian Renaissance. The cities differ in size, the grid of the streets, the landscape around them and the people that inhabit their utopian walls. They carry names that are Italian exonyms of real European cities, drawing a vision of a different world that enacts a mixture of military perfection with social superiority. Flawless, harmonious, unconquerable and utterly impossible.\n\nHistory brought us many theories about ideal cities, but very few examples exist today. Italian Palmanova or Polish Zamość are the few to remind us how hard it is to shape reality according to ideals. When confronted with the material world, its idealism becomes the city's grates foe.\n\nTo zoom, press a mouse button over the image or touch the screen.

A tube-amp from the 1960s with a spring reverb that when combined with single coils and hollow body of the guitar delivered screaming feedback as well as wonderfully gritty warm tones, which this algorithm attempts to echo visually.\n\nThere are 100 artist curated outputs in this short-form collection.\n\nKeys:\nS : save at current resolution\n1 → 6 : save 2000x2500 → 12000x15000\n(Chrome recommended for higher resolutions)",

            "description": "Each monogrid artwork gets initialized with a start up algorithm that builds up a set of rectangles and fills them with pixels. There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

Most of the population is located in big iconic hills known as the \"Seven Hills of Istanbul\". \n\n   In this project, I tried to capture and interpret the daily life routine of the people who live in these hills with the viewing point from Bosphorus. There are three camera angle possibilities to examine the details in different layers. Also, building types, the slope of the hill, and green area density vary in between those scenarios. There are two time zones: day and night. In the night scene, there is a possibility to obtain the crescent moon which is the symbol of the culture inhabits in these lands.\n\nTo save as a high-quality image, open in live view and click yes on the incoming prompt.\n\nCreated with p5js",
