            "description": "De/Frag is an homage to a classic algorithm in early computer art: Flood Fill. As a teenager in the late '80s, and without any literature, I spent weeks implementing a version for my very own drawing program for the Atari XL. It was the first non-trivial (to me) algorithm which made me want to learn more about data structures, the concept of recursion, divide-and-conquer...\n\nEven though Flood Fill was available in most commercial drawing & office apps of the time, I gained a deep appreciation of the algorithm by building it from scratch myself. 30+ years later I know its aesthetic possibilities are still far from exhausted. This is an invitation for re-exploration by others too!\n\nAs with many design algorithms, my primary interest isn't even the final result, but observing the inner workings. I massively slowed down and time-sliced the process for this piece. I do recommend giving each of these unique versions some time to allow them to evolve their ever-changing patterns (Note: each piece never loops!).",

            "description": "This work is composed of a combination of grids with line patterns, like my previous work \"Infinite Animation\" (Project #15745).  However, whereas the previous work was characterized by simplicity and regularity, this one is much more chaotic.\n\nFirst, while in the previous work the grids were fixed at 3 x 3, in this work there are variations from 5 x 5 to 20 x 20. \nAnd in this work, it is YOU who rotates the grid. Clicking on a grid rotates it 90 degrees and changes the image. If you have difficulty locating the grid, press the \"g\" key on the keyboard to display a guide (for touch devices, long press to show/hide the guide).\nIf you get tired of clicking, you can ask your computer to help you. You can toggle the animation mode with the \"a\" key on the keyboard (for touch devices, swipe up to turn on the mode, swipe down to turn it off). In animation mode, the computer rotates a random grid at regular intervals. (The surrounding frame turns green in animation mode.)\n\nThe fun of generative art lies in finding value, or to stretch the point a bit, destiny, in the random coincidences created by computers. Therefore, it is not aesthetically pleasing to artificially modify the derived result later. However, dynamism is also a characteristic of digital art. The fluidity of the results is probably one of its interesting features. I experimented with it in my previous work, \"Abstract Calligraphy\"(Project #15384), and have done it more characteristically in this project.\n\nThis picture is like a puzzle game, but there is no correct answer. No, there may be a correct answer. It depends on your aesthetic sense. Let's enjoy collaborating with the computer!",

            "description": "This work is composed of a combination of grids with line patterns, like my previous work \"Infinite Animation\" (Project #15745).  However, whereas the previous work was characterized by simplicity and regularity, this one is much more chaotic.\n\nFirst, while in the previous work the grids were fixed at 3 x 3, in this work there are variations from 5 x 5 to 20 x 20. \nAnd in this work, it is YOU who rotates the grid. Clicking on a grid rotates it 90 degrees and changes the image. If you have difficulty locating the grid, press the \"g\" key on the keyboard to display a guide (for touch devices, long press to show/hide the guide).\nIf you get tired of clicking, you can ask your computer to help you. You can toggle the animation mode with the \"a\" key on the keyboard (for touch devices, swipe up to turn on the mode, swipe down to turn it off). In animation mode, the computer rotates a random grid at regular intervals. (The surrounding frame turns green in animation mode.)\n\nThe fun of generative art lies in finding value, or to stretch the point a bit, destiny, in the random coincidences created by computers. Therefore, it is not aesthetically pleasing to artificially modify the derived result later. However, dynamism is also a characteristic of digital art. The fluidity of the results is probably one of its interesting features. I experimented with it in my previous work, \"Abstract Calligraphy\"(Project #15384), and have done it more characteristically in this project.\n\nThis picture is like a puzzle game, but there is no correct answer. No, there may be a correct answer. It depends on your aesthetic sense. Let's enjoy collaborating with the computer!",

Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",
