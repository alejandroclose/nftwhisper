            "description": "It all starts with a simple dot. If we enlarge it, we realize that it is in fact a square, and that we can assemble several of them, evenly spaced, to build a grid. This grid can be used as a basis for stacking a more or less large set of tetragons, and they combine with each other to form polygons, enhanced by a minimalist palette of colors, inspired by the work of Mondrian. The key to this orderly world is the use of the right angle.\n\nThus, everything has its place, and a place exists for everything.\n\n---\n\nYou can download various versions of this artwork :\n\n- press \"p\" to download a PNG at the current resolution of your browser\n- press \"h\" to download a high-resolution PNG (8K) suitable for print\n- press \"s\" to download an SVG version that you can then use to generate any image size\n\n---\n\nCoded with care, and with the help of p5.js, p5.js-svg and polybooljs libraries.\nConsider any bug that you could get in your edition as a blessing from the RNG Gods !",

The program laid out 8 unique elements in a grid, creating a three-dimensional viewing of objects in space. They published a paper about the underlying algorithm, found at: http://www.edwardzajec.com/tvc4/pil1/index.html\n\nTVC was first printed in 1971, shortly after Zajec returned to Italy following his artistic studies in the US. It was programmed on an IBM 9044 & printed with a CalComp 563 plotter.\n\nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to save a high-resolution version of the image\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nBy @christine_hall",

            "description": "Gerhard is a collaboration of Richard Nadler and Leander Herzog on fxhash. A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time. \nRichard Nadler created the textures to control composition and color. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels. This collaboration is enabled by twitter and fxhash, as the generative art community continues to explore abstraction in summer 2022 – while extreme temperatures, wildfires, ongoing conflicts and volatile markets continue to escalate. \n\n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color. \n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen mode. \n- Press “s” to save the current canvas. \n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nhttps://leanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/",

BETTER enjoy it on fullscreen.\nCAUTION: features will adjust to screen size.\n- press 's' to save an image.\n- click mouse to stop animation.\n- double-click to restart animation.\n\nmade with p5js and love\nmekhno / Marc L Clapers",

Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution.

            "description": "Each monogrid artwork gets initialized with a start up algorithm that builds up a set of rectangles and fills them with pixels. There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

It links a thousand pairs of points, harmoniously shifting across the canvas, with delicate lines. At each intersection of these lines, color is applied. To produce the final piece, multiple layers of varying colors and intensities are superimposed.\n\n------\n\nControls:\n\n- [x] Save a PNG\n\n- [1] Set height to 768\n- [2] Set height to 1152 \n- [3] Set height to 1536 (default)\n- [4] Set height to 2304\n- [5] Set height to 3072* \n- [6] Set height to 6144*\n- [7] Set height to 9216*\n- [8] Set height to 11520*\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render height\n\n\n* images with height over 3000 pixels render without animating, downloads a PNG automatically after rendering\n\nPlease note that high resolution outputs will take several minutes or even longer to render.

            "description": "Toccata is a piece about decay, about the impermanent. The emergence over time or, rather, progression of entropy is a key characteristic of our universe. Everything evolves to nothing. We as mortal beings have sometimes trouble reconciling with this idea. Humans have sought immortality for millennia, be it through ancient potions or modern medicine, be it from leaving a legacy that we feel will stand the test of time. It will, only to decay later than us.\n\nToccata is a piece about change. Change lies at the heart of human cognition and human nature. Our thoughts and our emotions happen over time, and are a function of the change that is both around us and at the very core of our selves. Change comes in nature in cycles. Seasons of growth, seasons of ripe fruits of life, seasons of decay, of death, rebirth.\n\nToccata is music. We find music to convey some of the deepest streams of human condition, connecting it to some other form of being. Music also happens over time, and music happens because of change. Music encodes our feelings better than any other aid we may have. Toccata incorporates this at its very core, as the main sound is Andreas' family piano where he learned to play, sampled this past July.\n\nRead more about the piece, and the collaboration between Marcelo and Andreas on andreasrau.eu/toccata\n\n---\n\nBasic controls:\n- Click on the piece or press spacebar to start it (WebAudio requires user intervention for the music to start). Once the music has started, again click or press spacebar to play/pause.\n- Press “s” to save a still at the current resolution\n- Press “r” to start recording a video at the current resolution, then “r” again to stop.\n\n---\n\nWebM audio-video recording performed using the library RecordRTC by https://muazkhan.com/, MIT licence.",

            "description": "TRIANGULAR is an artistic exploration rooted in my long-standing fascination with Penrose triangles and the captivating creations of M.C. Escher. This generative art series delves into the realm of impossible geometry, weaving together intricate patterns that engage the viewer's imagination. By combining elements of order and chaos, TRIANGULAR seeks to offer a visually striking and immersive experience that invites curiosity and wonder while highlighting the interconnected nature of our world.\n\nAs the creator of TRIANGULAR, my intention was to use art as a means to encourage an open-minded approach to new ideas and possibilities. The detailed patterns and optical illusions within the series serve as a reminder of art's power to push boundaries and provoke thought, illustrating how even the most seemingly impossible concepts can come to life through creative expression. The series not only celebrates the limitless potential of artistic imagination but also invites viewers to embrace the transformative power of art in expanding their perspectives and transcending the limits of their own reality. Through this exploration, TRIANGULAR aims to foster a deeper connection with the endless creativity that resides within each of us.\n\n\n\nTo save the current render, double-click on the canvas\n\nTo generate a custom sized edition, add the url parameter \"&size=xxx\" where xxx is the desired width in pixels.

            "description": "This series explores the remnants and imprints of past events; the unintended consequences and marks left behind: The floor of a painter's studio, layered with splatters and spills; the face of a rock, sculpted by the relentless touch of water and ice; the rusty hood of a forsaken car, weathered and chipped under the harsh sun.\n\nThe art piece is crafted by an algorithm simulating the effects of abrasion from a consistent yet dynamic process. It links a thousand pairs of points, harmoniously shifting across the canvas, with delicate lines. At each intersection of these lines, color is applied. To produce the final piece, multiple layers of varying colors and intensities are superimposed.\n\n------\n\nControls:\n\n- [x] Save a PNG\n\n- [1] Set height to 768\n- [2] Set height to 1152 \n- [3] Set height to 1536 (default)\n- [4] Set height to 2304\n- [5] Set height to 3072* \n- [6] Set height to 6144*\n- [7] Set height to 9216*\n- [8] Set height to 11520*\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render height\n\n\n* images with height over 3000 pixels render without animating, downloads a PNG automatically after rendering\n\nPlease note that high resolution outputs will take several minutes or even longer to render.
