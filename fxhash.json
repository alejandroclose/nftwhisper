            "description": "This project was started in December 2021. At that time, I didn't know what the result would be. It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

For this reason this profile is not, and should never be verified by fx(hash) and collectors should pay extra caution when collecting from it.\n\nYours, CCDDBB\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\nPowered by p5 and chroma.\n\n----------------------------------------------\nTheWallet original post: https://typed.art/967\n----------------------------------------------\n\n",

            "description": "Assemblage:\n  - a collection or gathering of things or people\n  - a machine or object made of pieces fitted together\n  - a work of art made by grouping together found or unrelated objects\n\nMore than often, it is the case that my projects start out as collections of unrelated ideas. These ideas sometimes revolve around specific algorithmic concepts, with the aim to combine, remix and chain together methods in some novel way. In other instances these ideas are a vague vision of particular aesthetic that I'm trying to chase down. Usually though, it's a bit of a mix of both. Assemblage was conceived in this manner, evolving from the combination of several Genuary sketches.\n\nTo play into this narrative and further it a little bit, while searching for a suitable name for the project, I thought that the art in of itself, in some way, looked like a disassembled or shattered machine, with the constituent pieces scattered and strewn around in a chaotic manner. This is in contrast to fact that the items are actually positioned in a very orderly and systematic manner, where no two shapes can technically overlap or intersect, creating an interplay of Order and Chaos.\n\nPress S to download a PNG version of the artwork. 2400 x 3000 pixels.\nIt can take up to a couple of seconds to generate all of the graphics.",

            "description": "------------\nIntroduction\n------------\nArgentina is world-renowned for its exquisite wine, and the Malbec grape has long been a celebrated variety. While most of the country’s wine comes from the region of Cuyo, specifically the province of Mendoza, there is another hidden gem that is often overlooked: Entre Rios.\n\nNamed after the two massive rivers that surround it, Entre Rios is a province located in the northeast of Argentina. What many people don’t know is that it boasts a long and fascinating history of wine production that dates back to the early 19th century.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Entre Rios, I had the pleasure of exploring a small vineyard located near the Parana river. As I walked among the vines, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by their vibrant colors, intricate patterns of the leaves, and the beautiful clusters of grapes. It was clear to me that there was something truly special about the vineyards of Entre Rios.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the region’s history, I discovered that until 1937, Entre Rios was one of the largest wine producers in the country, with over 60 vineyards operating in the province. However, a national law was passed that year creating the Regulating Board of Wine, which concentrated and granted exclusivity to wine production in Cuyo. It wasn’t until 1993 that the law was repealed, allowing vineyards to be planted and modified throughout the country.\n\nToday, Entre Rios is home to a small but thriving wine industry that is known for its unique blends and varietals. One of the most notable grapes is the Tannat, which was once the predominant variety in the region.\n\nInspired by the beauty of these vineyards, I decided to create a generative art collection that celebrates the colors, shapes, and textures of the grapes and vines called ‘Lorda’.\n\n\n-----------\nAbout Lorda\n-----------\nTannat originates in southwest France (Madiran). However, it was not very admired there, so Tannat began its journey: it moved to our country, in the trunks of a Basque, Juan Jauregui, and settled in Entre Rios towards the end of the 1800s. This farmer nicknamed “El Lorda” planted Tannat in Concordia and managed to make a quite respectable wine. The grape took that nickname and became known as Lorda.\n\n\n-----\n\nPress \"e\" to save a high res png while in live mode.\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2023)\n\nMade with P5js and <3",

            "description": "A #genuary32nd project.\nA hot summer downpour in an oppressive city.\n\nMy method for Genuary was to read the prompt for the next day before going to bed, sleeping on it, and then try to quickly find an interesting idea with my morning coffee.\n\nThe prompt for Day 19 was \"Black and White\". My mind went to the high-contrast style of comic-book writer and artist Frank Miller, specifically \"Sin City\" and \"The Dark Knight Returns\" and their heavy film-noir influences. The result can be found here : https://ulucode.com/genuary2023/19/\n\nThis project is a more polished version of my work that day with a few additional features.\n\nThe intended output is what first appears, but in the spirit of Genuary, you can explore and experiment with the controls provided to get creative, but also see under the hood.\nThe camera is left free, so you can change the point of view.\nHere are the camera controls ( mobile in parenthesis ) :\n- Mouse left click and drag (Touch drag) to rotate.\n- Mouse Right and drag (Two fingers drag) to pan.\n- Mouse Wheel/Middle (Pinch) to zoom\n\n/// Press SPACE (or Double Tap on mobile) to show/hide the MENU. ///\n\nIn this MENU you can :\n\n- Adjust the anti-aliasing quality : mostly for the animation and camera manipulations. Default is \"medium\". Try reducing the quality if the animation is choppy. Set it to \"ideal\" for optimal quality.\n- Aspect ratio : you can change the desired aspect ratio from the default \"poster\" to \"window\", in which case the piece resizes itself to fill the window in which it is displayed. Useful if you want to capture in other formats.\n- Animated : toggle to start/stop the animation\n- Display frame : toggle to hide/show the comic-like frame\n- Display stats : toggle to display a small FPS counter in the top left.\n\n- Export : choose the resolution and press the \"Export capture\" button to export a PNG of what is currently displayed. Warning : large resolutions can take a few seconds and weigh around 300Mo. This is the recommended method if you want CLEAN graphic files.\n\nNFT License\n\nRuns on Three.js : https://threejs.org/\nGUI uses lil-gui : https://www.npmjs.com/package/lil-gui\n\n",
