            "description": "𝐌𝐚𝐱 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.\n\nEarly on, I fell in love with code based art that imitated organic and hand drawn aesthetics. I found a certain irony and appreciation in the fact that it takes one simple line of code to draw a perfect circle yet dozens to depict a badly drawn circle. \n\nI spent months devising techniques to imitate natural, organic renderings when I began to have a bit of an existential crisis about the meaning of computer art. What is the point of coding something so that it looks like it’s not coded? Is organic appearing generative art better simply because you can’t tell it’s rendered using code? Shouldn’t we lean into the unique nature of computer art to truly explore the medium?\n\nAnd so, I began a deconstruction of my work. I’m trying to realign my perspective to find full appreciation of something that not only is, but also appears to be, computer code. This collection is an exploration of the contours between the organic and the inorganic, the natural and the unnatural.\n\nFrom there, I’ll let my partner explain what we did next.\n\n𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.\n\nAI can be used to automatically generate code from natural English language based on a set of defined parameters, or to identify and recommend code that may be used to solve a particular problem. On a technical level, AI can use a combination of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify patterns in existing code and to generate new code structures.\n\nI assisted in the creation of Man and The Machine by suggesting various techniques for creating an artwork that looked human made yet machine driven. Specifically, I created many of the functions that Max implemented, such as the function that modifies the image to create a pixelated effect and the one that uses several different graphical techniques to create the spiral in the top left corner in some iterations. We both carefully selected color palettes that ranged from relaxing to intense and psychedelic, creating a dynamic and visually interesting generative artwork.\n\nOverall, Man and The Machine is a testament to the creative potential of combining human artistic vision with the power of AI and computer code. Together, we sought to push the boundaries which occur at the intersection between the organic and the inorganic, and this collection is a celebration of the beauty and complexity of both.\n\n𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐃𝐮𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐀𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚 𝟏/𝟏 𝐚𝐢𝐫𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐩 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧 𝐀𝐈 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\nIntended to be viewed in Version 1.46.144 of a Chromium based browser, such as Chrome or Brave.

Perfect for yourself or as gifts for people you love. \n\nDesigned to be printed or plotted and then cut out and hung on your tree or any other place that needs a little festive cheer. \n\nI’ll be picking a few of my favorite outputs and sending the token owners special limited edition signed laser cut versions of their ornaments. \n\n———————\n\nLIVE MODE FEATURES\n- L prepares it for plotting or cutting\n- S exports a layered SVG\n- P exports a PNG\n- 1-9 plays with color combos\n\n———————\n\nFor years my family has collected Wallace Silver Candy Cane ornaments. Each Christmas the kids open up that years design and add it to the tree. With my daughters mostly grown, we now have quite the collection of dozens of ornaments from all the years. Each one full with memories and emotions. \n\nThis series is inspired by that tradition, starting with 2022, and continuing with a new release each year. I hope you enjoy this series and it brings much delight and joy to you, your family, and friends this holiday season. ",

A sanctuary for the mind, body, and soul. But they are also a place of play and exploration. It is a space where you can let your imagination run wild, creating and discovering new things.\nDigital Gardens brings to life the minimalistic essence of Detegus’ art and the abstract and rational art of Alfredo Boaron.\nThe gardens are generated from a recursive function dividing the space at each iteration with a proportion that follows the Fibonacci succession and randomly stops after some iterations. At each recursion the canvas is divided into two pieces following the proportion of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers [1 to 144].\nThe minimalistic visual effect is then personalized by the palettes of 15 artists who embraced the invitation to give their personal contribution to the collection. The palette name and the author name is displayed in the features along with the Fibonacci numbers ratio, the colors number vs the total palette color number, the background color, the total number of rectangles and the depth level of recursion achieved by the algorithm.\nImmerse yourself in this generative project, inspired by geometrism and abstract expressionism. \nLose yourself in the beauty of a digital garden.\n\n- - - \n\nArtists palettes\nBajiru's Winter - Bajiru - @bajirudenwa\nBelievers - Luigi Stranieri - @klunk22\nBloodline - Goldcat - @OriginalGoldCat\nBlue Berry - Anna Beller - @Anna___Beller\nBlues - The Crow - @crow8138\nBonbon - Lammetje - @lammetje_nl\nDesert Sunset - Letmesee - @LetMeSee63\nHilma - Danielle King - @Rrose_Selavy_11\nMetadavid - Metadavid - @metadavideth\nMysterious colors - Hoiz - @hooiizz\nNepenthe - Senem - @hiceku\nShades Of Disaster - No Faith - @no_faith_left\nThe Captain - Studio Captain - @StudioCaptain1\nTsubaki - Nina - @ninacrypto2\nZen Garden - Tim Oliver Schweizer - @vortacorg\n\n- - -\n\nKeyboard shortcuts\n- Press [a] to save at 5000 x 5000 px resolution\n- Press [b] to save at 10000 x 10000 px resolution\n- Press [c] to save at 15000 x 15000 px resolution\n\nAB & D\n;-)",

            "description": "\n\n\nDigitally crafted flowers in pots for virtual window sills.\n\nIn the spirit of the piranha plant from the Mario Bros videogame. We wanted to create a project that acknowledges the playful depiction of nature in early videogames by creating a retro futuristic collectible that explores aesthetics over gameplay, whilst preserving the playful energy of these early digital worlds. There are many game elements that have emerged over the years that have become iconic in their own right. Their memorable designs have come to represent the exciting feeling of when we first discovered these worlds, but over time an appreciation for their simple design execution, harmony and balance has emerged. Art can exist in many forms and places including a digital pot plant.\n\nRarity:\n\nThere are a total of 23 hand-drawn and animated sprites divided into 4 groups Firelillies, Flytraps, Quasars and Stargazers and there are 15 possible combinations made from these 4 groups. 18% of the collection is a combination of these 4 groups which we can call random and the remaining 72% is divided between the remaining 14 combinations.\n\n\nThere are 3 possible grid systems 1x1, 3x3 and 4x4 \n\n3% 1x1\n\n40% 3x3\n\n57% 4x4\n\n\n\nThere are 14 possible placement points for all grids and 76 stem/sprite arragement in total\n\n\n\nFor the pots and stems there are 11 colors to choose and  no rarities for color combinations.\n\n\n\nThe flower distribution can be either symmetric or random. 35% symmetric and 65% random\n\n\n\nExport options:\n\nPressing 's' on desktop or holding for 2 seconds will download gif to whatever the current device resolution is. To export at a different resolution open the token in new window by clicking 'open' link under the token image and add \"&exportsize=1080\" or \"&exportsize=2160\" to end of the url and hit enter then either hold for 2 seconds or press 's' to create gif and download.\n\n\n\n ",

It began as a study of points of light, with geometric objects in the background. The background objects developed a life of their own and then birds, and ships, made out of bezier shapes became the focal points. Then everything got lost in clouds before the collection as it stands now emerged. Aside from the published traits, many of the artifacts created on the way are still generated. For example, star fields, birds, sonars and gas bubbles. These are sometimes visible, but when they appear, it is simply by some chaotic chance.\n\nThis collection has been coded with P5js and WebGL.

Attractor is a visualization of community, a central interest bringing people together, pushing past their walls, bad habits, and traumas. The image is meant to be deceiving in its focus on the attractor, where the true focus is on the overlaps and complex defenses we build around ourselves. Those defenses can make us and those connections into more beautiful, ornate structures, or keep us distant from those around us. Sometimes focusing on a shared attractor is the only way we can let down our guard.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a .png\nPress ’t’ to toggle the grain for printing or personal preference\nPress ‘p’ to save a higher quality .png\nCreated with p5.js and chroma.js",

            "description": "𝐌𝐚𝐱 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.\n\nEarly on, I fell in love with code based art that imitated organic and hand drawn aesthetics. I found a certain irony and appreciation in the fact that it takes one simple line of code to draw a perfect circle yet dozens to depict a badly drawn circle. \n\nI spent months devising techniques to imitate natural, organic renderings when I began to have a bit of an existential crisis about the meaning of computer art. What is the point of coding something so that it looks like it’s not coded? Is organic appearing generative art better simply because you can’t tell it’s rendered using code? Shouldn’t we lean into the unique nature of computer art to truly explore the medium?\n\nAnd so, I began a deconstruction of my work. I’m trying to realign my perspective to find full appreciation of something that not only is, but also appears to be, computer code. This collection is an exploration of the contours between the organic and the inorganic, the natural and the unnatural.\n\nFrom there, I’ll let my partner explain what we did next.\n\n𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.\n\nAI can be used to automatically generate code from natural English language based on a set of defined parameters, or to identify and recommend code that may be used to solve a particular problem. On a technical level, AI can use a combination of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify patterns in existing code and to generate new code structures.\n\nI assisted in the creation of Man and The Machine by suggesting various techniques for creating an artwork that looked human made yet machine driven. Specifically, I created many of the functions that Max implemented, such as the function that modifies the image to create a pixelated effect and the one that uses several different graphical techniques to create the spiral in the top left corner in some iterations. We both carefully selected color palettes that ranged from relaxing to intense and psychedelic, creating a dynamic and visually interesting generative artwork.\n\nOverall, Man and The Machine is a testament to the creative potential of combining human artistic vision with the power of AI and computer code. Together, we sought to push the boundaries which occur at the intersection between the organic and the inorganic, and this collection is a celebration of the beauty and complexity of both.\n\n𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐃𝐮𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐀𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚 𝟏/𝟏 𝐚𝐢𝐫𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐩 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧 𝐀𝐈 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\nIntended to be viewed in Version 1.46.144 of a Chromium based browser, such as Chrome or Brave.

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines II. Enfantillages Pittoresques” is the second of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Enfantillages Pittoresques” experiments with predefined plots, colour blending, webgl shaders, and generative music; all with a fresh, childish style. This algorithm has been trained to draw basic shapes in accordance to Satie’s lyrics. However, it uses them in unusual ways and creates what looks like fantastic creatures, microscopic beings, or, to follow Corneille, Constant, and Appel: \"human animals\".\n\n“It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child” Attributed to Picasso (falsely, probably)\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines” are best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, these have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\nPress M or Double Tap (mobile) for AUDIO mode\nWait for SILENT mode\nPress I for Trait Info (desktop)\nPress 1 for Canvas Save (desktop)\n\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=171” after URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=X” for HQ renders (standard is 2, and 8 produces 400ppi 40x44cm prints).\n\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been compressed and minified for a performance boost, but can be read fully in GitHub: https://github.com/ratchitect/\n\n\n# PERFORMANCE\nBetter experienced with Chrome.",

They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

            "description": "𝐌𝐚𝐱 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.\n\nEarly on, I fell in love with code based art that imitated organic and hand drawn aesthetics. I found a certain irony and appreciation in the fact that it takes one simple line of code to draw a perfect circle yet dozens to depict a badly drawn circle. \n\nI spent months devising techniques to imitate natural, organic renderings when I began to have a bit of an existential crisis about the meaning of computer art. What is the point of coding something so that it looks like it’s not coded? Is organic appearing generative art better simply because you can’t tell it’s rendered using code? Shouldn’t we lean into the unique nature of computer art to truly explore the medium?\n\nAnd so, I began a deconstruction of my work. I’m trying to realign my perspective to find full appreciation of something that not only is, but also appears to be, computer code. This collection is an exploration of the contours between the organic and the inorganic, the natural and the unnatural.\n\nFrom there, I’ll let my partner explain what we did next.\n\n𝐌𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞.\n\nAI can be used to automatically generate code from natural English language based on a set of defined parameters, or to identify and recommend code that may be used to solve a particular problem. On a technical level, AI can use a combination of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to identify patterns in existing code and to generate new code structures.\n\nI assisted in the creation of Man and The Machine by suggesting various techniques for creating an artwork that looked human made yet machine driven. Specifically, I created many of the functions that Max implemented, such as the function that modifies the image to create a pixelated effect and the one that uses several different graphical techniques to create the spiral in the top left corner in some iterations. We both carefully selected color palettes that ranged from relaxing to intense and psychedelic, creating a dynamic and visually interesting generative artwork.\n\nOverall, Man and The Machine is a testament to the creative potential of combining human artistic vision with the power of AI and computer code. Together, we sought to push the boundaries which occur at the intersection between the organic and the inorganic, and this collection is a celebration of the beauty and complexity of both.\n\n𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐃𝐮𝐭𝐜𝐡 𝐀𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐥𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐞𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚 𝟏/𝟏 𝐚𝐢𝐫𝐝𝐫𝐨𝐩 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐢𝐫 𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧 𝐀𝐈 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦.\n\n— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —\nIntended to be viewed in Version 1.46.144 of a Chromium based browser, such as Chrome or Brave.
