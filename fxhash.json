            "description": "I try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "Komšije,' a word meaning 'neighbors' in Serbian, is an art piece that intertwines architectural elements with the Golden Ratio (1:1.618). Inspired by the brutalist architecture of New Belgrade, Serbia, and my love for minimalism and modernism, this work explores the possibilities of this combination generatively.\n\nThe buildings of New Belgrade, a significant inspiration for this piece, exhibit a unique character. Despite their aesthetic, which may have fallen out of popular style, these structures are exceptionally solid and well-designed, having withstood the test of time. More than mere apartment blocks, they represent vertical ecosystems. Within their stark and imposing concrete forms exist a multitude of private worlds, each suspended in a communal yet distinct space, embodying the essence of interconnectedness and resilience.\n\nThe Golden Ratio, a recurring element in my creations, is a proportion frequently found in nature. It is visible in sea shell spirals and human body proportions, offering an aesthetically pleasing and comforting familiarity.\n\nIn 'Komšije,' this ratio arranges mostly residential architectural forms in elevation view, blending Mid-Century modernism, Japanese post-modernism, and Eastern European brutalism. The compositions are created by repeatedly dividing the width and height of each piece by the Golden Ratio, ensuring every element is proportionally related to the whole. This method aligns column widths and floor heights, maintaining a cohesive structure.\n\nThe artwork strikes a balance between formal architectural diagrams and hand-drawn sketches. It features generative imperfections that mimic my sketching style, fostering a sense of openness and possibility missing from formal or detailed diagrams and renders. Although the structures depicted may not be architecturally practical, they are designed to evoke a sense of wonder and joy through their playful geometry and massing.\n\n—————\n\nTENDER x Studio Yorktown\nDecember 2023\n\n'Komšije’ is Serbian for ‘neighbors’, and is a generative art series created by Studio Yorktown in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n—————\n\nKey Commands : \n\nPress ‘S’ to save a high-resolution output of your structure.",

            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

The algorithm, inspired by the playfulness of childhood, generates whimsical, childlike paintings reminiscent of a time when computers were new, and learning happened through wild exploration.\n\nCrafted to capture the boundless creativity of a child lost in play, the algorithm yields artworks adorned with pixelated allure, employing a captivating blend of black and white enhanced by dither aesthetics.\n\nPress 4 or 8 to export in 4k and 8k in PNG.\nPress 's' to export in screen resolution.\n\nMurat Atimtay 2024 | @atimtay | https://www.atimtay.xyz\"",

            "description": "Energy is everywhere: it’s moving our bodies, buzzing around a city, growing the universe, and connecting everything within it. Perhaps the strongest symbol humans use for energy – for ideas, life, and the various incarnations of power – is light itself. \n\nFor centuries, each form of art has tried to capture the energetic luminescence of a bright light, a warm glow, a spark... if we could only draw with its pure brilliance! From Caravaggio’s diagonal beams, to Picasso drawing with light across Gjon Mili’s photographic emulsions… this pursuit persists through obsessive efforts by artists of every media. \n\na fortiori seeks to capture this power of light with code, output on the native illumination of modern screens. The visual deconstruction of light and its reassembly into a frozen moment produces the tangible shards of each spark – resulting in a sum of marks that exceeds the value of their individual parts. It’s then the obsessive energy of generative art’s looping and controlled randomness that enable its repeated mark making, of all types, to express the nearly-intangible intensity of light.\n\nWhat one hand might communicate in drawing, with light or stick or keyboard, 100 hands would therefore say 100 times louder, clearer, and more impactfully. And if one could capture the authentic energy of traveling light in a single image, it stands to reason that 500 of these images will multiply their energy-inducing qualities together, and exponentially grow their collective power. In this idea, the medium is the message – proving the power of the medium, and its ability to generate energy.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x Thomas Noya\nDecember 2022\n\nSource code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\na fortiori was created in p5.js and is optimized for live output in Chrome.

It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

            "description": "The <iframe> HTML element is an element that allows a web document to embed the contents of another web document within itself. iframes are at the core of fxhash. They are portals opening our view to rich content.\n\nThis work is a portal to itself. It loads itself within itself 20 times. It's not pretty, it reminds us of WordArt, it's a little bit hacky, it might break when our tools to display HTML will change. But it's a proof that the limits of our tools are only limits until creativity breaks them.\n\nThis work is not purely deterministic, because it simply cannot be. Slight timing differences due to loading times being different each time an <iframe> is loaded will make each visualization slightly unique.\n\nIf you view this token on mobile, the nesting limit was reduced to 4 to prevent performance issues.\n\nThis work is highly experimental. It leverages a \"hack\" to allow iframes to be nested.\nFirefox max <iframe> nesting depth as of 28/12/2021 is capped at 9.\nWorks with chrome desktop 96.0.4664.110",
