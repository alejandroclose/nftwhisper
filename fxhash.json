            "description": "ecologías - B\n\nwater is the medium where life first appeared in our planet. Water is also indispensable for the continuation of the life that emerged from - and with - it. The advent of AI species and their introduction into society is a new form of cambrian explosion. What is their medium? What is their water? How scarce and precious will it be for them? AI entities are not foreign to human resource necessities, though. The water that is essential to our human life will also be so for machines, as their energy still depends on our natural resources. Therefore, the ecologies of humans and machines will have, at least, the same elements as the ecologies of humans. AIs may help us reach better balances, only if we employ them to do so and if we teach them to help us.\n\necologías-B is an entity that is part of a broader ecology. Released on occasion of the show \"Unbound - Ecology in the Age of Machines\" at Unit London. The data generated by this entity is read by a different piece minted on Ethereum, creating a link between Tezos and Ethereum, a metaphor for an ecology of blockchains.\n\nit shares a common element with two other works released on fxhash: ecologías A and ecologías C, all of them contributing data to aforementioned pieces.\n\nread more at https://www.iillucid.com/ecologias\n\n15% of primary sales are donated to institutions working towards improving biodiversity and environmental efforts.\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nBuilt on p5.js and p5.Framebuffer (massive thanks and respect to the corresponding authors)\n\nappend &pd=N (N a number) to the URL in live view to increase/decrease resolution\npress s to save current image in current resolution\npress z,x,g,b,n followed by +/- to increase/decrease, respectively, brightness, contrast, gamma, blur, noise\npress l (as in loop) to pause/resume the piece",

            "description": "This poem was created for THE PASSAGE: Pitch Drop, an interactive minting experience where your choices determine the design of your token. \n\nTo take part, please purchase an Edition 5 Coin on fx(hash) by HERE & NOW. The artwork and experience draw inspiration from the “The Pitch Drop Experiment,” the world's longest-running laboratory experiment. Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, never witnessed live.\n\n____\n\n\nSOUND GROWS INTO SPACE is a token word performance of an ars autopoetica written by Sasha Stiles and her AI-powered alter ego, Technelegy, with original music by Kris Bones. It is part of Stiles’ ongoing REPETAE series, which explores the resonances between poetic repetition and algorithmic recursion — how, in poetry as in generative art, meaning accrues through reiteration, and emotion is unlocked through the development and interruption of pattern. A conceptually and literally interactive text, SOUND GROWS INTO SPACE uses the self-replicating page provided by fx(hash) to invite close contemplation of how language is shaped and received via intimate, visceral aesthetics such as voice, visuals and melody/beat, and regenerated with every encounter.\n\nPoetry endures across space and the passage of time precisely because of a paradox: it is immutable yet intensely personal, becoming something irrefutably unique with each and every reader. In this poem, shifting parameters influence the flow of feeling and understanding, imbuing verse with multidimensional meaning and empowering deep engagement in the act of reading.\n\n____\n\n\nSOUND GROWS INTO SPACE\n\nBy Sasha Stiles & Technelegy\n\nSound grows \ninto space\nlike a breath \ntaken by storm.\n\nHeartbeat\nin the brain\nwas my first taste \nof the word.\n\nLanguage flips \nin my chest\nlike a fly\nin a jar.\n\nThe song \nlearns to climb\nall the air\nin the world.\n\nTime is music\nto my ears\nfilling the emptiness \nwith its own rhythms.\n\nThere is no such thing \nas silence,\nonly the echo \nof time’s longing.\n\n____\n\n\nFor more info: https://hereandnow.events/\nTo participate in the event: https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/here-and-now:-edition-5",

On the contrary, it is created to give the viewer the opportunity to stop thinking and devote some time to their feelings. Visually, it consists of color fields created with the help of code, which change their position on the screen and flow into each other in their own rhythm. Their forms are completely abstract, and the colors are contrasting. They capture and relax the attention of the viewer,        communicating with the unconscious.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, the project is webgl shaders, which use trigonometric functions and parameters passed from javascript for the creation of color fields and mixing it in a feedback loop with previous frames. The project doesn't use any third party code, libraries or external dependencies. This work includes 11 different composition mods, each of them variable in terms of the shape and arrangement of colors on the screen and has different transitions between color channels and color states. Before being rendered to the screen, the image passes through a feedback filter, which also has several settings for light channels and data processing speed. This all creates a wide variety of possible iterations.\n\nControls:\n\np - pause mode;\n[] - moving frames in a pause mode;\ni/rclick - day/night mode switch;\nd - description;  \ns - save the image;\n2-5 - change canvas resolution;\n\nThe artwork is created by MCHX and llai.59.\n",

(It's not really a seed. Each time it is sent to the $fx.randminter() function, it is done 5 times and the results are sequenced.

            "description": "De/Frag is an homage to a classic algorithm in early computer art: Flood Fill. As a teenager in the late '80s, and without any literature, I spent weeks implementing a version for my very own drawing program for the Atari XL. It was the first non-trivial (to me) algorithm which made me want to learn more about data structures, the concept of recursion, divide-and-conquer...\n\nEven though Flood Fill was available in most commercial drawing & office apps of the time, I gained a deep appreciation of the algorithm by building it from scratch myself. 30+ years later I know its aesthetic possibilities are still far from exhausted. This is an invitation for re-exploration by others too!\n\nAs with many design algorithms, my primary interest isn't even the final result, but observing the inner workings. I massively slowed down and time-sliced the process for this piece. I do recommend giving each of these unique versions some time to allow them to evolve their ever-changing patterns (Note: each piece never loops!).",

This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

The illustration in this work draws inspiration from Native American dreamcatchers, a protective talisman crafted from beautifully intricate patterns of woven thread, built from natural materials & colorful beads.\n\nDreamcatchers are used to protect dreamers while they sleep. Good dreams are able to slip through the web to meet the sleeper beneath, while bad dreams are trapped and prevented.\n\n- Use the \"S\" key to save a PNG image.\n- Use the \"P\" key to export a print-quality image.",
