One sunny morning, the village elders approached Samuel with a special request. They sought to erect a grand wall in the village square, a symbol of unity and prosperity.

            "description": "## regenerate : what is it about? ##\n\nI wanted the gradients to portray our inner energy status, like a power charge we keep regenerating. Made of many steps, they create the illusion of continuity. And, just like us, they sometimes disfunction.❤️\n\nThe title illustrates both the energy of these geometric outputs and my own return to a generative art practice. It's also a nod to the \"degen\" culture.\n\n## variations ##\n\nregenerate has 3 types of outputs:\n- the single column, in full color - these are the main outputs and define the visual identity of the drop - pure energy!\n- the single color column on grey - pure contrast!\n- the triplet - dysfunctional in the best sense!\nWell, there might be a 4th type, but that's a surprise...\n\nFor each mint, the number of steps will vary from 60 to 200+. The way the gradients blend into the larger background also depends on the mint: some blend completely, while other tend to the background color but never quite reach it.\n\n## Keyboards controls ##\n\n's' saves a high-res version of your output (4096x4096 px)\n‘m’ saves a low-res version (500 x 500 px), useful for social media\n'p' saves TWO smartphone formatted crops (1176 x 2556 px) so you can take your mint with you all day - one in full saturation, one at half saturation - you can use one for your lockscreen and one for your homescreen, for example, or you can make your own crops from the high-res image.\n\n## Technical note ##\n\nDepending on the size of your window, the number of steps may vary. That is intentional, and made to avoid any moire effects when scaling down. Instead, the overall impression of the output will remain visually the same at any scale.\n\n## Conclusion ## \n\nI hope you enjoy your mint, whether it's a single, triplet, or a powerful color on grey!\nThanks for reading and thanks for minting! 🙏\n\n-raphael, sept. 2023.",

            "description": "Strands of memory are twisted and entangled with each other, blending in and out with the surrounding fog of chaos. Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

            "description": "Thoughtscapes: A Kaleidoscope of Emotions\" is an abstract painting that artfully conveys the intricate relationship between thoughts and feelings. The canvas becomes a canvas of the mind, where emotions and thoughts blend and clash in a symphony of color and form. The bold strokes and rich palette evoke a wide range of feelings. It's an invitation to delve into the kaleidoscope of emotions that shape our lives and reflect upon the beauty that emerges when thoughts and feelings merge on the canvas of our existence.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nThe collection is made in pure code with p5.js.\n\nThe piece is my first work being published.

            "description": "This algorithm I've named Flow3.js is like a dance of mathematics and digital art. Imagine myself at the center of a virtual world, where the rules of art and science merge into a harmonious dance.\n\nIn the center of the stage stands the \"Cellular Automaton,\" a digital entity with a life of its own. This entity is composed of a grid of cells, each with a state, 0 or 1, like two actors taking turns on the stage. Each turn, these actors follow a pre-defined script, the \"rules,\" which change their state based on their past behavior. It's as if the stage itself is a fabric in constant transformation, woven by the very rules.\n\nBeyond the main stage, there's a secondary dance in progress. Here, \"particles\" elegantly move through a flow field. This field is generated by the art of noise, where chaos and randomness create seemingly random beauty. The particles follow the flow, dancing through invisible currents, like leaves drifting in a mountain stream.\n\nThe particles themselves are like digital brushstrokes on the virtual canvas. Each particle has a position, a velocity, and a color. When a particle passes through a certain region, the color on the canvas changes, like a work of art evolving and transforming. It's a symphony of shapes and colors, guided by mathematics and randomness.\n\nAs the show progresses, the digital world comes to life, creating a unique visual and artistic experience. It's an ever-evolving work of art, a harmony between the precision of mathematical rules and the freedom of artistic expression. As spectators of this digital performance, we can only grasp a taste of this ephemeral beauty, a fleeting moment in this ethereal dance of data and forms.\n\nI used p5.js and the algorithm I created Flow3.js (of which I report an example).\nCanvas 4000x5000 (after several tests it was considered the best for the job).\nPress P to save as png \npress J to save as jpeg\n\nKisses\nKenzo",

            "description": "This series explores the remnants and imprints of past events; the unintended consequences and marks left behind: The floor of a painter's studio, layered with splatters and spills; the face of a rock, sculpted by the relentless touch of water and ice; the rusty hood of a forsaken car, weathered and chipped under the harsh sun.\n\nThe art piece is crafted by an algorithm simulating the effects of abrasion from a consistent yet dynamic process. It links a thousand pairs of points, harmoniously shifting across the canvas, with delicate lines. At each intersection of these lines, color is applied. To produce the final piece, multiple layers of varying colors and intensities are superimposed.\n\n------\n\nControls:\n\n- [x] Save a PNG\n\n- [1] Set height to 768\n- [2] Set height to 1152 \n- [3] Set height to 1536 (default)\n- [4] Set height to 2304\n- [5] Set height to 3072* \n- [6] Set height to 6144*\n- [7] Set height to 9216*\n- [8] Set height to 11520*\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render height\n\n\n* images with height over 3000 pixels render without animating, downloads a PNG automatically after rendering\n\nPlease note that high resolution outputs will take several minutes or even longer to render.
