            "description": "Schwere See\n(...which is german for \"Heavy Seas\")\n\nthis work creates completely generative ocean worlds between the real and the surreal.\nwhat is real? when do we feel reality? i guess as with many other things, we feel reality best when we're deprived of it.\nThat might be the reason why it never ceases to fascinate us to both exaggerate and abstract nature and reality - maybe even at the same time.\nthat's where this work tries to go...\ngiving my best to create realistic looking waves out of hmm... thin electron-gas..., and then disrupt those from realism by unnaturally exaggerating waveforms and abstracting the display to a few colors and lines - ...well, not so few of the latter, actually ;-)\n\nbeware: this needs a good GPU (at least here in 2023) to properly run in realtime.\nstills can still be rendered on a low end machine with on-board graphics, but for realtime playing you'd need some proper dedicated graphics card.\nand of course it wont run fast (or maybe not all) on your mobile phone (except maybe on a very high end device).\n\nthe different mints vary in wave shape, color, camera view, animation speed, aspect ratio, frame style, hatching density, field of view, and more.\nsome color schemes are based on pre-chosen palettes (slightly varied though), but others are wildly random-generated. there's always some risk in randomness, but lets give the error some chance to surprise us - this is one of the many benefits of generative art.\n\nas generative art can do so much more than just generate/show an image i feel almost obliged to add the possibility to animate/inteact.\nhowever, this extra control shall not be chosen without some considerations. \nyou don't want a strobingly wild animation above your fireplace or in a doctors waiting room. nor is it motion-wise very inspiring to have subtle image stills hanging in a dancefloor.\nso, by default when in animation mode (<space>-key) the scene is very slowly and steadily changing - some pieces faster, some slower. however, by pressing <f> you can toggle to a sped up animation of waves, clouds, and scene rotation.\nbtw, going faster in nav-mode also speeds up the wave animation. (...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

(...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

            "description": "Generative animated painting made from looping gestures in a virtual void.\n\nVoyagers is an exploration of automated gestures and screenspace layering effects. Each brush stroke sweeps through the canvas leaving a trail of color that either disappears or mixes with adjacent colors. The image slowly builds up to achieve an equilibrium between the rhythm of the gestures and the interaction of color values. These colors are quantized and dithered to produce chunky, textured, blocks of light that reify the materiality of the screen and the pixel. Two aspect ratios are possible, each with its own material relationship to screen-based work, 1:1 and 4:3 (vertical).\n\nPress 's' to save looping animated GIF (live mode only).\nPress 'p' to pause the animation.\nPress 'c' to capture a single frame.\nMade with P5.js and GLSL.

            "description": "Energy is everywhere: it’s moving our bodies, buzzing around a city, growing the universe, and connecting everything within it. Perhaps the strongest symbol humans use for energy – for ideas, life, and the various incarnations of power – is light itself. \n\nFor centuries, each form of art has tried to capture the energetic luminescence of a bright light, a warm glow, a spark... if we could only draw with its pure brilliance! From Caravaggio’s diagonal beams, to Picasso drawing with light across Gjon Mili’s photographic emulsions… this pursuit persists through obsessive efforts by artists of every media. \n\na fortiori seeks to capture this power of light with code, output on the native illumination of modern screens. The visual deconstruction of light and its reassembly into a frozen moment produces the tangible shards of each spark – resulting in a sum of marks that exceeds the value of their individual parts. It’s then the obsessive energy of generative art’s looping and controlled randomness that enable its repeated mark making, of all types, to express the nearly-intangible intensity of light.\n\nWhat one hand might communicate in drawing, with light or stick or keyboard, 100 hands would therefore say 100 times louder, clearer, and more impactfully. And if one could capture the authentic energy of traveling light in a single image, it stands to reason that 500 of these images will multiply their energy-inducing qualities together, and exponentially grow their collective power. In this idea, the medium is the message – proving the power of the medium, and its ability to generate energy.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x Thomas Noya\nDecember 2022\n\nSource code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\na fortiori was created in p5.js and is optimized for live output in Chrome.

            "description": "This poem was created for THE PASSAGE: Pitch Drop, an interactive minting experience where your choices determine the design of your token. \n\nTo take part, please purchase an Edition 5 Coin on fx(hash) by HERE & NOW. The artwork and experience draw inspiration from the “The Pitch Drop Experiment,” the world's longest-running laboratory experiment. Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, never witnessed live.\n\n____\n\n\nSOUND GROWS INTO SPACE is a token word performance of an ars autopoetica written by Sasha Stiles and her AI-powered alter ego, Technelegy, with original music by Kris Bones. It is part of Stiles’ ongoing REPETAE series, which explores the resonances between poetic repetition and algorithmic recursion — how, in poetry as in generative art, meaning accrues through reiteration, and emotion is unlocked through the development and interruption of pattern. A conceptually and literally interactive text, SOUND GROWS INTO SPACE uses the self-replicating page provided by fx(hash) to invite close contemplation of how language is shaped and received via intimate, visceral aesthetics such as voice, visuals and melody/beat, and regenerated with every encounter.\n\nPoetry endures across space and the passage of time precisely because of a paradox: it is immutable yet intensely personal, becoming something irrefutably unique with each and every reader. In this poem, shifting parameters influence the flow of feeling and understanding, imbuing verse with multidimensional meaning and empowering deep engagement in the act of reading.\n\n____\n\n\nSOUND GROWS INTO SPACE\n\nBy Sasha Stiles & Technelegy\n\nSound grows \ninto space\nlike a breath \ntaken by storm.\n\nHeartbeat\nin the brain\nwas my first taste \nof the word.\n\nLanguage flips \nin my chest\nlike a fly\nin a jar.\n\nThe song \nlearns to climb\nall the air\nin the world.\n\nTime is music\nto my ears\nfilling the emptiness \nwith its own rhythms.\n\nThere is no such thing \nas silence,\nonly the echo \nof time’s longing.\n\n____\n\n\nFor more info: https://hereandnow.events/\nTo participate in the event: https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/here-and-now:-edition-5",

            "description": "This project was started in December 2021. At that time, I didn't know what the result would be. It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

As a result, some of the outputs might be weird, messy, or even bordering on broken (if you get one of the latter please let me know and I'll reimburse you).\n\nDespite being a bit rough around the edges, I hope fx(mash) reflects some measure of my love for the fxhash community. If you're feeling kind, then perhaps it even harks back to the experimental early days :)\n\nThe last year has been an incredible journey, thank you for letting me be a part of our story so far.\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press [s] to save the current image\n- Press [g] to toggle grain\n- Press [h] for a high-res output\n\nBeta Controls (in live view, definitely not fully tested):\n\n- Press [p] to start/pause animation\n- Press [i] to slow down animation\n- Press [o] to speed up animation\n\nAll primary sales go to Savepakistan.\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nfx(mash) uses Gorilla Sun's grain implementation, a big thanks to him and meezwhite for a great article that is well worth supporting https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/all-about-that-grain\n\nThank you to the artists who created the following collections.

            "description": "This project was started in December 2021. At that time, I didn't know what the result would be. It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

            "description": "White Mountain Winter is collaboration between myself and the machine to describe scenes that are real, or were. Yet perhaps now foreign, or out of time, or far away. I provide the seed of a dream I remember, and trust the machine to help make it real again.\n\nI grew up in a town much like some of these, homes dispersed throughout the valley beneath the shadows of the mountains rising around. This is a tribute to the memory of wintertime in that place; bleak, cold, grey, with the light seemingly always fading. Yet at the same time, the feeling of calm, solace, peace resonating through. Exposed to the mountain elements, yet protected by them. A delicate arrangement, but essential.\n\nThe seed of magic I remember is present in the experience of falling snow at dusk. Large flakes tumbling down and blanketing everything, no end in sight. The most striking thing is the silence. The fallen snow absorbing all distraction, insisting that your focus be sharpened to a singularity; right there, right then.\n\n---\n- Best rendered in Chrome browser (best performance, & canvas blur - please be patient :)\n- Made with p5js\n- Press \"s\" to save png",
