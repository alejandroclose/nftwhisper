            "description": "\"the Pazyryk\"\n\"In the years 1326 to 1328 of the Solar Hijri calendar (equivalent to 1947–1949 AD), during a time when the Pazyryk carpet, the world's oldest known carpet, was discovered by Sergei Rudenko, a Russian archaeologist, in the Pazyryk Valley. This woolen carpet, adorned with vibrant colors, depicts images of horse riders, grazing deer, and mythical creatures.\n\nIn 'the Pazyryk' collection, inspired by the Pazyryk carpet and the exquisite artistry of carpets and kilims from the eastern regions, an exceptional display of the essence of color in abstract art has emerged. This collection has transformed into a comprehensive exhibition of timeless historical and artistic endeavors, offering viewers an innovative and profound experience through a wide spectrum of colors and artistic creativity.\n\nThe Pazyryk collection has been meticulously designed using 153 different color palettes and three distinct sizes with high resolution suitable for printing. This collection aims to present the colors, essence, and art of the eastern regions to the audience. Each color palette acts as a testimony to the amalgamation of emotions and insights of prominent artists throughout art history. Every color palette has been meticulously derived from the works of these famous artists, representing a fusion of interpretation and personal perspective. These palettes convey an abstract representation of artistic and technological trends, where color and coding techniques blend harmoniously.\n\nBy merging historical art with contemporary innovations, The Pazyryk reflects a living connection between the history of art and contemporary artistic currents. In this piece, I have endeavored to provide the audience with an abstract bridge for a deeper understanding of new art and creativity. Just as sunlight rapidly and captivatingly reflects off stained glass windows of eastern palaces, spreading a unique tapestry of light and shadow on the walls and floors, The Pazyryk conveys a distinctive experience of art and history through the rare abstraction of color and light. Each color palette simultaneously encapsulates a visualization of history and contemporary reflections, inviting us to a mesmerizing celebration of colors and forms.\n\n-\"To propagate the essence of My wonderful community, 50% of the royalty from each secondary sale will be attributed to minters.\"\n\nNOTE: \"This code follows a complex algorithm for its creation, so you may need to wait a bit for each result to load. I'm confident that an intriguing outcome is awaiting you.\"\nPress 's': Export PNG image (current output scale)\n\nCreated with p5.js in August 2023 by @ChistAi.💙",

            "description": "Strands of memory are twisted and entangled with each other, blending in and out with the surrounding fog of chaos. Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

We as humans have a need to leave traces - stories - that others can read and learn from. What will be the traces machines want to leave? This piece employs sinusoidal signals drawn with lines as a simple metaphor for every trace and every language, for every message and every communication.\n\necologías-A is an entity that is part of a broader ecology. Released on occasion of the show \"Unbound - Ecology in the Age of Machines\" at Unit London. The data generated by this entity is read by a different piece minted on Ethereum, creating a link between Tezos and Ethereum, a metaphor for an ecology of blockchains.\n\nit shares a common element with two other works released on fxhash: ecologías B and ecologías C, all of them contributing data to aforementioned pieces.\n\nread more at https://www.iillucid.com/ecologias\n\n15% of primary sales are donated to institutions working towards improving biodiversity and environmental efforts.\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nBuilt on p5.js, glsl\n\nappend &pd=N (N a number) to the URL in live view to increase/decrease resolution\npress s to save current image in current resolution\npress z,x,g,b,n followed by +/- to increase/decrease, respectively, brightness, contrast, gamma, blur, noise",

            "description": "In a world of endless information flow, we can only rely on our feelings and intuition.\nThis work does not carry a complex intellectual concept or a serious semantic load. On the contrary, it is created to give the viewer the opportunity to stop thinking and devote some time to their feelings. Visually, it consists of color fields created with the help of code, which change their position on the screen and flow into each other in their own rhythm. Their forms are completely abstract, and the colors are contrasting. They capture and relax the attention of the viewer,        communicating with the unconscious.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, the project is webgl shaders, which use trigonometric functions and parameters passed from javascript for the creation of color fields and mixing it in a feedback loop with previous frames. The project doesn't use any third party code, libraries or external dependencies. This work includes 11 different composition mods, each of them variable in terms of the shape and arrangement of colors on the screen and has different transitions between color channels and color states. Before being rendered to the screen, the image passes through a feedback filter, which also has several settings for light channels and data processing speed. This all creates a wide variety of possible iterations.\n\nControls:\n\np - pause mode;\n[] - moving frames in a pause mode;\ni/rclick - day/night mode switch;\nd - description;  \ns - save the image;\n2-5 - change canvas resolution;\n\nThe artwork is created by MCHX and llai.59.\n",

Playing with the subtlety and rhythm of colors, shapes and textures.\n\nThis work was inspired by the textures of monotype prints and those of metal engraving. Especially in the geometric marks made by the inking roller while stretching the graphic ink to make a manual printing. It is a tribute to the visuality of handmade prints.\n\n\"Monotipia\" means monotype printing in Portuguese. It is a graphic printing process that results in a single copy. Here I make a parallel between monotype printing and the code+hash minting process, which also produces a single image.\n\n---\nFeatures:\n-> 15 composition schemes\n-> 51 handpicked base colors\n-> 3 canvas formats:  \n-----> Portrait (vertical) \n-----> Square \n-----> Landscape (horizontal)\n-> 3 element tones options: \n-----> Light Texture & Shapes\n-----> Light Texture / Dark Shapes \n-----> Dark Texture & Shapes\n\n---\nTo save the image as a png file, type:\n[1] save at actual size \n[2] save with 2000px height\n[3] save with 3000px height\n[4] save with 4000px height\n[5] save with 5000px height\n\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n---\nCreated with p5.js\n\n---\nThis is my first project on FX(hash) and I would like to express my special thanks to Janaina Selva, Dmarchi, Gyo and Morbeck for their support and for following the step-by-step development of this work, always contributing with a critical eye and great suggestions. I also thank the help from the FX(hash) community on Discord.\n\n---\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2023\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada",

            "description": "## PROJECT DESCRIPTION\n\nWhat is it like to be a sea turtle in the age of plastic?\n\nOur global addiction to single-use plastic is destroying our marine environment. Over 11 million metric tons of waste plastic enter our oceans every year. Thankfully, there is a growing force of ocean defenders rising to combat this crisis. Activists and non-profit organizations around the world are working diligently to solve the ocean plastic problem — but they don’t have nearly enough resources to succeed. This project aims to help.\n\nTurtle Vision uses code, chaos, and regl.js to offer us a glimpse into the experience of a sea turtle in 2023, struggling to survive in an ailing ocean. Turtles prey heavily on jellyfish, but have trouble distinguishing them from the countless plastic bags clogging our oceans given their similar shapes and movement patterns. Because of this, we are finding more and more sea turtles dead on beaches, having starved to death with bellies full of plastic bags.\n\nWe believe that generative art can help to reverse this trend and restore sea turtle populations to pre-plastic levels. Turtle Vision aims to raise money for 5 Gyres, one of the foremost nonprofit groups in the war on single-use plastic. 5 Gyres has a storied pedigree in this space, and has also emerged as a leader amongst conservation organizations in its embrace of blockchain technology.\n\nThis project is a collaboration between renowned generative artist @s_r_r_z, the creator of the iconic Generative Octopuses, and @Casson.tez, a professional ocean conservation activist who works at the intersection of environmentalism and web3.\n\nWe are grateful for the support of Tender.art, fx(hash), TZAPAC, the Tezos Foundation, and the entire Tezos community.\n\n\n## EDITION\n\n- Series size: 534 (it's SEA)\n- Price: 111-99-77-55-33\n- Charity share: 40% of primaries, 5% of secondaries\n\n\n## TECHNICALS\n\nVisuals:\nThis artwork portrays jellyfish intermixed with litter in the ocean, such as plastic bags and masks.

Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",
