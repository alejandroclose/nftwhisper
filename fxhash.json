            "description": "This token generates a deterministic set of minimal, abstract buildings of varying widths, heights, transparencies, and patterns, assembling a skyline view of your own unique imaginary city. Each city comes with its own randomized city day.\n\nEach mint has a native setting (Day or Night) which combined with the current time of viewing influences real-time movements of celestial bodies in your mint, e.g. on a mint with the Day setting, the sun will only appear when viewed during the day. The piece will re-render every minute.\n\nThe individual strokes of this token feature some of my latest developments of an algorithm that generatively simulates the texture of print imperfections. They are randomized at each render to give it a unique character. Note that depending on the complexity of each mint, some renders may introduce a brief pause. The aesthetics are greatly inspired by plotter art of early computer artists such as 'City Painting' by Grace C. Hertlein.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Nov 2021\nArtist: @Yazid",

The tip of the triangle is the uterus which makes the space grow.\n-- LIA DREI (Diaries, 2004)\n\nMy paintings have no past, they are empty of meaning in the present, but await the discussions of the future, as remotely as possible.\nAnd this is why they don't have their feet firmly planted in the ground, although there are invisible roots that take life from the earth, like so many blades of grass.\nWhile I work I look for the truth in what I do. The time is not yesterday because it would be false, it is not today because the emotion takes my breath away and I die every moment and am reborn after every new brushstroke.\nSoon after, time becomes old, useless, meaningless. I never know what will come out with the next brushstroke or spatula stroke.\nMy thoughts go at supersonic speed and only stop to choose another color. The one just painted is never the right one. So I live the life of the new painting with the sense of mystery that the moonless night has. (…)\n-- LIA DREI (Notes, 1962)\n\n----\n\nI never talk about myself.\n\nI'm not creative.\nI blatantly steal other people's art.\nI'm a bad coder, I copy, paste, mix ideas.\nI often ruin it, degrade it.\nBut I always make it mine what I like.\n\nI absorb.\n\n-- ALESSANDRO FIORE (fxhash, 2024)\n\n\n—————\n\nThe work is created responsive by default and it will adapt to the browser window. It will change (even consistently in some cases) based on the screen aspect ratio.\n\nKey commands:\n\n1 = Square 2000x2000\n2 = Square 4000x4000\n3 = Square 6000x6000 (Dependent on your browser limitations, tested on Safari (Mac))\np = Portrait 1500x2115\nl = Landscape 2115x1500\ne = Responsive/Default\nf = Fullscreen\ns = Save as image\n\n\nSee LICENSE.txt in live view for licensing details.\n",

            "description": "As I first embarked on this project during my time abroad, my focus was on isometric projection, using the precise depiction of cubes to reflect the order and tranquility I found there. But as I returned, the foundations of what I once called home began to shake. Places and people I had known for so long now seemed foreign, leaving me with a sense of longing and emotional distress.\n\nThis realization marked a significant turning point in this piece and it took on a chaotic demeanor, with everything disintegrating and falling apart. While grappling with this newfound sense of dislocation, I found myself struggling to make sense of the world around me, searching for meaning and purpose in a place that had become unrecognizable.\n\n“asunder” documents my journey from a state of ease and belonging to one of mental turmoil, lamenting the fleeting moments that slipped away while also conveying optimism for a more promising future.\n\n/////\n\nPress “1”:\t5K px (with texture)\nPress “2”: \t7.5K px (with texture)\nPress “3”: \t10K px (without texture)\nPress “4”: \t12.5K px (without texture)\nPress “5”: \t15K px (without texture)\nPress “6”: \t17.5K px (without texture)\n-> These will automatically export a png + jpg after the simulation is done.\n\n“p” to export a png.\n“j” to export a jpg.\n\nOn mobile: Tap and hold canvas for 2 sec. to export a png with 2.5K px.\n\n“f” to enter fullscreen mode.\n“h” to render a hi res version in full screen mode.\n\nMake sure your browser's zoom level is set to 100% (or play around with different zoom levels :)\nNote that in the fullscreen mode, the overall composition adapts to the screen size in order to maintain a visual appeal across all aspect ratios. Performance and appearance may vary depending on the size/resolution of your screen.",
