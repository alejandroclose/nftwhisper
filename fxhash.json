I felt like I'm completely dissolving in it and turning into zero.\n\nI was getting older and exploring the world around me. What seemed large and complex turned out to be the result of the interaction of simple elements. Even the infinite Universe can be decomposed and understood.\n\n“Zero-player game” is a cellular automaton through which I explore the concept of infinity and emergence. The game starts with a surface covered by random cells. Over six iterations the image becomes more complex as the cells divide and change their colors according to a set of thirty two rules.\n\nMore information about the project at https://ivandianov.com/zero-player-game/\n\n- Swipe or use arrow keys to navigate.\n- Add ?lat=100500&lon=100500 to URL and teleport to a distant location.\n- Press “S” to save a picture.",

Caustic Obstacles uses progressive monte carlo rendering, meaning that at first the image will appear noisy, but over time it will become smoother. It may take up to several minutes for the noise to become unnoticeable (or longer, if you specify a very high resolution). The piece is never officially \"done\" rendering, but instead becomes asymptotically smoother with time - take your screenshots whenever you feel it's smooth enough!\n\nUse the url \"width\" parameter to change the resolution of the piece, e.g. \"/?width=2160\". Every edition is rendered in a 5x7 aspect ratio, and the height will be determined automatically based on the width specified. This means that the height will be determined with the formula width * 7 / 5, rounded up. By default the width is 1080, which results in a height of 1512, while a width of, for example, 2160, would result in a height of 3024.\n\n\n\n–––––––\nTENDER x ella\nDecember 2023  \nCaustic Obstacles is a generative art series created by Ella Hoeppner in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n–––––––",

            "description": "An exploration of algorithmic organisms in a contained environment.\n\nThis piece is about the simulation of microscopic patterns using a high number of even tinier agents all following the same rules. Different species evolve and interact together, resulting in stabilizing patterns out of their parametric configurations. A form of artificial life.\n\nThis work is based on the paper \"Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks\", written by Jeff Jones and popularized in the artistic field by Sage Jenson. Some features were added to increase the visual and behavioral complexity of the system. Agents are divided into different species, with their own set of rules and interacting with their own substrate. Substrates also interact with each other and agents will mutate in contact of some of them.\n\nNFT License\nRuns properly on Chrome 97.0.4692.99\nGPU intensive\n\nPress P to pause (double tab touch devices)\nPress",

            "description": "In Between\n\nGenuary is an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things, with 31 prompts to base your code art off. Genuary 2023 took place during the month of January 2023. Afterwards, as it happens, comes Genuary 32nd. This is an imaginary week, during which we develop one of our Genuary pieces into a 32 edition \"not very long\"-form generative project on fx(hash).\n\nMy Genuary 32nd project is based on Genuary 22nd: Shadows, the design of which again was based on the \"art deco\" pattern from day 20.\n\nThe patterns form a grid-like fence structure, dividing the space and creating an infinite cage. Light coming from the outside casts stark shadows on the floor. Several variations on halftoning techniques are used to portray tone, occasionally destroying depth perception into an abstract interplay of form.\n\nThe code of this piece has been diminished into a mere 3397 characters.\n\nYou can use the URL-parameter &m=2 as a resolution multiplier, to render images larger than your screen.\n\n(c) 2023 by Piter Pasma. https://piterpasma.nl",

            "description": "Our lives are like a rich tapestry of interconnected moments, emotions, and decisions that weave and evolve through space and time. These experiences meld together, forming the intricate fabric of our being, shaping our perspectives, and influencing our sense of self, identity, and worldview. Within this elaborate lattice of life, the delicate threads that fill the interstitial spaces illuminate our existence's fluid and ever-changing dynamics.\n\n\"Liminalia\" is an abstract generative art collection that celebrates these liminal moments and spaces that define us, embracing the beauty of imperfection, transformation, and the interrelation of human experiences. The collection employs abstract visual language to portray the delicate balance between randomness and structure, emphasising the significance of our perception of time in shaping these elements and our individual experiences.\n\nThe collection explores life's complexity through the interwoven colours and picture planes that create fluid spaces and in-between zones. With an appreciation for natural surfaces and organic processes, such as erosion, ageing, and patina formation, the collection emphasizes interconnectedness through an organic aesthetic. The carefully designed colour palettes, inspired by various events and phenomena, capture the essence of time and enhance the liminal themes explored throughout the collection.\n\nThrough its harmonious blend of colour, form, and space, \"Liminalia\" explores the subtle junctures where time, nature, and personal development meet and interact. The collection fosters a dialogue between art, science, and the enigmatic mysteries of our existence, underlining the ties between humans and the ever-evolving beauty of the natural world. Consequently, it imparts a sense of optimism, prompting self-reflection and contemplation, and encourages us to appreciate the inherent charm of time's rhythm and the interdependence of all things.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nfx(params)\nLiminalia has recently introduced the fx(params) system, allowing initial minters greater engagement and influence over the final artwork. This innovative system lets you to personalize the final output while exposing the algorithm to greater scrutiny. As a token of appreciation, 20% of the royalties go to the minter.\n\nFor more information on Liminalia's core themes, creative process, and key parameters, see my recently published article at https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/liminalia.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical\nMade with P5JS and Chroma.js\nOptimized and best viewed in Chrome.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nResolution and Printing\nLiminalia is best experienced in print, providing an immersive and detailed view of the intricate details, rich colour palettes and dynamic interplay of themes.\n\nControls in live mode\n# Press [1] - [5] to change the resolution.\n# Press [s] or [j] to save as PNG or JPEG at the current resolution\nHigh res [5] will output a 10,500px x 16,000px image.\nPlease note that the rendering is processed in 3 main steps, and the filters applied at the end may take a few minutes to render for very high resolution.\n\nTo track the progress of the rendering process, access the development console in your desktop browser.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nLicense\nThis project is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAcknowledgements\nA big shout-out to everyone who pitched in on this project; your input and effort were invaluable.
