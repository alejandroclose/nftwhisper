            "description": "This is the second in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nThis work is a mark of progress. Christopher Scussel and I are working on modernizing MINI-EXPLOR. Chris is working on updating the engine from the original FORTRAN code of the 1970’s and its other limitations to usable JavaScript. In concert, I am analyzing and synthesizing the capabilities of the code and identifying an aesthetic. Together we continue to update EXPLOR and add new features.\n\nCPoSOP Composition is an original derivative work of Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids that was one of Knowlton’s original test examples. (Example 3)\n\nThe original EXPLOR picture frame was limited to a fixed array of 140 x 140 “characters.” Chris has rewritten the code to make the picture space variable. In this piece I increased the image space to a resolution 250 x 250  picture cells. Each picture cell is a 3x3 pixel block. \n\nThe EXPLOR functions are designed to interact with the current contents of each cell in the picture array. Every EXPLOR function has a rules parameter. In this test I’ve added a background. Thus when I draw my modified CPoSOP widget over the background it interacts with the color contents of a background cell or, the color of the cell based on a previously drawn widget.\n\nI’ve modified the original CPoSOP code and replaced constants with random variables. (made it a Spatial Force). I create a regular grid (Form of Spatial Organization) of a random size and draw the CPoSOP widget 85% of the time in one of the grid elements positions. The grid provides a structure to the image and the CPoSOP widget provides visual interest. The interaction of the widgets with the background and each other are amazing. \n\nIn keeping true to an EXPLOR vibe we use 4 color palettes. We let the computer randomly pick from three predefined palettes: Black and white. Four colors randomly chosen from set of 8 “Bauhaus” colors. And, four truly random colors.\n\nWe continue to honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT series. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored now updated by Scussel and Kolomyjec. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history with a modern twist.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Everyday we move on by relying on our convictions. Their immutability often helps us take decisions or take shelter but can sometimes clash with the unknown, the different and the new. They can then crack, crumble and mutate. To change your convictions means changing the kind of person you want to be. It means changing your self-identity. And that is not just hard, it is scary. And beautiful.\n\nMorphing Convictions is a piece that exists through two kind of outputs : Posters and Scenes. Posters are focusing on the contemplation of details and movements of a morphing conviction while the Scenes are interactive little worlds where you can explore a conviction in it's environment.\n\nPlease open in live mode to enjoy a much better experience.\n\nControls :\n\nPosters & Scenes\n• Click anywhere to enable audio.\n• Press M to toggle mute.\n• Press F to toggle the fullscreen mode.\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\nScenes only\n• Drag and scroll to rotate and zoom.\n• Click on objects, some might react.\n\n———————\n\nMorphing Convictions by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "Everyday we move on by relying on our convictions. Their immutability often helps us take decisions or take shelter but can sometimes clash with the unknown, the different and the new. They can then crack, crumble and mutate. To change your convictions means changing the kind of person you want to be. It means changing your self-identity. And that is not just hard, it is scary. And beautiful.\n\nMorphing Convictions is a piece that exists through two kind of outputs : Posters and Scenes. Posters are focusing on the contemplation of details and movements of a morphing conviction while the Scenes are interactive little worlds where you can explore a conviction in it's environment.\n\nPlease open in live mode to enjoy a much better experience.\n\nControls :\n\nPosters & Scenes\n• Click anywhere to enable audio.\n• Press M to toggle mute.\n• Press F to toggle the fullscreen mode.\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\nScenes only\n• Drag and scroll to rotate and zoom.\n• Click on objects, some might react.\n\n———————\n\nMorphing Convictions by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "by Daeinc\nMay 2022\n\nAn exploration into time and motion. Two linear timelines - structural and surficial - are intertwined. By weaving these timelines at different points in time, almost infinite variations can be made. The changing relationship between the two creates dynamic and unique compositions and challenges the visual perception.\n\n## Guide:\n- Please note that the animation responds to window aspect ratio. This is an intentional behavior as part of interactivity. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- To export image at specific size, use URL parameters as below.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.3.1 with Chrome 101.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction:\n- [0] for exhibit. it switches to a different mode every 3 loops.\n- [s] to export PNG image. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause animation\n- [1 ~ 5] for different play modes\n- [1]: all \n- [2]: surficial \n- [3]: constant \n- [4]: all-constant\n- [5]: structural\n- [h] to toggle hi-DPI mode. (for retina display)\n\n## URL Parameters:\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&mode=exhibit&w=800&st=5.3\n- [mode]: play mode (exhibit, all, surficial, constant, all-constant, structural)\n- [w]: width. (ex. w=1200)\n- [h]: height. (ex. h=600)\n- [st]: structural timecode. up to 2 decimals (ex. st=4.31)\n- [su]: surficial timecode. up to 2 decimals (ex. su=15.04)\n- [co]: constant offset. up to 2 decimals (ex. co=7.4)\n- [pr]: pixel ratio. set it to 2 (or press [h]) for hi-DPI screens.\n\n## License\nCC-BY-NC 4.0\nPlease refer to the included LICENSE.md for license information.\nLibraries used: p5, canvas-sketch, canvas-sketch-util, keyframes, easing equations from easings.net",
