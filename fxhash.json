            "description": "Errance - an exploration of abstract and digital glitch fusion. The algorithm crafts the concept and structure, while randomness navigates the detailed textures, exploring the interplay between systematic design and the unforeseen aspects of randomness. Errance represents a journey of discovery, one without a defined endpoint, capturing the unexpected and fortuitous outcomes that emerge as algorithms navigate freely, leaving a trail of unique and unpredictable patterns.\n\nBest experienced in live mode at high resolution, the outputs vary significantly due to multiple features, occasionally favouring a slightly asymmetric balance. Under the hood, the algorithm employs a combination of recursive functions, 3D primitives, and multiple textures derived from trigonometric and noise functions using p5.js. Last but not least, during rendering, the outputs are enhanced by one of several versions of a GLSL shader.\n\nIn live mode:\n-press 1 to save a 2K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 2 for a 4K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 3 to render a version without passepartout.\n-press 4 for a 2k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.\n-press 5 for a 4k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.",

            "description": "m0-n0 is a realtime generative artwork, composed of deconstructed screen space. The process is based on a recursive noise function, that is altered by low-level manipulations of a fragment shader. The sound synthesis is closely related with the glitches and flaws of the unfolding image architecture. Each colour scheme activates a different set of sound generators and filter modules. The resulting composition is an audiovisual environment that slowly transforms its elements into a blend of auditive sensations and autonomous pixel configurations.\n\nm0-n0 is part of the fxhash and RefractionDAO live minting experience at the Tezos South Beach Miami exhibition on December 6th, 2023.\n\nTouch to start audio",

            "description": "The third and final installment of the Self trilogy.\n\nEgo is defined as: the one of the three divisions of the psyche in psychoanalytic theory that serves as the organized conscious mediator between the person and reality especially by functioning both in the perception of and adaptation to reality.\n\nPlease see attached fx(text) article or go to https://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy for more on concept/mechanics/etc. It’s a bit of long read, but worth it.\n\nThis is an fx(params) project and you will be able to choose exactly what your iteration will look like. For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM.

            "description": "My favourite subjects are often simple questions that we ask ourselves since our first teeth. Classics like: before-after, your left or mine, me or not-me, etc\n\nThis work, though, is not about binary opposites but about their generators. The sources of the categories that have only two members, both existing solely as the negation or absence of the other. You can face it as heady philosophical stuff or a Sesame Street segment, either way, it's inspiring.\n\nCurrently am hopping on the leg that here's no \"third actor\" in play but actually the two counterparts themselves. The existance of one, immediately spawning the existance of the other, the not-this-one.\n\nWhen a river spawns its two unmistakeable sides do so too; every place is an inside and an outside; Houses and boxes and teams and eggs.\n\n\"Something and anything but\" would be a great title but not exactly what I'm exploring here.\n\nThis work isn't about explaining -nothing at all- but actually the result of using some common \"divisors\" as sources for generative outputs.\n\nUsing a homemade recipe that mixes equal parts of ballpen scribbles, thin pen lines and, of course, thread, 2fold is my attempt at illustrating these modest but fertile concepts.\n\nHope you appreciate it.

Mints that have a prime numbers* as factors will have slight variations. Sometimes those variations will combine, sometimes you have to get to really high numbers for multiple prime numbers to combine.\n\nWhere the finally Tally! ends up who knows? But there's going to be a lot of tallying along the way, and it'll give you something to do while waiting between other mints.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::\n\n'?forceWidth=xxxx' on the end of the URL to change the width of the image\n's' = save image\n",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

            "description": "Errance - an exploration of abstract and digital glitch fusion. The algorithm crafts the concept and structure, while randomness navigates the detailed textures, exploring the interplay between systematic design and the unforeseen aspects of randomness. Errance represents a journey of discovery, one without a defined endpoint, capturing the unexpected and fortuitous outcomes that emerge as algorithms navigate freely, leaving a trail of unique and unpredictable patterns.\n\nBest experienced in live mode at high resolution, the outputs vary significantly due to multiple features, occasionally favouring a slightly asymmetric balance. Under the hood, the algorithm employs a combination of recursive functions, 3D primitives, and multiple textures derived from trigonometric and noise functions using p5.js. Last but not least, during rendering, the outputs are enhanced by one of several versions of a GLSL shader.\n\nIn live mode:\n-press 1 to save a 2K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 2 for a 4K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 3 to render a version without passepartout.\n-press 4 for a 2k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.\n-press 5 for a 4k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.",

            "description": "Errance - an exploration of abstract and digital glitch fusion. The algorithm crafts the concept and structure, while randomness navigates the detailed textures, exploring the interplay between systematic design and the unforeseen aspects of randomness. Errance represents a journey of discovery, one without a defined endpoint, capturing the unexpected and fortuitous outcomes that emerge as algorithms navigate freely, leaving a trail of unique and unpredictable patterns.\n\nBest experienced in live mode at high resolution, the outputs vary significantly due to multiple features, occasionally favouring a slightly asymmetric balance. Under the hood, the algorithm employs a combination of recursive functions, 3D primitives, and multiple textures derived from trigonometric and noise functions using p5.js. Last but not least, during rendering, the outputs are enhanced by one of several versions of a GLSL shader.\n\nIn live mode:\n-press 1 to save a 2K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 2 for a 4K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 3 to render a version without passepartout.\n-press 4 for a 2k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.\n-press 5 for a 4k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.",
