            "description": "Action; system is an experimental study inspired by the work of François Morellet. Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "“Raoul Pictor cherche son style…” (Raoul Pictor is looking for his style…) was launched in Saint-Gall, Switzerland, in 1993. It consists of a Mac LC computer, a 12-inch color screen, and an HP 500C printer.\nThe program presents an animation in which we can observe an artist, Raoul Pictor, working in his studio. He paints, paces while deep in thought, consults books from his library, plays the piano, and enjoys red wine. The sequence of these activities is non-linear. The canvas is seen from behind, resting on the easel in the center of the room. We are unable to see what is being painted. Once his painting is complete, he picks it up and exits through a side door. It is at this moment that the printer springs into action, delivering his unique, dated, and signed work.\nThis project has been exhibited in numerous exhibitions around the world. Subsequently, a Flash version, \"Raoul Pictor Web Studio,\" was developed to make it available on the internet (2001). In 2013, for its 20th anniversary, an iOS version, \"Raoul Pictor Mega Painter,\" was developed in collaboration with the great Matthieu Cherubini (mchrbn.net). \nIn 2023, for its 30th anniversary, an update seemed necessary to continue the adventure on the fx(hash) platform – thank you for making all of this possible! The development of this first fx version (“Country Spirit I”) was greatly enhanced by the wonderful support and expertise of the sha22.art team as well as our friends. Additional collections are now planned for the near future or special events...\n\n[up_arrow], [space bar] : Painter jumps in first part of animation.\n\n[p], [mouse click], [touch screen] : Save the painting when it is displayed.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
