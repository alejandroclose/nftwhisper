            "description": "Element is a generative series of pixelated mosaics that explores two contrasting styles of generative art. One style embraces imperfection and noise to simulate paint or other real-life textures, while the other produces digital outputs with precise forms.\n\nThe mosaics were inspired by the works of Hiroshi Kawano, one of the pioneers of generative art. They are generated by randomly placing rectangles inside a grid then applying a Markov-chain process multiple times. A hand-drawn and organic style is then incorporated using various techniques such drawing many rectangles with subtle variations in colour for a paint texture or adding different kinds of noise.\n\nPlease view in full-screen for the best experience.\n\nPress [s] when the output is fully rendered to download it as a png file. The resolution can be set by adding for example \"&s=2048\" to the url for a 2048 x 2048 output.\n\nElement was released as part of the Cure3 exhibition, generating vital funds for Cure Parkinson's medical research.",

To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

            "description": "Lines, our simple geometric friends, are nice and neat ideal forms. Until they’re not. Here they shake, crumble, twist and bend. Just like everything else in our fragile world. We put a lot of faith in lines, from marking out political borders to defining our designs, but maybe they aren’t as reliable as they seem.\n\nIn this work we make small, probing journeys into the space between pure shiny mathematics and the brittle chaos of materiality that this math tries to define. Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.\n\nI like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!\n\nMade with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.\n\nThere’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter. Sometimes unnoticed, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with angst. But always with a kind of truth. And I hope this work can conjure a kind of hazy evocation of all this. The message is only meant to be a feeling, at most.\n\n## Generate a printable version\n\nTo generate a version for printing, add the search parameter `?print=true` to the url. This disables the initial animation and doens't trigger a canvas resize when the window changes size.\n\nYou can then also add your preferred width of canvas by adding a `width` parameter, eg: `?print=true&width=2000`. Depending on your browser there's a limit to the maximum width you can use. Using Chrome on an Apple M1 laptop, I can go up to a width of 4700px, but experiment with what works for you.\n\nOnce the image is ready, press [s] on your keyboard to save as a PNG.\n\nTested in all major browsers on Apple silicon and on windows PC with an Intel chip.",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",
