            "description": "CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG is an homage to Ohne Titel (1969–1970) by Verena Loewensberg.\n\n2 of 5 in CENTURY-XXX, Series 2\nEdition of 128\n\nCENTURY-XXX is a series of software sketches that pay tribute to artists of the 20th century. Each piece is named after a specific artist and reimagines one of their original works through code, often by adding motion, variation, or interactive elements. These sketches don’t replicate the original artworks but instead extend their core ideas into new forms.\n\nBy “software sketch,” I mean something more informal than a finished artwork. While some of my projects take months or even years to complete, these sketches are created quickly—often in just a few days. They may be lighter in process, but they’re equally important to me. Sketching with code is how I think through ideas and discover new directions for future work.\n\nThe project began with the CENTURY exhibition at DAM Projects in Berlin in fall 2012, where I premiered Network C, Network D, and the first Signal to Noise software piece. Since then, these sketches have inspired more full-scale artworks like METASOTO, METAVASARELY, METAMOLNAR (also known as Hommage à Molnar), including the eponymous CENTURY released through Art Blocks in June 2021.\n\nCENTURY-XXX Series 1 was released from December 2021 to January 2022 in editions of 1,000. The first artwork in Series 2 followed in October 2022, also in an edition of 1,000. The remaining four works in Series 2 are scheduled for release starting in 2025, each in smaller editions of fewer than 128 based on what feels appropriate for the individual piece.\n\nThe long-term vision for CENTURY-XXX is to create 100 software sketches, each one inspired by a different artist and artwork from the 20th century.\n\nSERIES 1\n1.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMETAMALEVICH\n1.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMOLNAR(S)\n1.3 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMORELLET\n1.4 — CENTURY-XXX-METARILEY\n1.5 — CENTURY-XXX-METAKELLY\n\nSERIES 2\n2.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE\n2.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG\n\nMore CENTURY-XXX’s to come…",

It does so by representing a glacier that will melt over time, acting as a Countdown for our time left to react to the Climate Crisis.\n\nIf you visit this token every other day, the melting will start to be noticeable, and around one year, most of the ice will be gone. The token will also show signs of pollution: the sky colors will desaturate, stars will be less visible on night palettes, and the ice and water will get dirtier. Lastly, the penguin families will start disappearing, as the ice melts and they lose their home.\n\nAll the information of the token is available on the browser's console (Features + Token evolution).\n\n---------------\n- 365 editions, as the ice will melt almost completely in one year\n- 13 color palettes, with different rarities\n- 3 ice shades\n- Different number of penguin families\n---------------\n\nPress \"s\" to save a 2000x2000px png with the current state of the token\n",

Inspired by the early pioneering work of the concrete poets such as Dom Sylvester Houédard, Ian Hamilton Finley and Steve McCaffe, the project is a play with letters, words and graphic form in the computational and generative space.\n\nEach iteration gives you the possibility to discover a variety of visual form through exploring the system. Please explore your iteration with the key interactions below. It is hoped that you give the time to explore and observe. If you don't, you may end up with just a blank canvas. \n\nThank you for collecting. \n\nKey Interactions\n\n‘a’ activates forward motion on/off\n‘b’ activates backward motion on/off\n‘r’ rotates grid 45° [ rotates on key pressed]\n‘f’ rotates the grid freely [ stops on key release ]\n‘p’ switches grid scale on/off [ this can be CPU heavy on older machines ] \n‘g’ extra glyphs on/off\n‘q’ return to the initial state \n\n\nProgram written by Mark Webster\nFont is copyright ©simonrenaud\n\nareafour.xyz\n@motiondesign_01",

            "description": "A voxel is a unit of graphic information that defines a point in three-dimensional space. \n\nrubikVoxels is a return to the realm of 3D computer graphics. I define a 3D object, a cube, and construct a number of cube instances into an array that floats in 3D space. Each cube consists of 6 faces, each facet colored one of the 6 \"official\" colors of the Rubik's Cube (TM) palette. Hence, each cube (voxel) represents a solved Rubiks Cube (TM) puzzle.\n\nI use a combination of functions to control the rotation of each cube in its relative position in the array. As each cube is rotated you can see its various colored faces. I maintain the cubes' proper visibility by eliminating the facets of the cube that face away from the viewer, i.e., back face culling.\n\nTo quote my collaborator and friend Chris Scussel: \"I just LOVE the secondary patterns created by the gradual turning of the cubes!  The curves appear and disappear as one looks around the image. Interesting and fun!\" \n\n(c)2022 Dr.Bill Kolomyjec. All rights reserved.\n\nPlease visit www.drbillkolomyjec.com",

The Game of Life is a zero-player game, its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.\n\nMaps of Life is a generative-player game, an algorithm that creates an initial random configuration and a collector that observes how the configuration evolves. Each mint produces a distinctly unique cartographic representation of an ideal town, with different color palettes, scales, and coordinates, an animation from its random birth to a stopped moment in time.\n\nMaps of Life assumes that the built environment has a life of its own. And besides, only an automatic mind can name towns with Butterfly Names. Enjoy the view.\n\n---\nInteractivity:\nPress LEFT and RIGHT arrows to speed-up or slow-down the evolution of the town.\nPress \"S\" to save the current state to a PNG image.\nIf you want to change the resolution, just add \"?res=XXX\" to the end of the url.\n---\n\n(With these keys, you can possibly force the script to continue until its further completion.

            "description": "For my first drop on the new fxhash v1.0 I wanted to make something different. So I challenged myself to write a raymarcher like the ones I use in my shaders but in p5.js and make a fully procedural scene with it. It's a bit tricky to work with vectors once you are used to GLSL, but I managed to write a decent algorithm that scans a grid and slowly draws the image. It draws it with circles and triangles for the grass. The first thing I used for testing was a SDF of a plane with some tall bars on it. Then I was trying different distortions on the shapes and in one moment the results gave me the idea of a scene with mushrooms and grass on an undulated terrain. Later I added a small river and a cloudy sky. I think I was inadvertently inspired by some children's books I had when I was a kid. \n\nBest viewed full screen.\n\nFeatures:\n\nMood: happy - normal - melancholic - strange - sleepy\nMushrooms: 2 - 4 (sometimes one of the mushrooms can only be seen on full screen)\nMushroom height: short - medium - tall\nMushroom fatness: S - M - L - XL\nMushroom shape: 1 - 2 - 3- 4 - 5\nMushroom tilt\nFlowers color: white - yellow - pink - cyan - multicolor\nRiver: yes - no\nCamera orientation: north - south",

For nearly all word/phrase blocks in the template system, there exist 512 possible excerpts you could receive, and countless possible combinations thereof. Additionally, 16 possible color palettes, 8 possible fonts, and many bezel types will determine your clock's visual appearance.\n\nUnlike my original 2014 iteration, I wrote this clock in Vanilla JS with zero dependencies. (Largely, that's thanks to eight additional years of programming experience.) As a result, it's faster (once loaded) and more responsive as well.",
