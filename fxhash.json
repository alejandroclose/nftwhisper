By contrast with other plant cultivation practices, bonsai is not intended for production of food or for medicine. Instead, bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of one or more small trees growing in a container.\nI pressume that the main intention is aesthetic. The beauty. Because we love beautiful things.\nIt is very interesting how we modify certain creatures for our sake of satisfaction.\n\nMay this collection brings you good fortune.",

            "description": "The <iframe> HTML element is an element that allows a web document to embed the contents of another web document within itself. iframes are at the core of fxhash. They are portals opening our view to rich content.\n\nThis work is a portal to itself. It loads itself within itself 20 times. It's not pretty, it reminds us of WordArt, it's a little bit hacky, it might break when our tools to display HTML will change. But it's a proof that the limits of our tools are only limits until creativity breaks them.\n\nThis work is not purely deterministic, because it simply cannot be. Slight timing differences due to loading times being different each time an <iframe> is loaded will make each visualization slightly unique.\n\nIf you view this token on mobile, the nesting limit was reduced to 4 to prevent performance issues.\n\nThis work is highly experimental. It leverages a \"hack\" to allow iframes to be nested.\nFirefox max <iframe> nesting depth as of 28/12/2021 is capped at 9.\nWorks with chrome desktop 96.0.4664.110",

Does the journey called research have an end point?\n\nWe are trying to track it via postage stamps for envelopes coming from there.\n\nThanks for the aesthetic inspiration to Sigmar Polke, who lived and studied at the Düsseldorf Arts Academy, not far from our current place of living.\nHis works were called a European Pop art, because of translating everyday life into enigmatic narratives.\nExperimenting with materials and chemicals, mixing together traditional pigments with varnishes, toxins and resins to produce spontaneous chemical reactions, he was making art created by chance. He combined analog alchemy with tinting and altering methods on a computer.\n\nIn our case, alchemy is the images, produced by the neural networks, the results of which cannot be predicted. One can only guess, try to ask them the right question.\n\nChemistry and pigments are p5.js tools that also sometimes spontaneously produce unpredictable results.\n\nThe process of creating ‘Nowhere Stamps’ became a great journey and adventure in itself.\n\nWork is made in collaboration with artist, musician and poet Yulikolay.\n",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch D (Disruption). The grid is broken. The color palette from Sketches A, B, and C remains. Most outputs are simply single colors or black and white. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.\n\nPress the spacebar to see the unDisturbed structure.",
