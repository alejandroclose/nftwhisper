            "description": "“Klyft” is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at PARIS+ par Art Basel.\n\nKlyft is a juxtaposition of two different projections for the future. One, made by the World Economic Forum, suggests that the global gender gap will have closed by the year 2154. The other, by the UN IPCC, estimates that global warming will reach 3.2 degrees celcius by the year 2100.\n\nKlyft makes use of the unique temporal aspect of computational art by developing its expression gradually over the next 132 years. As we come closer to 2154, the space between the two shapes in Klyft will grow smaller to symbolize the closing of the gender gap. As time goes on, however, Klyft also becomes more and more glitched out to represent the projected increases in greenhouse gases and climate catastrophes.\n\nIn the end, Klyft’s expression will be heavily corrupted, and the two shapes will have reached each other.\n\n· URL parameters ·\n\nYou can add the following parameters to the URL to change the behavior of the piece.\n\ndate=<YYYY-MM-DD> — See how Klyft looks on another day. Use the format YYYY-MM-DD. \n\ncolor=<number> — See the piece in another color scheme. The numbers loop around, so 17 equals 0, 18 equals 1, etc. \n\nresolution=<number> — View the piece in a higher resolution. 1 is normal resolution, 2 is double, etc. No decimals allowed.\n\nimage=true — Save the piece as an image. \n\nrecord=true — Save the piece as a video in WEBM format.\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will show Klyft in double resolution on the day gender equality is achieved according to the WEF:\n\ndate=2154-01-01&resolution=2\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will save a video of Klyft in the ‘Stokkendahl Dalgas’ color scheme:\n\ncolor=14&record=true\n\n· Interactions ·\n\nPressing the following keys will trigger functionality as well as add related URL parameters automatically. \n\nPressing D will increment the date by 1 year.\n\nPressing C will increment the color index by 1.\n\nPressing R will toggle between normal and double resolution.\n\nPressing I will toggle the image URL parameter, which saves the piece as an image. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nPressing V will toggle the video URL parameter, which saves the piece as a video. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nThere are secret key presses as well. Some of them only work outside of iframe. \n\n· Accessibility ·\n\nKlyft is built to support screen readers. It has been tested using MacOS’ VoiceOver, and uses p5.js’ describeElement() to provide screen reader functionality.\n\nIf you have any comments (good or bad) on the screen reader integration, don’t hesitate to reach out on my Twitter: @ada_ada_ada_art. \n\n· Credits and license ·\n\nKlyft is made with p5.js.\n\nKlyft is licensed under a modified version of the Climate Strike License (CSL).",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "------------\nIntroduction\n------------\nArgentina is world-renowned for its exquisite wine, and the Malbec grape has long been a celebrated variety. While most of the country’s wine comes from the region of Cuyo, specifically the province of Mendoza, there is another hidden gem that is often overlooked: Entre Rios.\n\nNamed after the two massive rivers that surround it, Entre Rios is a province located in the northeast of Argentina. What many people don’t know is that it boasts a long and fascinating history of wine production that dates back to the early 19th century.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Entre Rios, I had the pleasure of exploring a small vineyard located near the Parana river. As I walked among the vines, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by their vibrant colors, intricate patterns of the leaves, and the beautiful clusters of grapes. It was clear to me that there was something truly special about the vineyards of Entre Rios.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the region’s history, I discovered that until 1937, Entre Rios was one of the largest wine producers in the country, with over 60 vineyards operating in the province. However, a national law was passed that year creating the Regulating Board of Wine, which concentrated and granted exclusivity to wine production in Cuyo. It wasn’t until 1993 that the law was repealed, allowing vineyards to be planted and modified throughout the country.\n\nToday, Entre Rios is home to a small but thriving wine industry that is known for its unique blends and varietals. One of the most notable grapes is the Tannat, which was once the predominant variety in the region.\n\nInspired by the beauty of these vineyards, I decided to create a generative art collection that celebrates the colors, shapes, and textures of the grapes and vines called ‘Lorda’.\n\n\n-----------\nAbout Lorda\n-----------\nTannat originates in southwest France (Madiran). However, it was not very admired there, so Tannat began its journey: it moved to our country, in the trunks of a Basque, Juan Jauregui, and settled in Entre Rios towards the end of the 1800s. This farmer nicknamed “El Lorda” planted Tannat in Concordia and managed to make a quite respectable wine. The grape took that nickname and became known as Lorda.\n\n\n-----\n\nPress \"e\" to save a high res png while in live mode.\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2023)\n\nMade with P5js and <3",

Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch F(ree). A gift to all Sketch A-E collectors. The underlying grid structure from A-E remains, but more variation on size and distribution is added. Many more color palettes are introduced. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.",

It involves drawing intricate designs, typically on the floor, using materials such as colored powders, flowers, and grains. \n\nRangoli is meant to bring prosperity and happiness to a home and can range from simple geometric patterns to more complex depictions of nature.\n\nThe Rangxel tesseracts are created through rule-based instructions, following traditional Rangoli formation principles like symmetry, repeating patterns, and themes, resulting in interconnected, multi-dimensional forms of fragments.\n\nThese monolithic structures also reflect natural 3D grids found in nature such as crystals and honeycombs,presenting a deconstructed, pixelated matrix of our universe. \n\nUltimately, the reality we live in is an abstraction of the algorithm narrated by the creator.\n\n#StayPixelated\n\nControls (){\nDouble click Once to Enable Rotate around Tesseract;\nDouble click Twice to Disable  Rotate;\nDouble click Thrice to Go back original Composition;\nRotate , Zoom , Pan with Touch/Mouse;\n}\n",

            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "As the abandoned sewage planet Xnor lay seemingly dormant, aeons crept by. Erosion and oxidation recombined in plumbing, slowly causing the pipes to evolve sentience and grow to the horizon in a blooming chaos of rust, steel and concrete.\n\nIndustrial Devolution is the first long-form generative project using my rayhatching algorithm. It combines a raymarcher for SDFs with a surface orientation based flow field renderer in order to draw arbitrary 3D scenes as line art, with an organic, hatched drawing style. The SDF formulas were generatively designed and parametrized to form ancient landscapes of corroded industrial pipes and immense, ageless blocks of concrete.\n\nThe entire code of Industrial Devolution is 3930 characters, using no external libraries.\n\nWhen done rendering, the output can be right-click saved as an SVG file and plotted using a plotter such as an Axidraw. The lines in the SVG are in random order, so it is recommended to use a path reordering/optimizing tool such as axicli or vpype before plotting. This will greatly reduce the plotting time. The output SVG is intended to be plotted at A3 (297x420mm) using a 0.4mm black pen (but feel free to experiment). You can change this by adding these options to the URL:\n\n  &lw=.4 the linewidth in millimetres\n  &d=.8 the line density (multiplier to the line width, density 0.6 recommended for plotter output)\n  &h=420 how high the page is, in millimetres (width is always height * 0.707)\n  &bg=1 set to 0 to remove background rectangle (bg=0 recommended for plotter output)\n\nIndustrial Devolution was released during a live minting event at Bright Moments Gallery, Venice Beach in collaboration with Bright Moments, fx(hash) and Tender.\n",

During this time, I have released more than 160 separate collections. I am also extremely grateful to all collectors, authors, designers and artists whom I met during this time. You are wonderful people. Once again I want to express my gratitude to everyone who minted my work and help financially in such a difficult time. Each coin is very important and has played a critical role in my life.\n\nThis collection has a final cost of 0 XTZ. If suddenly you like the minted work and you want to express your gratitude, you can write to me on Twitter, retweet or mint any other work from my profile. Only at your request.\n\nMade with p5.js ",
