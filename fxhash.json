At the coast it is easy to forget everything and be in the moment. The view is expansive and no matter how ominous the clouds, somewhere the sun breaks through. \n\nAt the same time, the raging sea can be life-threatening. Many have lost their lives at sea or by the sea, some by flooding, some in the battle for peace, others in search of a better life. \n\nThe sea, with its many faces and stories, is beautiful, terrifying and everything in between. \n\n#Features\nAre there birds, and if so, how many?\nIs it raining?\nHow cloudy is it?\nHow rough is the sea?\n\nGenerative art coded with p5js.\n\n",

            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "\"Garden, Monoliths\" is the result of an algorithm that started in April 2021. It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

The buildings, wrought in shades of dreamy pastels, appear as though they have been plucked from some other time and place, and set adrift in a new and unknowable realm.\n\nHere, amidst the stillness and silence, ropes hang loosely like vines, connecting the structures in a delicate web of possibility. The architecture of the buildings is vaguely familiar, yet strangely surreal, hinting at a past now forgotten.\n\nAs the eye wanders through this landscape of suspended structures, a feeling of nostalgia begins to seep in. There is a sense that these cities were once inhabited, bustling with the energy of human life. Now, they stand alone, abandoned and forgotten, as nature slowly reclaims its territory.\n\n\n\nThe AERO series explores how a minimalistic set of shapes and rules can be extrapolated to create complex assemblies, the same way individual buildings will form villages and cities.\n\nTo add a sense of organic texture to these geometric structures, ropes that connect certain squares have been added. They can sometimes take on the appearance of vines. This addition aims creates a sense of tension between the man-made and the natural.\n\n\n\nDouble click or double tap to save the current image\n\nIn fullscreen mode / live view:\nAdd \"&size=xxxx\" at the end of the url to generate a custom sized image\nAdd \"&clean\" at the end of the url to remove the grain effect\n\n\nArtist: Estienne\nFeb. 2023\nLicense: NFT 2.0",

            "description": "Pulling Strings was largly inspired by the seemingly random outputs created with the \"pull-string\" technique, a technique where strings are being used to draw on a paper or canvas.\nDepending on what kind of string or color is being used, the results can vary a lot.\n\nThe initial goal was to replicate the technique digitally but I quickly realized that I would need to simulate way too many aspects to get e satisfying result in an acceptable render-time.\n\nI therefore tried to embrace the digital environment and let the user easily swap out palettes and backgrounds to try different combinations.\n\nThe custom-built \"pigments-system\" tries to approximate color-distribution of the real world.\n\nPress 'S' to save the current still.\nPress 'P' to Play/Pause the animation.\nPress 'R' to reset the canvas and restart the rendering.\nPress 'V' to toggle the vignette effect.\nPress 'F' to fast-forward the rendering (if possible).\nPress 'N' to create a new artwork, just for fun, nowhere saved.\nPress 'Space' to toggle responsive-mode.\n\nIt's possible to use the alphanumeric keys to set a high-res resolution (1-9), the higher the number, the higher the resolution, default is 2.\n\n- @TeNinEightNFTs\n\nCreated with p5.js\n\n-------------\nSpecial thanks to @MarnixKeller and @neuromantic6 for discovering a bug in the previous release!\nAnother thank you goes to @squiddy_q for helping to verify a bugfix on test-net!",

            "description": "Created by Eko33, a generative artist featured at the Tezos Ecosystem Exhibition (Art Basel Miami 2021).\n\nThis generative artwork creates a limited series of distinctive artworks based on unique hash seeds.\n\nThe algorithmic approach of this collection generates a broad spectrum of unique outcomes, inspired by the \"giant machine\" from the movie \"Modern Times.\"\n\nBeyond a classic mechanical representation, Eko33 aims to convey multiple emotions while embracing the cold nature of algorithms.\n\nComputer-generated generative art can be seen as a gigantic assembly line. Still, its true nature gives the artist complete freedom from all commercially available tools/constraints.\n\nThe collection \"Modern Times\" highlights the dark ages of generative arts using a bichromatic color palette and evolves toward the contemporary \"Digital Renaissance\" era using warmer, more acid and \"pop\" colors.\n\nAbout Eko33:\nOfficial fx(hash) page: https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Eko33\nOfficial Website: https://www.eko33.com/\n",

            "description": "Bardez is the Armenian word for garden. It is etymologically tied to an ancient word for paradise, but that link goes deeper than etymology. Gardens have always been small pieces of paradise for me, and hearing the word in Armenian triggers a flood of warm memories.\n\nMemories of wandering around my grandfather’s garden, plucking ripe plums and figs from their branches.\nMemories of playing in my parents yard, the scent of jasmine in the summer heat.\nOf sun warmed tomatoes in my mom’s vegetable patch.\nThe smell of dirt and grass.\nMud on my hands.\nSun on my skin.\nMemories of paradise.\n\nI hope you enjoy these gardens I’ve planted, and I hope they remind you of some warm and wonderful memories.\n \nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n - This piece uses a shader to compute the lighting of the terrain in the first frame. If you don’t have a graphics card, you may have difficulty running this.\n\n - Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you the progress of the render, and also show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.\n\n - Finally, collectors at the highest tier will be entitled to a signed print of their edition. For further details and updates, keep an eye on my Twitter (@_NatSarkissian).\n",
