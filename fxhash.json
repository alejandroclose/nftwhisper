We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "'drawz' fxh_t019 is also vanilla javascript template for fxhash\n\n\nfeel free, to use (parts of) it, and learn from the source.\nand use it as a start for your own creative projects and adventures\n\nThis version has some extra routines you can use; \nand a lot of comments in the source\n\n\nA cleaned up - smaller version; just doing the basic tech screen & window-handeling etc. with just drawing dots can be found here.\n(and older and newer updated versions)\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\n\nMostly I start with a clean template; \nthen add: copy-paste routines into it. Things I want to use; sprites, text-font, filters, lines, 3D etc. \nLike kinda lego blocks. Some routines I re-use for 30 years now. \nAlthough often they have changed over time.\n\n\nVanilla javascript - And directly control your rgb buffer\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\ncons:\n- can be overwhelming for starting coders compared to p5js\n- you have to write / use and tinker with new drawing routines by yourself. \n- still can be optimized a lot, and run much faster\n-- (feel free to do that! - release new versions yourself)\n- I just coded it in Notepad++ and tested it in a browser.\n- I have no experience with git-hub, or those other nifty tools\n- I'm more an Artist than a coder, still learning new things as well.\n- I have my own 'old' coding style I picked up ages ago, and still use now and then. Started with basic and Z80a as a teenager.\n- for sure there are still some stupid bugs, spelling errors in it  ^___^\n\npros:\n- fxtemplate - fxpreview when done drawing / splash-screen support on top; while drawing.\n- do like 4000 x 4000 images on safari; on an old Iphone 5\n- just 1 index.html now - small file size: \n- the source of the 'cleaned-up' version is now 34b (not minified, and still comments in the source; can be even smaller)\n- direct control of the RGB buffer; every pixel.\n- I added some basic routines, like drawing points, lines, squares, sprite-brushes, filters, and my pixel-font\n- draw, add-mix or subtract - manipulate every pixel how you wish\n- I work with a big off-screen kind of image; a rgb-buffer; so drawing goes 'mucho' faster and render it to a screen-scaled image.\n- no other libraries used\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nMouse-click switches between:\n- screen scaled image\n- The large image \n\n- The work will refresh and restart after some time\n\nSave image - with s-key \n(includes the fxhash key-seed and num# of the follow-up images)\n--- It can take some seconds before the saving happens; \n--- the browser has to handle (very) large MB .png files first \n--- before it can save them \n\n- splash image support - to hide drawing at start\n- redraw the image after a while; or not.\n- mouse position check for the bigger image\n- fps counter for testing etc.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nwritten in vanilla JavaScript, more info in the source-code\n\n\ndrawz - latest or an updated version can be found at.\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\nIt would be nice; to include more routines into it\nin the future.\n\nAnd instead of 1 big library with everything in it\nI would like to have these templates; \nwhere you can add different little snippets and routines \nthat you want to use into it, and start playing next.\nStill learning new things as well. And getting inspired.\n\nI don't mind people to use the tech-source as a start for their own projects. \n\nBut the palette, and composition & structure build-up; is mine. \nDon't change just 1 or 2 -things then re-release it.\n\nIf you want to release something of your own,\nyour sketch and generative work; really should look total different!\nYou can use the technics to draw new things,\nbut you have to start from scratch again; \nchoosing points, lines etc. to play with and go from there.\nEnjoy! \n\n\n-for the love of Art and jumping in rain puddles-\n\n'like jimi and guitar'  0__.  ^____^\n\n\nxxx  amsterdam  chillout\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n",

            "description": "Pastellhood is a generative artwork made up of pastel hues, triangles, circles and rectangles in a grid with a smooth shadow giving the observer the feeling of depth. The pastel hues give the artwork a soft and calming feeling, while the geometric shapes add an element of interest and intrigue. The grid-like structure of the artwork helps to create a sense of balance and order.\n\nWhen looking at this piece, the observer can feel a sense of calm and serenity while these soft colors and shapes help to create a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere.\n\nCuriosity: Pastel colors have been shown to have a calming effect on people. They are often used in hospitals and waiting rooms because they create a sense of serenity. The soft colors are soothing and can help to lower blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nThe simplicity is always an option in my personal projects because it can allow the viewer to focus on the main elements of the piece and appreciate them more. Additionally, it can make the artwork more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nHope you enjoy!\nSimple is beautiful!\n\n(Press 'S' to save)\n\nD. & Tiyen\n__________________________________\nSeptember 2022.",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

Some routines I re-use for 30 years now. \nAlthough often they have changed over time.\n\n\nVanilla javascript - And directly control your rgb buffer\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\ncons:\n- can be overwhelming for starting coders compared to p5js\n- you have to write / use and tinker with new drawing routines by yourself. \n- still can be optimized a lot, and run much faster\n-- (feel free to do that! - release new versions yourself)\n- I just coded it in Notepad++ and tested it in a browser.\n- I have no experience with git-hub, or those other nifty tools\n- I'm more an Artist than a coder, still learning new things as well.\n- I have my own 'old' coding style I picked up ages ago, and still use now and then. Started with basic and Z80a as a teenager.\n- for sure there are still some stupid bugs, spelling errors in it  ^___^\n\npros:\n- fxtemplate - fxpreview when done drawing / splash-screen support on top; while drawing.\n- do like 4000 x 4000 images on safari; on an old Iphone 5\n- just 1 index.html now - small file size: \n- the source of the 'cleaned-up' version is now 34b (not minified, and still comments in the source; can be even smaller)\n- direct control of the RGB buffer; every pixel.\n- I added some basic routines, like drawing points, lines, squares, sprite-brushes, filters, and my pixel-font\n- draw, add-mix or subtract - manipulate every pixel how you wish\n- I work with a big off-screen kind of image; a rgb-buffer; so drawing goes 'mucho' faster and render it to a screen-scaled image.\n- no other libraries used\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nMouse-click switches between:\n- screen scaled image\n- The large image \n\n- The work will refresh and restart after some time\n\nSave image - with s-key \n(includes the fxhash key-seed and num# of the follow-up images)\n--- It can take some seconds before the saving happens; \n--- the browser has to handle (very) large MB .png files first \n--- before it can save them \n\n- splash image support - to hide drawing at start\n- redraw the image after a while; or not.\n- mouse position check for the bigger image\n- fps counter for testing etc.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nwritten in vanilla JavaScript, more info in the source-code\n\n\ndrawz - latest or an updated version can be found at.\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\nIt would be nice; to include more routines into it\nin the future.\n\nAnd instead of 1 big library with everything in it\nI would like to have these templates; \nwhere you can add different little snippets and routines \nthat you want to use into it, and start playing next.\nStill learning new things as well. And getting inspired.\n\nI don't mind people to use the tech-source as a start for their own projects. \n\nBut the palette, and composition & structure build-up; is mine. \nDon't change just 1 or 2 -things then re-release it.\n\nIf you want to release something of your own,\nyour sketch and generative work; really should look total different!\nYou can use the technics to draw new things,\nbut you have to start from scratch again; \nchoosing points, lines etc. to play with and go from there.\nEnjoy! \n\n\n-for the love of Art and jumping in rain puddles-\n\n'like jimi and guitar'  0__.  ^____^\n\n\nxxx  amsterdam  chillout\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",
