            "description": "This series unearths the unique and energetic rhythms found within simple repetitions. Using distinct minimalist components, the algorithm patterns, contorts, and intertwines geometries to reveal rich and vital maximalist compositions. The explorations of Risonanza revels in the quirks that emerge through this process, seemingly with spontaneity. They invite us to identify and savor the underlying simplicity of a common language that resides amidst all manners of imperfections, randomness, and intricate complexities we perceive around us.\n\nEmbodying the equilibrium between simplicity and intricacy, these works represent the dance between the innate harmony of existence and life's unknown paths. This balance of forces provides a simple and joyful invitation to attune to the energetic, complex, and singular harmonious essence of each work of art – an embodiment of the eternal resonance that courses through the universe.\n\n\n—————\n\nTENDER x whitekross\nSeptember 2023\n\nRisonanza is Italian for Resonance, and is a generative art series created by Alessandro Fiore (AKA whitekross) in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n—————\n\n\nKey commands:\n\n1 = 2000x3000\n2 = 4000x6000\n3 = 6000x9000 (Dependent on your browser limitations, tested on Safari (Mac))\ns = Save at current resolution\n\n\nLicense:\n\nSee LICENSE.md in live view for details.",

The sun is present enough to light the sky, but still remains below the horizon leaving the land slightly underexposed and the trees nearly silhouetted ...\n\n---\n\nMy journey continues to make the most compelling landscapes I can spring from a text editor. I spent a lot of time examining painted as well as traditional digital art landscapes, both of which are incredibly mature mediums. Paint, in particular, seems to be completely mastered - with some artist's work leaving nothing to be desired. What I have seen in digital has also blown me away. I want to work towards the bar set by these artists and marry their aesthetic prowess with the power, variety, and excitement of generative art.\n\n--\n\n// Technical Notes\n-The render will take ~2-3 minutes.\n\n-Default resolution is 3000x6000 px (including letterbox). While it's possible to render at any resolution, this is my intended resolution for the project - the product of an artistic choice to make the piece behave more like a photograph. This limited (but still high) resolution gives the features at the smallest scales some fuzziness, giving a sense that detail extends below the resolution of the piece. I think this imparts a more natural aesthetic as opposed to the perfect forms and edges of canvas shapes.\n\n\n// Controls\nPress \"z\" to zoom in, and take a look around. Keys \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", and \"4\" to control the zoom amount.\n\nPress \"s\" to download the image. Right-click-save will not work.\n\n\n// Owners\nToken owners will have access to artist prints. Send me a DM on twitter.\n",

            "description": "In march of this year, I started working on a new series involving multi-layering, and overriding shapes. Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

            "description": "Power Ranges is an artistic endeavor born not from a concept, but from the pure spirit of experimentation. While I could attempt to uncover a profound narrative or significance behind this project, the truth of the matter is that Power Ranges is, in essence, just a form of digital doodling with code. A testament to the beauty of unbridled exploration in the realm of art, where discovery and wonder sometimes take precedence over any predetermined purpose.\n\nIn this project, I have harnessed the power of height maps and ranges to create an intriguing visual experience. The origin was the implementation of the marching squares algorithm that I had never used before. From there I started to play with height maps, mixing noise and custom shapes. Finally, I wrote a parser for the map in order to generate the isolines that are then drawn using my beloved Superline script.\n\nI hope you’ll like the outputs as much as I did while testing the algorithm. Some of them can be truly cute.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ”s” to save the current output.\n\nPressing the keys “1”, “2” or “3” the artwork will regenerate at a different scale.\n\nThe “size” parameter can also be passed via URL with the values “s”, “m” or “l” to initialize the generator with the desired size.\n\n=======================================\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\nPowered by p5 and chroma.\n",

Sliders?\n\n\n“Pensado a mano” explores the intersection of Generative Art and Hand Drawing. The collector, by drawing a predefined number of shapes on canvas, creates a unique hand-crafted seed that generates the final artwork. That is the only customisable param, thought by hand, which interacts with various random attributes to produce a unique composition.\n\n“…the time we spend doing and making things, the process…”\n\nAnd yet the process continues. On the background, the code generates a plottable svg.\nAn artificially extended process, from hand to screen, from screen to paper, that creates a new kind of mixed media.\n\nSigned plots will soon be claimable via Artfora (tbd price + shipping)\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\n1 - Draw the requested shapes and wait to see the result. You can change the Seed Nr. slider if you don't like the selected mode.\n2 - Press “C” to copy drawing to Clipboard\n3 - Copy the clipboard contents to the text-input on the fx(params) sidebar\n\n***Important. If you buy several tickets, make sure you don't mint the same Seed Nr. twice (slider)\n\npress “S” to save the PNG, press “P” to plot the SVG\n\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nThis is a high-supply token minted during a bear market.
