            "description": "Leviathan is a generative collection of large bodies made form particles, materialised from the viewers own subconscious. Atoms form gargantuan objects - subatomic monoliths and microscopic giants. Playing with the sense of scale it draws on the viewer’s subjective way of associating forms, a pattern that becomes a mirror, a skeleton for them to project. \n\nPart artist, part viewer. Leviathan asks us to question these relationships of creation, ownership and meaning. It is a chemical reaction that the artist starts and you finish. A colossal dream we are all sharing together - a leviathan.\n\n\nControls:\ns or double tap: Download image\n1 : Download 2400 x 4000\n2 : Download 3600 x 6000\n3 : Download 4800 x 8000\n4 : Download 7200 x 12000",

            "description": "In this 100% code generated bloom project, I made many new attempts to combine photography elements into generative art.\n\nFirst at all, I love the images of early wet plate collodion photography (published in 1851 by Frederick Scott Archer), so I tried to make these artworks look similar.\n\nTo have the image more photography aesthetic, depth of field is an important factor. I put lots of effort into making it fully present in these images.\n\nFurthermore, I think these days few have an experience of darkroom processes, therefore I also tried to make an algorithm of animations to simulation the developing process that darkroom workers are obsessed with.\n\nAnd finally, the most important thing, why I chose rose as the protagonist? The answer is pretty simple, because I want to present these artworks of 99 roses to my dear wife.\n\nMade with p5.js/WebGL.\n\nNote: the frame of the image might be different for different GPU system.\n",

Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "This experimental project involves an on-chain cellular automaton. The features and cellular automaton rules are derived from the minter's address. Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "The Corium is a roughly spherical mass (diameter ~1km), of currently unknown origins situated within the core region of the solar system's asteroid belt.\nThe body was discovered during a uranium extraction mission undertaken by ET Resources at the behest of Station 733-H (Mars colony) leadership, when ionising radiation levels detected by deployed surface craft exceeded equipment and personnel tolerance levels by many orders of magnitude.\n\nWhile ETR crew were quick to respond to local abort orders (27 minutes from initial readings to fleet reorientation); Station 733-H made the determination that radiation exposure levels were already far in excess of anything that could be reasonably mitigated upon the ETR fleet's return.\nThe ETR fleet was ordered to jettison fuel reserves under Section 9 of the Space Corporations Act (Mars) approximately 90 minutes after the readings were initially reported. It is understood that all deployed personnel accessed their barbiturate rations within the following 24 hours.\n\nThe fleet itself remains in position some ~3000kms from The Corium, with plans to relocate the vessels still underway (albeit a low priority).\n\n\nSTATION 733-H OBSERVATION REPORT SUMMARY (14.1.1)\n\nTo date, remote analysis suggests that the body is compositionally similar to corium deposits observed following terrestrial nuclear disasters, consisting of a range of solidified radioactive compounds as well as a number of currently unidentified metal alloys. More in-depth analysis has been impossible to date due to the rapid physical decay of personnel and equipment as their proximity to samples reach a critical threshold.\n\nAll samples have so far been extruded from the surface of The Corium via laser, and maneuvered into orbit around Mars at the edge of it's sphere of influence (at a distance of no less than 50,000kms from Station 733-H), via projectile barrage and gas envelopment.\n\nThe surface of The Corium itself is littered with an array of clearly engineered forms; radial and rectangular patterns, deep crevasses, mazes and grids with only a select few areas resembling the pools of lava observed where Corium has formed terrestrially (it is unclear whether these deposits have formed since the surface was initially engineered).\n\nThe accompanying files are LIDAR renders of the extracted samples in proximity to Station 733-H and are marked for dissemination to terrestrial research teams on Mars. Study of The Corium remains the sole priority of Station 733-H research personnel, as any risks presented to the solar system or its inhabitants are currently not well understood.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe piece will render from the top right and might take ~5-10 seconds to begin.\n\nAppend \"&print=true\" to the live render URL for a hi-res output.",

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "　During the winter months, when I do not see any flowers in the city, it is as if I have forgotten that flowers exist. Sometimes, some time after the flowers have disappeared from the world, I suddenly spot a red bud on a branch poking out from the eaves of a house. It is a time when I have become accustomed to winter and have grown too accustomed to it. I am red! I think. Red! That is the ”ume\" blossom. Many people think of cherry blossoms when they think of spring flowers, but my favorite spring flower is the ume blossom. It is a wonderful flower that reminds me that there are flowers in the world and that spring is coming.\n　Ume blossoms are forgotten by the time the cherry blossoms bloom. I was born into this world on April 5, right on the border of when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom or not. I am born every year with the news that the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. But the plum blossoms are history. They are history and predecessors who built the world before I was born. When I am born again toward spring, I want to cherish the past. With this in mind, I created this work, wondering if I could paint the ume blossoms.\n　When I was making this, I felt like I was making sweets. It was a new sensation for me. The sensation of taking something that is commonplace in everyday life and cooking it in my own way was exactly like making sweets. I don't think sweets are noble. But I think they are something a little special. Above all, when sweets are placed in front of you, they bring forth a calm joy that cannot be contained from the bottom of one's heart. If there were many colors of such joy, if there were various kinds of sweets, I am sure we would be happy. This is a ume sweet. Please try it. I believe that these will become our cells and our past.\n\nume = 梅\n　This time, I put words to the color palette and shapes. It is not a universal language, but it is a special sound for me. If you want to know the meaning of the words, please ask me on twitter : @shirasu_nejio. However, I don't think that meaning is necessarily essential.",

            "description": "This generative projects employs a vector field created by composing various functions based on a \"genome\".\n\nAlthough I tried to expose only those parameters that collectors care about, there are a few things to keep in mind while playing with them: The \"Manual genome\" parameter is only considered when \"Random genome\" boolean is `false`. Also the genome can be composed only of lowercase and uppercase alphabetical letters.\n\nAn easy trick to find a genome on your liking is to first check the \"Random genome\" control while you use the randomize parameters. Once you found one, you can copy from features and paste it on \"Manual genome\" field and uncheck the random.\n\nFor the sake of feedback I included a small text bases progress indicator on the upper left corner. Also in the same corner I included a link that will start rendering higher version.\n\nThe resolution of the rendering is 1024 x 1024 / aspect ratio. The higher version is 4096 x 4096 / aspect ratio.\n\nThe 50% of royalties go to the minter.\n\nPress 's' key to save a png.\nClick on canvas to watch the rendering at 100% zoom factor.\nClick it again to return to the scaled to fit the window.",
