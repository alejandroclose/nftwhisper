However upon examination discernible patterns begin to emerge revealing a semblance of order amidst the commotion. This is the essence of art; the harmony that arises within the boundaries of programmed randomness.\n\nThe vibrant colors, seemingly chosen at whim seamlessly blend together akin, to the dance of the aurora borealis, across a canvas. Lines and textures intertwine, creating a landscape of a planets surface; every crevice and peak stands as evidence of the algorithms careful contemplation.\n\nThis artwork softly whispers about the realms concealed within our machines. It speaks to the flow of data and energy that courses through our lives circuits—often unnoticed—yet here it takes on tangible form and captivating shades. The image encourages us to ponder upon the realm of digitization—a realm crafted from code yet resonating with an intriguing kind of vitality.",

What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "BRIDGE is a collaborative project for fx(hash), conceived by Camille Roux. The project was announced on Twitter on Feb. 7, 2022 [1]. Artists were given two weeks to contribute code that would draw tiles representing a bridge, in their own style. Artists were free to implement their own artistic vision, subject to one simple constraint: Respect the coordinates of the tiles for each iteration of the art. \n\nEach iteration has a default style determined randomly at mint. This style is named in the features and displayed in the thumbnail. However, each iteration includes all styles, and you can cycle through them by clicking on or touching the image. Styles will be shown in the order in which they are listed under INCLUDED STYLES.\n\nPress \"s\" to save a screenshot.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nI'm Camille Roux. I planned to do a lot of collab this year with fx(hash) artists I like, but it takes too much time, or maybe I like too many artists :) Some days ago, I woke up with this idea in mind: \"Hey! What if I make a collaboration with all the artists I like at once!\" This is how the BRIDGE project was born.\n\nMoreover, I love the mutual aid and solidarity between fx(hash) generative artists. The BRIDGE can be seen as a symbol of the link between us ♥️.\n\nThe project has also served as an inspiration for participants to extend and develop their coding skills outside their usual areas of interest. The code for the entire project remains available on GitHub [2].\n\nTHE INCLUDED STYLES\n\nText-to-Bridge (TTB) by Ada Ada Ada\nhttps://twitter.com/ada_ada_ada_art\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ada%20Ada%20Ada\n\nBlest Path by Anaglyphic\nhttps://twitter.com/anaglyph_ic\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/anaglyphic\n\nThe Old Woody Dock by Aqw_Zert\nhttps://twitter.com/Aqw_Zert\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Aqw_Zert\n\nBridge-Tunnel by Laurent Houdard\nhttps://twitter.com/CablesAndPixels\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Laurent%20Houdard\n\nEvaporating by Camille Roux\nhttps://twitter.com/camillerouxart\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Camille%20Roux\n\nBuildings by Camille Roux\nhttps://twitter.com/camillerouxart\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Camille%20Roux\n\nTGH Bridge by David Esq\nhttps://twitter.com/emcyze\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/David%20Esq\n\nCitadel by devnull\nhttps://twitter.com/lostpunks\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/devnull\n\nEinstein–Rosen by Elsif\nhttps://twitter.com/ElsifThen\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/elsif\n\nPath through the city by Estienne\nhttps://twitter.com/Estienne_ca\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Estienne\n\nstarry night//glitchy night by frederative\nhttps://twitter.com/frederative\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/frederative\n\nBlackboard by Generative Pen\nhttps://twitter.com/GenerativePen\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Generative%20Pen\n\nMozaik by Gorik\nhttps://twitter.com/gorikfr\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Gorik\n\nDevour by grosgg\nhttps://twitter.com/rosgg\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/grosgg\n\nburning bridges by jeres\nhttps://twitter.com/heyjeres\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/jeres\n\nSpace Disco Dancefloor by Julien Labat\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienLabat\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/julabat\n\n/nt/r/t///a/ by lunarean\nhttps://twitter.com/lunarean\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/lunarean\n\nNara by Makio64\nhttps://twitter.com/makio64\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Makio64\n\nBifrost by mandyBrigwell\nhttps://twitter.com/mandybrigwell\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/mandybrigwell\n\nRain under the stars by Matt Circles\nhttps://twitter.com/matt_circles\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Matt%20Circles\n\nEsoteric Oasis by Nick Dima\nhttps://twitter.com/nickdima\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Nick%20Dima\n\nStreet Lights by phil_osophie\nhttps://twitter.com/phil_osophie\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/phil_osophie\n\nRise by Robin Metcalfe\nhttps://twitter.com/solarise_webdev\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Robin\n\nFlower Bridge by RVig\nhttps://twitter.com/rvig_art\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/rvig\n\nhere comes the sun by shuhblam\nhttps://twitter.com/shuhblam\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/shuhblam\n\nInto another world by Claus O.

            "description": "BRIDGE is a collaborative project for fx(hash), conceived by Camille Roux. The project was announced on Twitter on Feb. 7, 2022 [1]. Artists were given two weeks to contribute code that would draw tiles representing a bridge, in their own style. Artists were free to implement their own artistic vision, subject to one simple constraint: Respect the coordinates of the tiles for each iteration of the art. \n\nEach iteration has a default style determined randomly at mint. This style is named in the features and displayed in the thumbnail. However, each iteration includes all styles, and you can cycle through them by clicking on or touching the image. Styles will be shown in the order in which they are listed under INCLUDED STYLES.\n\nPress \"s\" to save a screenshot.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nI'm Camille Roux. I planned to do a lot of collab this year with fx(hash) artists I like, but it takes too much time, or maybe I like too many artists :) Some days ago, I woke up with this idea in mind: \"Hey! What if I make a collaboration with all the artists I like at once!\" This is how the BRIDGE project was born.\n\nMoreover, I love the mutual aid and solidarity between fx(hash) generative artists. The BRIDGE can be seen as a symbol of the link between us ♥️.\n\nThe project has also served as an inspiration for participants to extend and develop their coding skills outside their usual areas of interest. The code for the entire project remains available on GitHub [2].\n\nTHE INCLUDED STYLES\n\nText-to-Bridge (TTB) by Ada Ada Ada\nhttps://twitter.com/ada_ada_ada_art\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ada%20Ada%20Ada\n\nBlest Path by Anaglyphic\nhttps://twitter.com/anaglyph_ic\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/anaglyphic\n\nThe Old Woody Dock by Aqw_Zert\nhttps://twitter.com/Aqw_Zert\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Aqw_Zert\n\nBridge-Tunnel by Laurent Houdard\nhttps://twitter.com/CablesAndPixels\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Laurent%20Houdard\n\nEvaporating by Camille Roux\nhttps://twitter.com/camillerouxart\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Camille%20Roux\n\nBuildings by Camille Roux\nhttps://twitter.com/camillerouxart\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Camille%20Roux\n\nTGH Bridge by David Esq\nhttps://twitter.com/emcyze\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/David%20Esq\n\nCitadel by devnull\nhttps://twitter.com/lostpunks\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/devnull\n\nEinstein–Rosen by Elsif\nhttps://twitter.com/ElsifThen\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/elsif\n\nPath through the city by Estienne\nhttps://twitter.com/Estienne_ca\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Estienne\n\nstarry night//glitchy night by frederative\nhttps://twitter.com/frederative\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/frederative\n\nBlackboard by Generative Pen\nhttps://twitter.com/GenerativePen\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Generative%20Pen\n\nMozaik by Gorik\nhttps://twitter.com/gorikfr\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Gorik\n\nDevour by grosgg\nhttps://twitter.com/rosgg\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/grosgg\n\nburning bridges by jeres\nhttps://twitter.com/heyjeres\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/jeres\n\nSpace Disco Dancefloor by Julien Labat\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienLabat\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/julabat\n\n/nt/r/t///a/ by lunarean\nhttps://twitter.com/lunarean\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/lunarean\n\nNara by Makio64\nhttps://twitter.com/makio64\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Makio64\n\nBifrost by mandyBrigwell\nhttps://twitter.com/mandybrigwell\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/mandybrigwell\n\nRain under the stars by Matt Circles\nhttps://twitter.com/matt_circles\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Matt%20Circles\n\nEsoteric Oasis by Nick Dima\nhttps://twitter.com/nickdima\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Nick%20Dima\n\nStreet Lights by phil_osophie\nhttps://twitter.com/phil_osophie\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/phil_osophie\n\nRise by Robin Metcalfe\nhttps://twitter.com/solarise_webdev\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Robin\n\nFlower Bridge by RVig\nhttps://twitter.com/rvig_art\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/rvig\n\nhere comes the sun by shuhblam\nhttps://twitter.com/shuhblam\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/shuhblam\n\nInto another world by Claus O.
