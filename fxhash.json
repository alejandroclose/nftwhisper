            "description": "A 4444 character magic spell for my rayhatching framework to render thinking rocks.\n\nThis piece may take some time to render (about 1-3 minutes, depending on hardware). The rendering time is symbolic of the vastness and agelessness of these rock structures, it is recommended to use the rendering time to contemplate deeply the concept of time spans so incredibly long, that to experience them they would have to overwrite your memories several times and thus are impossible to truly comprehend.\n\nTo ponder how, if they are so old, how come some of them float? Are these rocks the fixtures and has time and space itself eroded around them?\n\nThis project uses an approach called \"rejection sampling\". This means the program generates a random set of parameters, and then checks/previews how the resulting image would look. It measures the amount of visible objects, light and shadows, and then determines whether these fall into acceptable ranges. If not, it generates a new set of parameters. For certain hashes over a 100 parameter sets may be checked before it accepts the image.\n\nThe features of this project are \"cliff\", \"ground\", \"thing\" and \"sky\". These are not parameters, they are actual measurements of the resulting image, indicating what percentage of the view is occupied.\n\nThis piece can be saved as an SVG and plotted. It is recommended to run a path order optimization tool such as vpype or axicli, this will greatly reduce plotting time.\n\nSome options can be changed via the URL:\n\n&w=.25 : The line width in millimetres.\n&d=.4 : Line density (multiplier to linewidth).\n&h=235 : Page height in millimetres. The aspect ratio is 16:9, for a width of 420mm, suitable for A3 plotting.\n\nThe line width is set to 0.25 millimetres to suit most common fine liner pen stroke widths when plotting. \n\nIf you don't intend to plot this piece, perhaps also try rendering it at 0.2 or even 0.1 millimetres line width, for an even more detailed image (it will also take longer to render).\n\n(c) 2022 by Piter Pasma",

Erosion and oxidation recombined in plumbing, slowly causing the pipes to evolve sentience and grow to the horizon in a blooming chaos of rust, steel and concrete.\n\nIndustrial Devolution is the first long-form generative project using my rayhatching algorithm. It combines a raymarcher for SDFs with a surface orientation based flow field renderer in order to draw arbitrary 3D scenes as line art, with an organic, hatched drawing style. The SDF formulas were generatively designed and parametrized to form ancient landscapes of corroded industrial pipes and immense, ageless blocks of concrete.\n\nThe entire code of Industrial Devolution is 3930 characters, using no external libraries.\n\nWhen done rendering, the output can be right-click saved as an SVG file and plotted using a plotter such as an Axidraw. The lines in the SVG are in random order, so it is recommended to use a path reordering/optimizing tool such as axicli or vpype before plotting. This will greatly reduce the plotting time. The output SVG is intended to be plotted at A3 (297x420mm) using a 0.4mm black pen (but feel free to experiment). You can change this by adding these options to the URL:\n\n  &lw=.4 the linewidth in millimetres\n  &d=.8 the line density (multiplier to the line width, density 0.6 recommended for plotter output)\n  &h=420 how high the page is, in millimetres (width is always height * 0.707)\n  &bg=1 set to 0 to remove background rectangle (bg=0 recommended for plotter output)\n\nIndustrial Devolution was released during a live minting event at Bright Moments Gallery, Venice Beach in collaboration with Bright Moments, fx(hash) and Tender.\n",

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1.

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5.

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

Created using pure JavaScript, without any dependencies.\n\nMoreover, the fact that this piece was created through a collaboration with artificial intelligence adds an extra layer of cyberpunk flair to the work.",
