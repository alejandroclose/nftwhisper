            "description": "\"Junina\" is a tribute to the June popular festivities in Brazil, when the streets and house facades are decorated on many cities, mainly on the Northeast Region of the country. Small flags, paper balloons, and lamps are hung on public space creating a very special atmosphere and colorful landscapes. \n\nPlenty of forró (traditional music), bonfires, fireworks, typical food and drinks are part of these festivities that celebrate rural popular culture. The “Festas Juninas” (June festivities) have an important affective place in the imaginary of the Brazilian population. \n\n\"Junina\" continues the experimentations with code of my previous work \"Monotipia\". The challenge of creating graphic compositions with simple elements remains. Searching and trying to delve deeper into ways to play with the rhythm and subtleties of transparencies, colors, shapes and textures.\n\nThis project is also an homage to the painters who made the Brazilian June festivities as the theme of their works, especially Alfredo Volpi (1896-1988) and Alberto da Veiga Guignard (1896-1962), but also Anita Malfatti (1889-1964), Emiliano Di Cavalcanti (1897-1976), Heitor dos Prazeres (1898-1966), and many others.\n\n---\nFeatures:\n-> 8 palettes (rarest = grayscale)\n-> 9 compositions\n-> Elements: 6 geometric shapes OR mixed element compositions\n-> 5 canvas formats: \n-----> tall portrait (9:16)\n-----> portrait (2:3)\n-----> square (1:1)\n-----> landscape (3:2)\n-----> wide landscape (16:9) = rarest\n-> Border colors: \n-----> soft\n-----> dark\n-----> deep gray\n-----> soberest color from palette\n-----> random color from palette (rarest)\n\n* The names of the color palettes are words related to popular June festivals. The decision to use untranslated expressions was made because these words carry many poetic meanings in Portuguese. For example, \"cinza\" means \"gray\" but also \"ash\". A word that refers to both the color and to the residue that results from burning wood in bonfires.\n\n---\nTo save the image as a png file, type:\n[1] save at actual size \n[2] save with 2000px height\n[3] save with 3000px height\n[4] save with 4000px height\n[5] save with 5000px height\n\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n---\nCreated with p5.js\n\n---\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2023\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens —created in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco— that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking “what if” questions such as “What if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?” Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road —one direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature— it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario’s thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",

            "description": "平衡 (heikō): Equilibrium\n\nAs someone with ADHD, focusing has always been a challenge for me. It's difficult for me to concentrate, especially when it comes to learning new things like p5.js. Despite the difficulty, I pushed through and managed to grasp the concepts, which was a significant accomplishment for me. To commemorate this personal milestone, I chose to incorporate the theme of focus into my first generative art token.\n\nDrawing inspiration from my childhood hobbies, I decided to represent the concept of focus by stacking stones on top of each other. As a child, I found joy in this activity, and it served as a metaphor for the determination and concentration required to overcome challenges.\n\nIn addition to my personal connection, I also drew inspiration from the Japanese culture of zen, concentration, and focus. The overall theme of my generative art token reflects these principles, paying homage to the mindset of finding inner peace and clarity through focus and concentration.\n\nBy combining my personal journey with the symbolism of stacked stones and the Japanese culture of zen, I hope to convey the importance of focus and celebrate the achievement of overcoming obstacles, especially for individuals like myself who face unique challenges in maintaining concentration.\n\nPlease press ‘2’ to ‘7’ to change the resolution (max 5600 × 7000 px).\nUse the key ’S’ to save the output as a PNG file.

The rendering time is symbolic of the vastness and agelessness of these rock structures, it is recommended to use the rendering time to contemplate deeply the concept of time spans so incredibly long, that to experience them they would have to overwrite your memories several times and thus are impossible to truly comprehend.\n\nTo ponder how, if they are so old, how come some of them float? Are these rocks the fixtures and has time and space itself eroded around them?\n\nThis project uses an approach called \"rejection sampling\". This means the program generates a random set of parameters, and then checks/previews how the resulting image would look. It measures the amount of visible objects, light and shadows, and then determines whether these fall into acceptable ranges. If not, it generates a new set of parameters. For certain hashes over a 100 parameter sets may be checked before it accepts the image.\n\nThe features of this project are \"cliff\", \"ground\", \"thing\" and \"sky\". These are not parameters, they are actual measurements of the resulting image, indicating what percentage of the view is occupied.\n\nThis piece can be saved as an SVG and plotted. It is recommended to run a path order optimization tool such as vpype or axicli, this will greatly reduce plotting time.\n\nSome options can be changed via the URL:\n\n&w=.25 : The line width in millimetres.\n&d=.4 : Line density (multiplier to linewidth).\n&h=235 : Page height in millimetres. The aspect ratio is 16:9, for a width of 420mm, suitable for A3 plotting.\n\nThe line width is set to 0.25 millimetres to suit most common fine liner pen stroke widths when plotting. \n\nIf you don't intend to plot this piece, perhaps also try rendering it at 0.2 or even 0.1 millimetres line width, for an even more detailed image (it will also take longer to render).\n\n(c) 2022 by Piter Pasma",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

It's difficult for me to concentrate, especially when it comes to learning new things like p5.js. Despite the difficulty, I pushed through and managed to grasp the concepts, which was a significant accomplishment for me. To commemorate this personal milestone, I chose to incorporate the theme of focus into my first generative art token.\n\nDrawing inspiration from my childhood hobbies, I decided to represent the concept of focus by stacking stones on top of each other. As a child, I found joy in this activity, and it served as a metaphor for the determination and concentration required to overcome challenges.\n\nIn addition to my personal connection, I also drew inspiration from the Japanese culture of zen, concentration, and focus. The overall theme of my generative art token reflects these principles, paying homage to the mindset of finding inner peace and clarity through focus and concentration.\n\nBy combining my personal journey with the symbolism of stacked stones and the Japanese culture of zen, I hope to convey the importance of focus and celebrate the achievement of overcoming obstacles, especially for individuals like myself who face unique challenges in maintaining concentration.\n\nPlease press ‘2’ to ‘7’ to change the resolution (max 5600 × 7000 px).\nUse the key ’S’ to save the output as a PNG file.

Made on graph paper highlighting the technical nature of the basic design. The grid creates mathematical order and clear structure, providing a stable foundation for artistic exploration.\n\nWithin some of the squares, the shapes intertwine and overlap, giving life to the geometric vision. Triangles stand out in different directions, some dotted with circles of various diameters, while rectangles of different sizes make up intriguing compositions. The colors used are black/white and a random colour, which catch the eye and create a lively contrast.\n\nthe work challenges the viewer to perceive art even in fields usually related to mathematics and engineering. The work invites reflection on the nature of order and creativity, showing how structure and artistic freedom can coexist in harmony. the work celebrates the beauty of geometric shapes and their versatility, demonstrating that even a technical foundation can be the starting point for a unique aesthetic experience.\n\n100% code - p5.js\n\nPress left mouse button to choose density from 1 to 15 (9000x12000) (wrong results set to 1)\n\nKenzo da barra",

            "description": "I have always been impressed by the drawings of machines, boards, planets, and space maps. In my opinion, the dynamics of the lines we see in these works are very subtle, the style, the color, and the weight of each line can affect the overall picture of perception. \n\nSince 2018, I've been collecting drawings on Pinterest just for fun. I especially like the selections with spaceships, maps, robots, and boards(chip) because there are so many fine details. \n\nIn my piece called \"Symphony. Dispolarization\" I want to convey a harmonious, or relatively balanced chaos in space, just like our life from day to day we are used to what happens around us one hour, day or week can pass in an instant, based on this I show that next to one particle the world moves with unimaginable dynamics as in a symphony of great composers or, every particle, line, object, has its own rhythm. Still, even with this crazy rhythm, the picture turns out holistic, detailed, and understandable.\n\nPress >>>> \"S\" >>>> save \"IMAGE\"\n\n-Made with p5js.",

            "description": "We are filling our one and only world with our endless cities, roads and structures, for as far as the eye can see. We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it. Thank you very much for collecting and for your continuous support.\n\n10% of primary and secondary sales will go to fxhash team; thank you for what you are doing.\n\nSelf reserved pieces are for promised gifts to my collectors.\n\nPress S to save as PNG.
