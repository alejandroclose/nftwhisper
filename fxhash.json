            "description": "We cannot compose life, at best we hum along to the melodies that life has been played in front of us. Looking back at the scores of our lives, the notations are never neatly noted, but fully felt.  Rewinding the songs of life are our memories, whether sad, happy, angry, or melancholy. It is not clear whether I am dreaming or awake, but our songs all do end. \n\nIn this final drop (for ?), I have reused the first ever class calligraphy(){} I have written from my genesis drop “Nothing comes from nothing”. As time passes, 10 drops later, across almost to the year, I am grateful for the progress I have made, as an artist, and more importantly as a human. After all, what is behind the code of generative art is a human being. \n\nScores of music, scrolls of calligraphy, calendar or diary, notating life, time passes, and changes are inevitable. Sometimes we sing louder in laughter and joy, sometimes we scribble in uneasiness, sometimes we just get lost in neon lights. Life goes on. You and me, all the same and yet different.  \n\nThere are too many friend artists, friend collectors, fxhash team members, to thank for helping me through this journey. I would like to pay homage to Rudxane in this work, who has taken me under his wings, mentoring and encouraging me in art as well as showing me some degen stuff on the side:-). This homage is not copy-minting, or copying of styles, which I do not have the coding skills to do so even if I wanted to. But it is the influence of taste in many works of Rudxane. In a vague but agreeable taste, I present to you Life has no scores. \n\nWhat I was taught was disrupted, and grid studies left unfinished, and oh do we have a BINGO?\n\nTested on Chrome. Other browsers may render different or not at all (firefox)\n\nPress ‘2’ to save png.\n\nCopyright (©) 2022 Jimi Wen\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n",
