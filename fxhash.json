            "description": "A visual representation of a non-linear transformation. Each line connects a data point before the transformation has been applied to its corresponding point after the transformation has been applied. Switch to debug mode to see the untransformed and transformed points. Outline mode shows only the lines and can be used for plotting. (Plotting will likely work best on outputs where the total number of lines is low.)\n\nThe generative code is written in plain JavaScript, with the compute-intensive transformation (t-SNE) implemented in AssemblyScript and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for maximum performance. The final artwork is a static SVG file that can be downloaded and displayed at any resolution. No external libraries have been used.\n\nMore information about this collection is provided here: https://clauswilke.com/art/project/before-after\n\nI would like to thank Bartholomew Littlesilver for helpful artistic feedback, Liam Egan for help with creating plottable SVGs, and BRUTALISTI and neophob for encouraging me to pursue AssemblyScript for implementing performance-critical code.\n\nPress 'm' to cycle between normal, debug, and outline mode.\n\nPress 's' to save as svg.\n\nPress 'p' to save as png.\n\nAuthor:\nClaus O.

To do this, I analyzed various works by some abstract artists, especially some by Paul Klee. \n\nIn my recent previous works I looked for an exploration through learning new algorithms, but for this one I decided to take the classic flowfield as a starting point, trying to find a personal style from it through color.\n\nThe title “Circunvoluciones” (Circumvolutions) refers to those very characteristic shapes that can be achieved with the flowfield, by means of layers that surround each other.\n\n10 palettes with different background combinations\n1332 x 2000 pixels\n\nPress \"S\" to save a png image\nPress \"T\" to save a tiff image (may take time, canvastotiff.js)\n\ncreated by @mdollinger using p5js",

Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",

It explores ways to inspire architecture by using generative algorithms. \n\nThe construction follows a variation of the algorithm used in the first project \"Cellular Skyscrapers\". Towers originate from a 14x14 grid with 14x2 cells randomly assigned the 'alive' state. According to the cellular automaton rule chosen from the transaction hash 14 new generations are calculated and placed on top of each other.\n\nTwo new cellular automata rules have been added which tend to generate interesting housing structures. In total there are six rules listed below (in Golly notation):\n\nB3/S23 (Game of Life)\nB36/S125 (2x2)\nB368/S245 (Morley)\nB3/S234\nB2/S2\nB3/S3\n\nFeatures:\n* Cell Count\n* Color Palette (4 variations)\n* Height\n* Rule\n\nInteractions:\n* Press 'd' to export a 4000x4000px PNG File \n* Press 'c' to cycle through color palettes\n\nBuild with three.js\n\nEnjoy!",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "The Visual Code is a collection of generative art that celebrates the jazzy, dynamic visuals inspired by Wassily Kandinsky, Jackson Pollock, Kazimir Malevich, Joan Miro and The Dave Brubeck Quartet's music.\n\nEach piece uniquely expresses the artist's creativity and technical skill, showcasing the beauty and complexity of computer-generated visuals.\n\nAs a codegen artist, I am constantly in awe of the boundless potential of generative art. The ability to create unique, one-of-a-kind pieces using code is truly fascinating to me.\n\nGenerative art allows for a level of artistic expression that is simply not possible with traditional mediums. Using algorithms and mathematical principles allows for creating complex, dynamic visuals that are constantly evolving and changing.\n\nWhat I find particularly interesting about generative art is its focus on the creation process. Rather than simply producing a static, finished product, the artist is more concerned with the journey and the process of creating the art. This allows for experimentation and exploration that is impossible in more traditional forms of art.\n\nIn my own work, I strive to push the boundaries of generative art and explore new possibilities. I constantly experiment with different algorithms and techniques to create something new and unique.\n\nI am excited to continue learning and growing as an artist and to see where my passion for generative art will take me.\n\nThe collection is a tribute to the art of coding and its endless possibilities for artistic expression. From mesmerizing geometric patterns to pulsating colour fields, each piece in the collection is a testament to the endless potential of code as a medium for artistic creation.\n\nPrevious collectors are automatically on the reserve list for this exclusive collection. This is a rare opportunity to own a piece of generative art that captures the imagination and celebrates the beauty of code.\n\nPress [S] to save.",

During this time, I have released more than 160 separate collections. I am also extremely grateful to all collectors, authors, designers and artists whom I met during this time. You are wonderful people. Once again I want to express my gratitude to everyone who minted my work and help financially in such a difficult time. Each coin is very important and has played a critical role in my life.\n\nThis collection has a final cost of 0 XTZ. If suddenly you like the minted work and you want to express your gratitude, you can write to me on Twitter, retweet or mint any other work from my profile.

            "description": "Tapawingo employs a fundamental structure, essentially an isometric grid, which is constructed row by row and simultaneously rotated around a specific point. Remarkably, such a simple configuration can yield incredibly diverse, abstract results that are unique in their variation.\n\nThe resultant outputs can undergo radical changes in the final moments, frequently leading to entirely unanticipated end products. A significant level of randomness, coupled with a multitude of variables, have been seamlessly incorporated into this project, all within a remarkably straightforward framework. This truly empowers the algorithm to generate creations beyond our wildest imaginations. The code contains minimal curation, which occasionally leads to less-than-ideal outcomes. For instance, at times, the color scheme and rotation might converge in a way that leaves the canvas predominantly empty. Although this is an infrequent occurrence, it can happen.\n\nThe blocks' visual portrayal can be mentally challenging, as discerning their orientation can be tricky. It often necessitates viewing the sketch being drawn to reconcile the correct perspective.\n\nTapawingo's creations are fully responsive and are designed to display exceptionally well on high-resolution screens or when printed in large formats. The renderings adjust to the smaller dimension of your display's height or width while maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio. For greater control over the size, you can specify dimensions using URL parameters, the details of which are outlined below.\n\nThis is a free mint only because I don't want my feelings hurt. :)\n \n\nControls\n--------\n[mouse click] - start/stop the sketch\n[r] - redraw the sketch\n[s] - save a .png\n\nURL Params\n----------\n?size=xxxx where xxxx is a size in pixels you'd like to render\n\nFeatures Descriptions\n---------------------\nCell Size - the size of each cell in the grid\nColor Scheme - refers to the coloring of the left, right, top and outline for each block.\nBlock Spacing - the padding between the block and the borders of each cell.\nBlock Height Scheme - \"noisy\" blocks get their height from random noise that is smoothed using the Noise Smoothing variable and \"linear\" blocks get their height as a function of the distance from a randomly chosen block.\nMaximum Height & Amplitude - these control the height of the blocks and the disparity between those heights.\nStroke Weight - the thickness of the outlines for each block.\nRotation Type - \"noisy\" rotation gets random rotation movement using Perlin noise that is smoothed with the Noise Smoothing variable and \"linear\" rotation is constant rotation that moves in a uniform manner.\nRotate Around Center - the rotation point can either be the center of the canvas or a randomly chosen point elsewhere on the canvas.\nNoise Smoothing - used to determine how smooth or ruggedly noise driven elements of the sketch are rendered.\nSuper Blocks - with a nod to Fidenzas, this determines whether the blocks are broken up into individual blocks or traditionally rendered as one block.",
