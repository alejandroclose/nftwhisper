            "description": "Solitude is a study of negative space, contrast and void; made with 6 different particle systems. It's about the loneliness, energy dependency of our species and our interest towards monumental constructions.\n\n------\n\nIn 3541, when Solitude was far from its former glory, the high council was assembling; it's now time to find a new way to live. It has been centuries since our people started to harness the power of the stars, but they used every last bit of power to serve as a mass effort to bring people together and strengthen solidarity. But now just a few remain.. With a shortage of manpower and energy, everything decayed so quickly. Now this isolated civilization is built upon the dying stars and waiting for the eternal void. \n\nIt's time for the high council to assemble for one last time to decide what to do next…\n\n------\n\nThe first 5 collectors at the highest tier(60 xtz) will receive an airdrop of an additional edition minted by us and also will have a guaranteed reserve spot for our next collection.\n\nIn live mode, press ‘s’ to save as .png (4000 x 7111 px) - You can check the console to confirm if the render is finished.\n\nPlease beware there are some minor differences  -caused by different pixel densities- between the saved .png and work on the site.\n\nIt can take up to a minute to render or longer in low-performance computers. Enjoy the process!\n\nMade with p5.js\n\nIlgın İçözü, August 2022\n@distcollective\n",

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",
