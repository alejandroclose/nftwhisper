            "description": "PixlFlippr is an offshoot of my \"Simple Harmonic Motion\" series, inspired by the complexity of life emerging through the interaction of simple 'dumb' behaviors, with intricate details emerging on multiple scales. PixlFlippr operates on a pixel level (in the form of a GLSL frag shader).\n\nEvery pixel oscillates at a single fixed frequency, slightly out-of-sync with its neighbors. There is no explicit pixel-neighborhood communication (as there would be in eg Cellular Automata), and every pixel acts autonomously, oblivious to its surroundings. Yet collectively, the entire system exhibits constantly evolving complex high level behavior on many scales, ranging from patterns & behaviors spanning a few pixels, all the way up to the level of the entire image. These are further amplified through the emergent pixel aliasing artefacts & moir√© patterns. \n\nAlso, it's trippy af. \n\nPS All generative mints are a seamless loop with a loop duration ranging from a few minutes to over an hour. So stick around & watch it mutate!",

Will we ever be able to even fully understand ourselves?\n\n‚Äì\n\nElevation is a series of 320 generative elevation drawings of imaginary structures. It is a reminder of the limits of our consciousness, and an ode to the manifold nuances that lie beyond what we can perceive, beyond what we even can imagine.\n\nAs a generative artist, I aim to elevate my own consciousness with the help of the machine. I welcome algorithms and randomness into the creation of my works, taking full control, and intentionally giving it away, always seeking to expand my imagination. For as humans alone, we remain limited to our own edifice of thought, and often fail to free ourselves from the visible, mundane world.\n\nBoth are present in Elevation: the visible and the imaginary, the mundane and the transcendent, the solid and the fragile. Where an architect‚Äôs elevation drawing marks the transition from the thought world into the visible world, Elevation remains in-between, depicting both the idea of an imaginary structure, and the structure itself.\n\n‚Äì\n\nElevation is intended for print. All holders of an Elevation NFT will be able to order the corresponding signed print in the respective paper format via andreasrau.eu/elevation.

            "description": "Kom≈°ije,' a word meaning 'neighbors' in Serbian, is an art piece that intertwines architectural elements with the Golden Ratio (1:1.618). Inspired by the brutalist architecture of New Belgrade, Serbia, and my love for minimalism and modernism, this work explores the possibilities of this combination generatively.\n\nThe buildings of New Belgrade, a significant inspiration for this piece, exhibit a unique character. Despite their aesthetic, which may have fallen out of popular style, these structures are exceptionally solid and well-designed, having withstood the test of time. More than mere apartment blocks, they represent vertical ecosystems. Within their stark and imposing concrete forms exist a multitude of private worlds, each suspended in a communal yet distinct space, embodying the essence of interconnectedness and resilience.\n\nThe Golden Ratio, a recurring element in my creations, is a proportion frequently found in nature. It is visible in sea shell spirals and human body proportions, offering an aesthetically pleasing and comforting familiarity.\n\nIn 'Kom≈°ije,' this ratio arranges mostly residential architectural forms in elevation view, blending Mid-Century modernism, Japanese post-modernism, and Eastern European brutalism. The compositions are created by repeatedly dividing the width and height of each piece by the Golden Ratio, ensuring every element is proportionally related to the whole. This method aligns column widths and floor heights, maintaining a cohesive structure.\n\nThe artwork strikes a balance between formal architectural diagrams and hand-drawn sketches. It features generative imperfections that mimic my sketching style, fostering a sense of openness and possibility missing from formal or detailed diagrams and renders. Although the structures depicted may not be architecturally practical, they are designed to evoke a sense of wonder and joy through their playful geometry and massing.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nTENDER x Studio Yorktown\nDecember 2023\n\n'Kom≈°ije‚Äô is Serbian for ‚Äòneighbors‚Äô, and is a generative art series created by Studio Yorktown in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nKey Commands : \n\nPress ‚ÄòS‚Äô to save a high-resolution output of your structure.",

            "description": "Schwere See\n(...which is german for \"Heavy Seas\")\n\nthis work creates completely generative ocean worlds between the real and the surreal.\nwhat is real? when do we feel reality? i guess as with many other things, we feel reality best when we're deprived of it.\nThat might be the reason why it never ceases to fascinate us to both exaggerate and abstract nature and reality - maybe even at the same time.\nthat's where this work tries to go...\ngiving my best to create realistic looking waves out of hmm... thin electron-gas..., and then disrupt those from realism by unnaturally exaggerating waveforms and abstracting the display to a few colors and lines - ...well, not so few of the latter, actually ;-)\n\nbeware: this needs a good GPU (at least here in 2023) to properly run in realtime.\nstills can still be rendered on a low end machine with on-board graphics, but for realtime playing you'd need some proper dedicated graphics card.\nand of course it wont run fast (or maybe not all) on your mobile phone (except maybe on a very high end device).\n\nthe different mints vary in wave shape, color, camera view, animation speed, aspect ratio, frame style, hatching density, field of view, and more.\nsome color schemes are based on pre-chosen palettes (slightly varied though), but others are wildly random-generated. there's always some risk in randomness, but lets give the error some chance to surprise us - this is one of the many benefits of generative art.\n\nas generative art can do so much more than just generate/show an image i feel almost obliged to add the possibility to animate/inteact.\nhowever, this extra control shall not be chosen without some considerations. \nyou don't want a strobingly wild animation above your fireplace or in a doctors waiting room. nor is it motion-wise very inspiring to have subtle image stills hanging in a dancefloor.\nso, by default when in animation mode (<space>-key) the scene is very slowly and steadily changing - some pieces faster, some slower. however, by pressing <f> you can toggle to a sped up animation of waves, clouds, and scene rotation.\nbtw, going faster in nav-mode also speeds up the wave animation. (...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

            "description": "ASCII-SCAPE\n\nLike for many others growing up during the 1980s & 90s, my very first hands-on encounter with actual computer graphics (outside of games) was in the form of \"textmode\" and its various alphanumeric characters and other symbols available on the 8bit home computers of that period. These machines were perfectly capable of producing fairly high-resolution & multi-color graphics (all relative), yet most systems booted into an interactive prompt with the so-called textmode as de-facto standard environment, providing a level, if also limited, playing field for the creation of text-based graphics from a patchwork of characters & symbols of a predefined font (system or custom). As is so often the case, limitation is the mother of invention and the regular, monospaced grid and standardized set of characters quickly encouraged an entire subculture of specialized designers & artists to emerge (which is currently being re-discovered & remixed by younger generations), applying & showcasing their creativity (with often surprisingly ingenious skills) in the form of game designs, user interfaces, disk mags, demoscene productions, competitions, flyers, BBSes and even various early Web designs of the mid/late 90s.\n\nASCII-SCAPE is an attempted non-nostalgic homage to these roots & culture. It is also a textmode-only (no canvas!) rework of my previous piece C-SCAPE. It combines my love of cellular automata with the stripped back aesthetics & limitations of using only text as representation medium of these co-evolving generative systems. It required an almost complete rewrite & re-curation of various elements: 1200+ new handpicked rule combinations, 32 character sets, 40 color themes, new relationships & biases to better manage the resulting textures, densities and contrast.\n\nAlthough technically not strictly \"ASCII\" (an actual standard, but also a popular shorthand for \"text only\"), the entire simulation only uses various Unicode characters and the beautiful Iosevka open source typeface by Renzhi Li aka Belleve Invis.\n\nLike its parent C-SCAPE, this project is dynamic and evolves indefinitely. It's best viewed on non-mobile devices, where there's a decent horizontal resolution to provide sufficient simulation space. Please see the C-SCAPE project description for further details. There's no graphical export feature, but output can be captured into an UTF-8 plain text file (max. 100k lines/generations).\n\nThe following keyboard shortcuts are available:\n\n- space : toggle simulation updates (pause/play)\n- r : randomize environment\n- x : start/stop recording\n- f : toggle scroll speed (fast/slow)\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nIosevka typeface licensed under OFL-1.1 license\n\nhttps://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and https://thi.ng",
