            "description": "Abstract or non-realistic art is an activity of the mind.\nThis means that our mind abstracts some concepts from real concepts that exist outside our minds. Concepts extracted in this way have no external value.\nFor instance, the concept of human is an abstract concept that the mind abstracts from the commonalities that exist outside of our minds but exist in the real world. The concept of human being abstracted from the commonality of these people is a general concept that does not exist in the outside world.\nColor and form do not refer to any external reality and are used as the only ones available. This definition separates non-realist art from realist art. Realist art encompasses all types of paintings that evoke a reality outside the mind through form and shape.\nNon-realistic or abstract art begins when these connections are completely broken.\nThere is no reality in abstract art, it creates and creates images that we do not see in real life, and the visual elements that are used in abstract art do not exist externally in the real world. Abstract art does not introduce or represent reality. This means that it expresses a kind of composition and its own visual concepts.\nIn this art, communication is sought through a different tool and expression. The purpose of this style is to avoid profiting from, using, and displaying objects and shapes of our surroundings.\nIn this style, geometric shapes and elements (squares, rectangles, circles, triangles) are suspended in space, and intersecting lines have no trace of the real world and there are no signs of trees, rivers or living creatures, so the viewer is free to reflect on this painting only on the basis of his feelings.\nOur goal with this collection was to show a corner of this style.\nMade by p5.js\n\npress 's' to save original size",

            "description": "An important element of generative art is emergence. The most famous algorithm for this is probably Cellular Automata (CA).\n\nHowever, numerous generative artists have created works using CA, which has lost its visual freshness and is like chewing gum that has lost its taste.\n\nAlthough it is such a classic algorithm, adding my own little ideas to it and finding a new \"flavor\" is the reason why I code.\n\nHere, the subject is 1D Elementary Cellular Automata, the simplest of all cellular automata. 1D Elementary Cellular Automata has 256 different rules, which change the shapes produced. This work aims to create more complex shapes by randomly selecting some of those rules and placing multiple of them on the screen.\n\nThe on/off of the CA cell is often likened to the behavior of living creatures.As of 2022, in the country where I live, prices are rising, wages are not increasing, and COVID-19 has not yet ended. I created this work with the image of people at the mercy of these various rules.\n\n---\n\nScreen click: Change rules\nS key: Save png\nL key: Show/hide grid\n",

Through the modeling of fabrics and how they respond to being ripped, frayed, and holed, Threadbare creates a representation of the passage of time and the gradual transformation of materials. This project is part of a study by the artist to use generative art to model natural processes and materials.\n\n- You can press [1-9] to resize at multiples of 800 (i.e. 1 = 800x800, 3 = 2400x2400).\n\n- Press [d] to download as a png at anytime.\n\nCreated using p5.js",
