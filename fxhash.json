            "description": "A Cellular Dice Piece\n\nComputational modeling is the use of computers to simulate and study complex systems using mathematics, physics and computer science. A computational model contains numerous variables that characterize the system being studied. Simulation is done by adjusting the variables alone or in combination and observing the outcomes. Computer modeling allows scientists to conduct thousands of simulated experiments by computer. The thousands of computer experiments identify the handful of laboratory experiments that are most likely to solve the problem being studied.\n\nToday's sociocultural discourse might obscure the fact that humanity has been using artificial modeling techniques since ancient times. Permutations, calculus, algorithms are not exclusive to our time, but these are ubiquituous methods that can be found in many cultural entities where members of the community progress and develop their environment through cooperative decisions and consensus. Since computers were not available in the past, calculation methods, application of chance, randomness and probability were performed using other methods, like dices, sticks, cards, weather, rituals or other manifestations.\n\nDice are small, throwable objects with marked sides that can rest in multiple positions. They are used for generating random numbers, commonly as part of tabletop games, including dice games, board games, role-playing games, and games of chance. A traditional die is a cube with each of its six faces marked with a different number of dots (pips) from one to six. When thrown or rolled, the die comes to rest showing a random integer from one to six on its upper surface, with each value being equally likely. These tools were often used when a decision required to outsource human subjective elements into an objective environment.\n\nDivination can be seen as a systematic method with which to organize what appears to be disjointed, random facets of existence such that they provide insight into a problem at hand. If a distinction is to be made between divination and fortune-telling, divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a religious context, as seen in traditional African medicine. Divination has long been criticized. In the modern era, it has been dismissed by the scientific community and skeptics as being superstitious; experiments do not support the idea that divination techniques can actually predict the future more reliably or precisely than would be possible without it.\n\nThis idea is especially adaptable to the data driven belief systems of our time, where human decision making involves trust in omnipresent although obscure and biased artificial intelligence, esoteric pattern analysis, DIY heuristics, magic numbers among others. \n\nPress 'h' to switch between high/low resolution pixel density (set to low for mobiles)\n\nTouch to listen",

From a strange coordination, the micro-square society builds its habitat. Influenced by each other, they relate from a sonorous dance. And this is how the swarm lives and reveals -finally- the essence of its own machinery: vestiges and ephemeral moments before leaving.\n\n4 main audiovisual gestures of sonorous dance:\n1. Basic loop\nEach square performs quadrangle movements. It begins and ends at the same point accompanied by a sound.\n2. Contact moment\nAppears when a square reaches a corner of its path and makes contact with another square.\n3. Gesture kamikaze-release\nSometimes these \"contact moments\" result in an impact between the two squares in question, transforming both into a single gesture of fusion, and subsequent release of the swarm.\n4. Queen loop\nAppears when the queen is sighted. Main square that keeps the essence of the machinery.\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js. All sounds are synths programmed in the tone.js library.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback.

The number, size, and density of circles as well as the level of recursion, vary across pieces. The introduction of these variations and arcs adds a new dimension to fractals by juxtaposing their self-similar nature at all scales with elements of randomness.\n\nThis is my third series in a row that features a monochromatic color palette. There's something about the limitation of using only binary colors that enables me to appreciate abstraction purely for its form.\n\nNote on the name: The series draws its name from Sayed Haider Raza of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group. I have always admired Raza’s use of sacred geometry and his abstract work has forever been a source of inspiration. Raza believed that ‘Bindu’ (the dot, point or circle) is the ultimate point of creation, representing the universe in its entirety.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

            "description": "\"Layers of Noise\" is a generative art project, a collaboration between the digitally native artist Rafael Spiff and myself, Bruta currently in my creative-coding, digital abstract-expressionism form. The project focuses on the duality of our existence, typical of Rafael's explorations, while my beloved theme of perseverance and stoicism is emitted in the visual dichotomy of humanoid forms between static/stoic and chaotic elements.\n\nAs a collaborative empath you can see I have drawn from Rafael's visual style, but also I have to admit that another important influence is the pioneer of animated noise algorithms Kim Asendorf.\n\nThe \"Layers of Noise\" system goes beyond the mere complexity of algorithms and focuses on the expressive use of experimentation. It uses the usual suspects - elements of Random and Perlin noise, Clifford based flow fields and some basic Math. These mathematical underpinnings are then creatively shattered using the Canvas API in unprecedented and unconventional ways, resulting in analog-like glitches and captivating deformations.\n\nRafael's exploration of the tension between order and disorder in the human mind finds its perfect counterpart in the generative system's underlying theme of persistence and perseverance. The static humanoid shapes, meticulously crafted by Rafael, symbolize strength and determination, serving as anchors against the infinite layers of noise that pervade the artwork. This juxtaposition evokes a sense of wonder and contemplation, inviting viewers to delve into the intricate depths of the human experience.\n\n\"Layers of Noise\" pushes artistic expression forward, creating a collection of animated artworks that transcend traditional notions of plotting centered generative art into the more digitally native direction of glitch and gif mediums. Each piece is a vibrant manifestation of the human spirit, capturing the beauty, complexity, and resilience inherent in our existence.\n\n\n*In the creation of every output are used three static prerendered assets in the form of .png digital artworks crafted by Rafael Spiff. Every other color, shape, pattern, background animated or not is generated live by the generative system.\n\n*P5.js and Canvas API are mixed in the code.\n\nThe project is implementing fxhash features connected tightly with the visual output, having the craziest outputs being the most rare.\n\nProject is tested and on most popular desktop browsers for Windows.\n\nKeys:\n\n- Click over the screen for a little zoom in into the textures.\n- Press \"s\" for static image download.\n- Press \"g\" to download 3 sec animated .gif.\n- Press \"n\" to Stop/Start animation.\n\n\nThank you!",
