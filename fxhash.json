            "description": "“Klyft” is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at PARIS+ par Art Basel.\n\nKlyft is a juxtaposition of two different projections for the future. One, made by the World Economic Forum, suggests that the global gender gap will have closed by the year 2154. The other, by the UN IPCC, estimates that global warming will reach 3.2 degrees celcius by the year 2100.\n\nKlyft makes use of the unique temporal aspect of computational art by developing its expression gradually over the next 132 years. As we come closer to 2154, the space between the two shapes in Klyft will grow smaller to symbolize the closing of the gender gap. As time goes on, however, Klyft also becomes more and more glitched out to represent the projected increases in greenhouse gases and climate catastrophes.\n\nIn the end, Klyft’s expression will be heavily corrupted, and the two shapes will have reached each other.\n\n· URL parameters ·\n\nYou can add the following parameters to the URL to change the behavior of the piece.\n\ndate=<YYYY-MM-DD> — See how Klyft looks on another day. Use the format YYYY-MM-DD. \n\ncolor=<number> — See the piece in another color scheme. The numbers loop around, so 17 equals 0, 18 equals 1, etc. \n\nresolution=<number> — View the piece in a higher resolution. 1 is normal resolution, 2 is double, etc. No decimals allowed.\n\nimage=true — Save the piece as an image. \n\nrecord=true — Save the piece as a video in WEBM format.\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will show Klyft in double resolution on the day gender equality is achieved according to the WEF:\n\ndate=2154-01-01&resolution=2\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will save a video of Klyft in the ‘Stokkendahl Dalgas’ color scheme:\n\ncolor=14&record=true\n\n· Interactions ·\n\nPressing the following keys will trigger functionality as well as add related URL parameters automatically. \n\nPressing D will increment the date by 1 year.\n\nPressing C will increment the color index by 1.\n\nPressing R will toggle between normal and double resolution.\n\nPressing I will toggle the image URL parameter, which saves the piece as an image. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nPressing V will toggle the video URL parameter, which saves the piece as a video. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nThere are secret key presses as well. Some of them only work outside of iframe. \n\n· Accessibility ·\n\nKlyft is built to support screen readers. It has been tested using MacOS’ VoiceOver, and uses p5.js’ describeElement() to provide screen reader functionality.\n\nIf you have any comments (good or bad) on the screen reader integration, don’t hesitate to reach out on my Twitter: @ada_ada_ada_art. \n\n· Credits and license ·\n\nKlyft is made with p5.js.\n\nKlyft is licensed under a modified version of the Climate Strike License (CSL).",

As you gaze into their world, let these haunting apparitions remind you of the vastness of the cosmos. \n\nThe SENTINELS beckon you to explore the sinister beauty of the abyss, to question, and to wander through a digital realm where the eerie and the captivating coexist.\n\nParanoia is a necessary skill whenever a SENTINEL is involved.\n \nSENTINELS is not only an exploration of the sublime-it also empowers collectors to generate physical artifacts from the void.

            "description": "Giorgio de Chirico was a prominent influence on the Surrealist movement. De Chirico’s art portrays dream-like and distorted worlds that encourage viewers to explore their subconscious. \n\nI am fascinated by the different ways artists have found to express esoteric concepts. In particular, I am interested in how artists like Giorgio de Chirico have used light and color to create ethereal images. \n\nI believe that the Abstract Temples project is a perfect example of how generative art can be used to create metaphysical artwork. By invoking the visual language of the dream world, these images invite you to explore the nebulous relationship between external and internal space.\n\nIn addition to the influence of Giorgio de Chirico, I would also like to credit James Turrell as an inspiration for this project. Turrell is an artist who creates installations that play with our perception of light and space. Turrell’s work has profoundly impacted my understanding of how art can create an immersive and disorienting experience. \n\nEach temple room is randomly generated from a selection of 16 templates. The templates include a variety of randomized features, including the color palette, celestial objects, design variations, and other effects. They also contain a rare secret. \n\nThis project was created with p5js. \n\nFeatures:\n-16 room templates\n-18 color palettes\n-Celestial objects\n-Secrets",

These are not friendly guides; they are silent arbiters of the unknown, both protectors and judges of the enigma that is their terrain. As you gaze into their world, let these haunting apparitions remind you of the vastness of the cosmos. \n\nThe SENTINELS beckon you to explore the sinister beauty of the abyss, to question, and to wander through a digital realm where the eerie and the captivating coexist.\n\nParanoia is a necessary skill whenever a SENTINEL is involved.\n \nSENTINELS is not only an exploration of the sublime-it also empowers collectors to generate physical artifacts from the void. With a keystroke, you choose your format:\n\nPress ‘s’ or ‘1’ to save a compact version\n‘2’ for a print-ready image\n‘3’ for a high-resolution image",

The gentle rushing of the water. \n\nThe sea with its vast panorama's can make you feel insignificant in the grand scheme of things. But this piece is about hope.\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nAbout this reissue: An update of the security policy of fx(hash) blocks external scripts. This update stops malicious actors; they could try to interact with a user’s wallet. So, this update is really a good thing. It’s a safeguard. However, due to this update the original project no longer loads in live view and after consultation and deliberation I decided to reissue the token without the use of external scripts (p5js). \n\nOnly holders of the original project are on the allow list. \n\nRoyalties are for the minter.  \n",

            "description": "“We are segmented from all around and in every direction. The human being is a segmentary animal. Segmentarity is inherent to all the strata composing us. Dwelling, getting around, working, playing: life is spatially and socially segmented. The house is segmented according to its rooms’ assigned purposes; streets, according to the order of the city; the factory, according to the nature of the work and operations performed in it. We are segmented in a binary fashion, following the great major dualist oppositions: social classes, but also men-women, adult-children, and so on.” \n\n-a thousand plateaus: capitalism and schizophrenia, Deleuze and Guattari\n\nLinear Segmentarity explores the concept of a segmented existence, which refers to how our lives are broken up into discreet parts or segments.\n\nI was inspired by the philosophers Deleuze and Guattari. These thinkers studied the ways we are segmented into work and play, family and friends, and past and present. We move through our days in a series of linear segments, each one leading to the next. \n\nEach segment has its territory with its own rules and way of doing things. We are constantly shifting from one to the next, and the sum of these segments defines our existence. \n\nArt can help us visualize this hidden aspect of ourselves and feel its impact. Using Javascript to describe the sporadic nature of the world, this project invites us to see the linear segmentarity at work in our environment.\n",

The collection borrows its name from a 1919 short-story cycle by Sherwood Anderson, which explores a peculiar cast of characters living within a fictionalized, midwestern town. Like Anderson’s text, the “Winesburg, Ohio” algorithm constructs a world through recurring portrayals of specific structures and landmarks. Its scenes are populated by a variety of familiar elements taken from my larger body of work, including water towers, houses, and churches. Meanwhile, a series of scripted gestures insert abstract compositional elements into the outputs, counteracting their pictorial legibility. The strange landscapes that result are composite ideograms, comprised of multiple spatial possibilities that co-exist in varying states of contradiction.",

I wanted them all to fuse together into a living spirit.\" - Clyfford Still\n\n\nI have spent most of my life residing in urban environments. While figurative art is not a style I typically pursue in my own work, I delight in discovering abstract elements within it. The cities I've inhabited have consistently offered me the chance to do so through their architectural landscapes.\n\nLe Corbusier once said that a metropolis's abstract skyline serves as its autobiography, etched in steel and glass, unveiling its history, character, and ambitions. In this series, my aim has been to encapsulate that sentiment using a minimalistic canvas and a monochromatic palette. Abstract expressionism remains my lens for viewing every artwork. \n\nThe style of this series is my homage to Clyfford Still, an abex artist I have always admired. His ability to convey profound meaning through seemingly empty and unfilled canvases has always intrigued me. \n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress s to save the image in full screen. \n\nPixel Love!",
