            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

            "description": "I met an old man at the bar in a pub in Ireland. As it usually happens after a few pints of Guinness we started talking. \n\nHe said how he spent his entire working life on an ocean-going ship, was in danger many times due to storms, and how he couldn't wait to retire and firmly set foot on land, finally spending time with his family, especially grandchildren. \n\nAnd that now as an old man, he is happiest on summer evenings, when the full moon lights up everything, he lies out on the grassy part of the beach and looks at the sea through the grass. I asked him why through the grass? He said - \"I can't live without the sea, and looking at it through the grass is solid proof that I'm really on land after so many years, and that I'm not dreaming after all.\" \n\nThis work is a dedication to that old man. I recently found out from my Irish friends that he died few months ago at age of 87. His ashes were scattered on the grassy part of the beach. Now he is forever close to his sea, but still firmly on land, which he has been striving for for years.\n\nSláinte mr. Doyle.\n\nMade in p5.js\nBajiru, November 2022.",

            "description": "Kyma (/kee-ma/, κύμα) is a Greek word meaning wave. It is my exploration of an acoustic phenomenon known as ‘Chladni Patterns’. \n\nErnst Florens Friedrich Chladni was a German physicist and musician. He was a pioneer of modern acoustics and made numerous contributions to the field. Chladni's work had a significant influence on the development of modern music theory and the technology of musical instruments. In 1787, Chladni was trying to understand how sound waves propagate and interact with objects. By vibrating a metal plate and sprinkling sand on it, he observed that the sand arranged itself into distinct patterns. These patterns are created due to the interaction between the sound waves and the plate: the sound waves cause the plate to vibrate, which in turn causes the sand to move. The sand will move away from areas of high vibration and towards areas of low vibration. This creates a unique pattern of ridges, circles, and many other shapes.\n\nKyma continues this study by adding color, light, and composition to the equation. Each iteration is a unique combination of two Chladni plates with different characteristics, accompanied by a palette, background lighting, and variational drawing algorithm. Plates interact with each other, forming patterns from the small detailed net-like grid to megalithic sculptures of unknown creatures and windows to another worlds.\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.\n\nRendering can be computationally heavy, please be patient and give it some time to draw.\nChrome is highly recommended for live mode and high res saving.\n\nMade with love, math, and p5js. \n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG 2400 x 1600\n[2] - save PNG 4800 x 3200\n[3] - save PNG 9600 x 6400\n[4] - save PNG 14400 x 9600",

It was a dream to be able to make a collection of Dots on Fxhash, now it finally happened. Initially we only had 1 color palette, however, to create more variety, this project has 7 color palettes. To create the palettes we chose 5 famous artists to honor, including Peter Halley, Max Bill, Piet Mondrian, Sophie Taeuber and Lygia Clark, in addition to the palettes created by us. The project has several grids and some new possibilities in addition to the pieces already created on other platforms. It is with great pride and joy that we present this project made with great affection. Enjoy!\n\nPress [S] to save a image",

            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

            "description": "This is an algorithmic tribute to the pioneering work of Anna Atkins (1799-1871). Considered by many the first female photographer, Atkins learned about the cyanotype process soon after it was invented by John Herschel, a family friend. As a botanist, she had the idea of using the new technique to produce contact prints of plants. Her investigations succeeded in capturing the nuances in morphology and the delicate details of many species.\n\nIn 1843 she published “British Algae: Cyanotype impressions”, the first published book to use a photographic process for the illustrations. Each copy gathered around 400 prints, each of them individually produced from a different specimen. Thus, all books featured the same species, but each of them was different, in a process that was itself generative in a certain way. Today, about 17 copies of the book are preserved in different institutions. Atkins went on to publish two more books in the following years, with the help of her friend Anne Dixon, dedicated to various ferns and plants.\n\n“Cyanotypes” pays homage to her wonderful work, which sits at the intersection between science and art, and used technology in a novel way to capture the beauty of nature. Here things are taken one step forward, to generate algorithmic simulations of plants, ferns, and algae, which are the work of fantasy and not necessarily faithful to the traits of any real species.\n\nThe work features 28 basic configurations, each of them in turn capable of unlimited variations. As was the case with the prints from “British Algae”, every image is at the same time part of a series and unique. \n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 800 x 1000 resolution. Please note that rendering at high resolutions can be very slow.\n\nMade with p5.js. \n",

            "description": "The story behind this collection is that there isn't really a story behind this collection. It is the result of play, tinkering, and curiosity.\n\nOne of the beautiful things about generative art is how we can achieve drastically different results simply by modifying a few parameters or lines of code. As my first release here on fxhash was 'Sabler', it felt fitting that my release for #fxhashturnsone would itself be a modified version of that 'Sabler' algorithm, albeit giving drastically different results.\n\nIt is notable for the fact that this is perhaps my most 'chaotic' collection yet, letting go of carefully considered proportions, angles and positioning and here leaving that in the hands of the computer. In a way, this simple act represents several design decisions I never would have imagined myself making a year ago, highlighting my growth as a generative artist over the past year.\n\nIt is also a reflection of the inspiration gained from many of the artists and boundary-pushers in the space that each time unlock and encourage creations beyond the immediate comfort zone. For that, this is a 'Thank You' to all of you.\n\nWith that, here's to many more years of generative beauty and inspiration on fxhash and beyond.\n\nAs with previous collections, I highly recommend viewing the images at full size and savouring the details and the chaos up close. Pressing 'S' will save a 6000 x 6000 px PNG file.\n\n50% of primary sales will be donated to the Processing Foundation.",
