However, just the dots themselves are often considered too simple to have as a project on their own.\n\nGiven the limited amount of time for a 12-hour speed run, I decided to see if I could take something as simple as dots and inject just a little bit of GenArt personality into it. Adding textures, variations and controlled colour selection.\n\nIt's about as simple you can get with dots on a grid, without being simple. This is my [speed run] version, show me yours.\n\n## SPEED RUN\n\nThe tradition of doing a \"speed run\" on fxhash was started by Alexis André (@MacTuitui) and his \"fxhash SpeedRun: any% < 960 minutes\" project (#11995), described as \"A performance piece.

            "description": "The concept of organic, obtained from living systems, is said to be an effect that, like a plant and a living being, has grown in a completely dynamic manner in different degrees, and no factor except vital forces has prevented its growth. Organic creation is an example of this type. Léonard de Vinci believed in nature; he wrote, \"Painting is a child of nature\" in his opinion, art should be compatible with nature. His public image of creativity was \"innovation while maintaining fidelity\" to nature. According to Michelangelo, the form the artist gives to the materials is in the artist's mind and the materials themselves. Therefore, the artist is always in a metaphysical struggle with the form and secrets of nature. This is a revelatory process through which the artist discovers the mass of paper already hidden in his mind and the materials. As an architect, I tried to create this work while paying attention to the structuralism of shapes and forms in creation, inspired by the colors in nature and my experience in painting and illustration.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of royalty on each secondary sale.\nEighteen different color palettes and three different borders are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated August 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "M'Fing Dots on a M'Fing Grid was an fxhash speedrun any% < 720 minutes project. Started at 10:30am Fri 5th August 2022, and finished at 10:30pm Fri 5th August 2022.\n\nThe repo for the code base can be found at: https://github.com/revdancatt/mfing-dots-on-a-mfing-grid - progress of writing code over the 12 hours can be seen in the commit history.\n\n## THE PROJECT\n\nThe idea behind the project was to take one of the simplest things in generative art, randomly coloured dots on a grid.\n\nMany projects use dots on a grid as the base foundation for building more complexity. However, just the dots themselves are often considered too simple to have as a project on their own.\n\nGiven the limited amount of time for a 12-hour speed run, I decided to see if I could take something as simple as dots and inject just a little bit of GenArt personality into it. Adding textures, variations and controlled colour selection.\n\nIt's about as simple you can get with dots on a grid, without being simple. This is my [speed run] version, show me yours.\n\n## SPEED RUN\n\nThe tradition of doing a \"speed run\" on fxhash was started by Alexis André (@MacTuitui) and his \"fxhash SpeedRun: any% < 960 minutes\" project (#11995), described as \"A performance piece. From cloning the template to a decent piece in less than 960 minutes\".\n\nTwo more speed run collections have been created \"Consequence Broadcast\" (#13359) and \"Beacon\" (#17542) both by Amy Goodchild.\n\nThis is a fxhash speedrun any% < 720 run.\n\nThe any% is from game speed running and means \"to get to the end with any % finished\", meaning you don't have to 100% complete the game, just get to the end credits. For a gen art project it means you can use libraries and copy bits and bobs from your previous code, without having to do everything from scratch.\n\n< 720 means that it's done in less than 720 minutes, in this case 12 hours.",

            "description": "Gerhard is a collaboration of Richard Nadler and Leander Herzog on fxhash. A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time. \nRichard Nadler created the textures to control composition and color. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels. This collaboration is enabled by twitter and fxhash, as the generative art community continues to explore abstraction in summer 2022 – while extreme temperatures, wildfires, ongoing conflicts and volatile markets continue to escalate. \n\n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color. \n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen mode. \n- Press “s” to save the current canvas. \n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nhttps://leanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/",

            "description": "Gerhard is a collaboration of Richard Nadler and Leander Herzog on fxhash. A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time. \nRichard Nadler created the textures to control composition and color. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels. This collaboration is enabled by twitter and fxhash, as the generative art community continues to explore abstraction in summer 2022 – while extreme temperatures, wildfires, ongoing conflicts and volatile markets continue to escalate. \n\n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color. \n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen mode. \n- Press “s” to save the current canvas. \n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nhttps://leanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/",

And while we devise systems for solving unfathomably complex problems, generating algorithmic creativity, and unlocking regenerative biological possibilities, we simultaneously cling to the power and originality of emotional feeling – believing it to be the irreplaceable source of what makes us human.\n\nIf the body is our shell for emotion and soul, can an artificial humanoid be another vessel for these thoughts and feelings – for human essence itself? If our ‘soul’ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable? That we may see answers to these questions looks more real every year, and is perhaps a little frightening. \n\nEmotional Shell uses introspective portraits of future selves to question what it means to be human, when the people around us are no longer human.\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 1-3 to select from low, medium, and high quality settings\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2400px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nTENDER x wwatkns\nAugust 2022",

            "description": "The concept of organic, obtained from living systems, is said to be an effect that, like a plant and a living being, has grown in a completely dynamic manner in different degrees, and no factor except vital forces has prevented its growth. Organic creation is an example of this type. Léonard de Vinci believed in nature; he wrote, \"Painting is a child of nature\" in his opinion, art should be compatible with nature. His public image of creativity was \"innovation while maintaining fidelity\" to nature. According to Michelangelo, the form the artist gives to the materials is in the artist's mind and the materials themselves. Therefore, the artist is always in a metaphysical struggle with the form and secrets of nature. This is a revelatory process through which the artist discovers the mass of paper already hidden in his mind and the materials. As an architect, I tried to create this work while paying attention to the structuralism of shapes and forms in creation, inspired by the colors in nature and my experience in painting and illustration.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of royalty on each secondary sale.\nEighteen different color palettes and three different borders are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated August 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

They live a cyclical life marked by two big stages during their livestock year: \"La Veranada\" and \"La Invernada\".\nThe \"invernada\" is the place where they live during what we could call the long winter, that is, from April to November. \"La Invernada\" is below, in the plains, in the pampas, in accessible places, where it is easy to supply the animals with fodder.\n\"La Veranada\" is the place where they go during the long summer, from November to April, it is above, in the mountain ranges, on the heights, where the summer pastures abound, where they go for months to take care, alone, of the goats, cows and calves.\nThe transfer of the animals to the summer pasture is called \"Arreo\", my mother's husband guides the animals on his horse. The \"Arreo\" lasts about 5 days.\nIn both places they live in what they call \"el puesto\". \"El puesto\" is their home.\nIn \"La veranada\", \"El puesto\" is simple. A common living room, with a wood stove, a table, some chairs and shelves to store flour, *\"mate\" and salt. A small bedroom replenishes the strength worn out by the daily work. Water for drinking, cooking and washing is drawn from a nearby stream.\nWork is abundant. As a common element, both in winter and summer, my mother's husband rides a horse daily and, accompanied by his dogs, goes to \"watch\" the cattle.\nAs a final point I wanted to thank you for taking your time and reading the story behind this project that I really enjoyed doing it, and on my tw profile you can read this story with real photos.\n\n*Mate: is an Argentinean infusion, which is present all day long in the life of people who live in the countryside. It give you energy.\n\nPress \"S\" in live mode to save image 2600 x 3000.\nPlease note that the algorithm can take some time to run.\nCreated by Fernando. NFT License 2.0.",
