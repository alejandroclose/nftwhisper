            "description": "“Take Wing” is a generative art collection depicting the hope, optimism, and thrilling excitement of a person taking off, gaining traction, and soaring to new heights and off into the great unknown.  \n\nThe algorithm behind the piece stems from an attempt to go back to art fundamentals and codify composition rules and painterly techniques into a generative form - taking into account focal points, contrast, eye movement, and color theory while still giving the algorithm freedom to explore random color palettes, random flow field movement, random brush strokes, and many other degrees of freedom.\n\nThe collection is made in pure code with p5.js and a few GLSL fragment shaders.\n\nThe piece has been created to be exhibited at \"In Touch\" with VerticalCryptoArt in Berlin in September 2022, curated by Anika Meier.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo get a (somewhat) high-resolution output, open the live view of your token, and then edit the URL adding &h=5400 at the end of it.  5400 is the tallest you can go, but you can also put a smaller number if you desire.  Be aware that this will only work on a machine with a very beefy GPU, and even then may take a bit, so please be patient!",

It began as a study of points of light, with geometric objects in the background. The background objects developed a life of their own and then birds, and ships, made out of bezier shapes became the focal points. Then everything got lost in clouds before the collection as it stands now emerged. Aside from the published traits, many of the artifacts created on the way are still generated. For example, star fields, birds, sonars and gas bubbles. These are sometimes visible, but when they appear, it is simply by some chaotic chance.\n\nThis collection has been coded with P5js and WebGL.

Eliot\n\n---\n\nAlpinism is a tribute to the rugged and wild landscapes that rise around us. Which may at once intrigue, impress, intimidate, and inspire.\n\nI am captivated by the mythology of these settings. Where natural shapes appear fantastical. A ridge line drawn by pen meets sky poured out from neon gradient. Where observation is made through the lens of imagination.\n\nEach piece begins with the concept of a mountain landscape. A number of ranges are drawn by pen in one of three styles. Within each style is a spectrum of variation that produces different drawn qualities. The backdrop may be an imagined sky, an impossible sunset, a piece of parchment. A testament to the interpreter’s memory of the scene. \n\n---\n- Made with p5js in the White Mountains of NH July 2022\n- press s to save png\n",

            "description": "And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses\nHad the look of flowers that are looked at.\n- T.S. Eliot, Four Quartets: Burnt Norton (1936)\n\nThis work is an attempt to encapsulate in an algorithm, not the likeness of a flower, but the likeness of a painting of a flower. If, according to a very old definition, art is an imitation of nature, this is an imitation of an imitation – a sort of meta-imitation of nature by means of computer code.\n\nThe challenge for this piece was to capture some of the looseness and fluidity of the human hand when holding a brush or a pencil, and reproducing some typical forms of hand-made scribbles, doodles and brush strokes. However, absent the materiality of paint and canvas, everything is simulated here on the base of a very simple resource: circles. Everything you see is built of very many overlapping circles of varying sizes, colors and opacities. It is circles all the way down…\n\nInspiration for this work comes from a number of expressionist painters, from 20th century classics like Cy Twombly, to the magnificent contemporary work of Philip Maltman: https://www.instagram.com/philipmaltman/\n\nThis work is animated.\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 1000 x 1000 resolution. Please note that rendering at high resolutions can be slow.\n\nMade with the open-source libraries p5.js and chroma.js\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses\nHad the look of flowers that are looked at.\n- T.S. Eliot, Four Quartets: Burnt Norton (1936)\n\nThis work is an attempt to encapsulate in an algorithm, not the likeness of a flower, but the likeness of a painting of a flower. If, according to a very old definition, art is an imitation of nature, this is an imitation of an imitation – a sort of meta-imitation of nature by means of computer code.\n\nThe challenge for this piece was to capture some of the looseness and fluidity of the human hand when holding a brush or a pencil, and reproducing some typical forms of hand-made scribbles, doodles and brush strokes. However, absent the materiality of paint and canvas, everything is simulated here on the base of a very simple resource: circles. Everything you see is built of very many overlapping circles of varying sizes, colors and opacities. It is circles all the way down…\n\nInspiration for this work comes from a number of expressionist painters, from 20th century classics like Cy Twombly, to the magnificent contemporary work of Philip Maltman: https://www.instagram.com/philipmaltman/\n\nThis work is animated.\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 1000 x 1000 resolution. Please note that rendering at high resolutions can be slow.\n\nMade with the open-source libraries p5.js and chroma.js\n",

            "description": "Does time traveling on Earth or a time machine in real life?\n\nFuture travel is a possibility! We frequently carry it out! I'm moving forward at the speed of one second per second while I type this. No machine is necessary. But you just have to go faster if you want to get to the future faster.\n\nOur project presents the most revolutionized time machine in the advanced parallel universe. The quantum time machine creation was based on the invention of the last piece of the puzzle ever searched for; \"Fastium\" the darkest and the strongest matter ever. The time machine has twelve stratum; each one is a complex mechanical power field based on pinions created by liquefying the Fastium, whose melting point is the Planck temperature, then crystallizes the Fastium by putting it into the absolute zero states; by passing through this complex process, the pinions made of Fastium have gained the capacity to rotate surpassing the speed of light. The simultaneous inversed rotation of each stratum of pinions distorts space-time, and magically each pinion causes its distortion procreating it in twelve dimensions. The distortion of space-time in all twelve dimensions at once is a rare instance that can travel you through an unknown future that may be the end of all existence; you have to be cautious. Each number of dimensions distorted spawns a destination in a futuristic time that you can jump to.\n\nIf you encounter a specific \"Time Machine\" that you've liked, you can pause the switching effects by clicking \"the left mouse button\"\n\nCreated using vanilla javascript\nKrouniHatim - Nov22\n---\n(CC BY-ND 4.0)",
