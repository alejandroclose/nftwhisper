            "description": "In this 100% code generated bloom project, I made many new attempts to combine photography elements into generative art.\n\nFirst at all, I love the images of early wet plate collodion photography (published in 1851 by Frederick Scott Archer), so I tried to make these artworks look similar.\n\nTo have the image more photography aesthetic, depth of field is an important factor. I put lots of effort into making it fully present in these images.\n\nFurthermore, I think these days few have an experience of darkroom processes, therefore I also tried to make an algorithm of animations to simulation the developing process that darkroom workers are obsessed with.\n\nAnd finally, the most important thing, why I chose rose as the protagonist? The answer is pretty simple, because I want to present these artworks of 99 roses to my dear wife.\n\nMade with p5.js/WebGL.\n\nNote: the frame of the image might be different for different GPU system.\n",

The hidden secrets of these Ordinary Places can only be revealed through the minting process. In this sense, the outputs are not merely a collection individual scenes, but instead, a coherent world animated by shared themes and narratives.     \n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",

            "description": "'Part:Counterpart' is an experiment in form, disintegration, and context. Each work is created within one of three modes, Part, Counterpart, or Part:Counterpart.\n\nIn experimenting, I've enjoyed taking a simple composition and breaking it down with various methods. This transforms the original composition into something new, but it also begins to lose what the original had to say. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I want to dive a little deeper and explore ideas as a sort of tangible substance. Already we're comparing ideas against their translations and evolutions, but what happens if we present them both within the context of the other?\n\nAdditionally, what if we present both of these ideas with echoes and tangents, discussion around the ideas and their practical applications instead of imagined? Sure, these aren't our idea, or even our translation, but they exist only because the originals do.\n\nHow does this change our opinion of the original? Is every idea destined to be picked apart and reimagined forever until it bears only a faint resemblance? Where is the line between our Counterpart and an echo?\n\nThis piece hopes to inspire contemplation on the nature of storytelling and artistic inspiration.\n\n10% of ideas are encrypted to obscure the original Part.\nPress ’s’ to save a 3600x4500 png.\nPress ‘p’ to save the original Part, pure and untouched.",

Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "In this 100% code generated bloom project, I made many new attempts to combine photography elements into generative art.\n\nFirst at all, I love the images of early wet plate collodion photography (published in 1851 by Frederick Scott Archer), so I tried to make these artworks look similar.\n\nTo have the image more photography aesthetic, depth of field is an important factor. I put lots of effort into making it fully present in these images.\n\nFurthermore, I think these days few have an experience of darkroom processes, therefore I also tried to make an algorithm of animations to simulation the developing process that darkroom workers are obsessed with.\n\nAnd finally, the most important thing, why I chose rose as the protagonist? The answer is pretty simple, because I want to present these artworks of 99 roses to my dear wife.\n\nMade with p5.js/WebGL.\n\nNote: the frame of the image might be different for different GPU system.\n",
