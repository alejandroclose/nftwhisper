            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines II. Enfantillages Pittoresques” is the second of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Enfantillages Pittoresques” experiments with predefined plots, colour blending, webgl shaders, and generative music; all with a fresh, childish style. This algorithm has been trained to draw basic shapes in accordance to Satie’s lyrics. However, it uses them in unusual ways and creates what looks like fantastic creatures, microscopic beings, or, to follow Corneille, Constant, and Appel: \"human animals\".\n\n“It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child” Attributed to Picasso (falsely, probably)\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines” are best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, these have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\nPress M or Double Tap (mobile) for AUDIO mode\nWait for SILENT mode\nPress I for Trait Info (desktop)\nPress 1 for Canvas Save (desktop)\n\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=171” after URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=X” for HQ renders (standard is 2, and 8 produces 400ppi 40x44cm prints).\n\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been compressed and minified for a performance boost, but can be read fully in GitHub: https://github.com/ratchitect/\n\n\n# PERFORMANCE\nBetter experienced with Chrome.",

            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

These pigments are arranged in multiple layers, each layer using a different color from one of the carefully curated color palettes. Each palette consists of three to five colors. \n\nAs the pigments are shifted by random noise, new hues and patterns emerge, creating a lovely display of color and movement.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[5] to change the resolution.\n- Press [s] to save a png file at the current resolution.\n\nThis is my first generative art project. Created with p5js.\n\n________\n\nLooks best on high-resolution screens and viewed in live mode. When displayed on a low-resolution screen, an unintended moiré pattern may appear.",

            "description": "After 4 months of coding the Generative Glasses is ready! I gained a lot of experience along the way and I really liked the creation process.\n\nI wrote an article in which I report on the creation process in more detail. It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\n👓 thousands of different outputs are possible\n👨‍💻 only code\n🎨 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \n🎥 animated\n🖱️ interactive (+controls for mobile)\n😎 augmented reality view\n🟥 different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\n🖼️ save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\n📼 save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress “5” to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress “6” to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress “7” to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress “8” to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress “ArrowDown” for restores the original camera view\nPress “D” to switch to next composition\nPress “A” to switch  to previous composition\nPress “S” to start animation\nPress “Spacebar” to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress “1” to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress “2” to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress “3” to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention! Thanks for the support! Thanks for the opportunity fxhash and genart community! I hope I was able to contribute to generative art with my work!\n\n@C4RC0\ncarco.hu",

            "description": "fx(elevate) is a cry for parity within our community for underrepresented groups. It is released in conjunction with fx(fam) 003, our third community town hall.  Like all my 2023 releases, previous collectors of my work may collect it for free. In fact, anyone may collect it for free.  But, there is a catch.  This is not intended as a fleeting show of generic support.  It’s a personal challenge.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to elevate the artist named in your edition. Here is how it works.  Collect an edition and watch your new piece of art build.  Open it in live mode and press R.  The name of an artist will appear.  This the artist you are asked to elevate.  The artist names are from the two lists found on fxfeed.xyz: “women in genart” & “lgbtqia2s+ in genart” (see full list below).  The names themselves are fx(hash) user names, facilitating easy location of their work.\n\nHow do you elevate? Here are some ideas:\n. Explore the artist’s work, commit their name to memory, and watch for opportunities to support them\n. Follow the artist on fxfeed and social media\n. Post about and engage in discussions about the artist’s work on social media\n. Take every opportunity to ask that the artist be included in events, panel discussions, podcasts, curated exhibits, newsletters, etc.\n. Collect the artist’s work if you have the means\n. List the work you’ve collected and help build the secondary market for the artist\n. Explore fx(elevate) editions collected by others, commit the names of those artists to memory, elevate them, repeat.\n\nIf we draw attention to, and train our influence on, these important members of the fx(family), we will be the change!\n\nThe other major feature of the work is the palette.  There are twelve choices, exposed as a feature, and each one is associated with an aspirational characteristic of our community.  You can take up the challenge of emphasizing this characteristic in yet another way of elevating our shared goal.\n\nThis work could not have been completed without the support of the fx team and two wonderful members of our fx(hash) community, cari ann shim sham* and louis. My undying love and respect always. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in April, 2023.\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [R] in live mode to reveal the name of an artist to elevate.\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution file suitable for printing.

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "AERO\n\nIn the stillness of the void, floating cities hang suspended, bound by no earthly gravity. The buildings, wrought in shades of dreamy pastels, appear as though they have been plucked from some other time and place, and set adrift in a new and unknowable realm.\n\nHere, amidst the stillness and silence, ropes hang loosely like vines, connecting the structures in a delicate web of possibility. The architecture of the buildings is vaguely familiar, yet strangely surreal, hinting at a past now forgotten.\n\nAs the eye wanders through this landscape of suspended structures, a feeling of nostalgia begins to seep in. There is a sense that these cities were once inhabited, bustling with the energy of human life. Now, they stand alone, abandoned and forgotten, as nature slowly reclaims its territory.\n\n\n\nThe AERO series explores how a minimalistic set of shapes and rules can be extrapolated to create complex assemblies, the same way individual buildings will form villages and cities.\n\nTo add a sense of organic texture to these geometric structures, ropes that connect certain squares have been added. They can sometimes take on the appearance of vines. This addition aims creates a sense of tension between the man-made and the natural.\n\n\n\nDouble click or double tap to save the current image\n\nIn fullscreen mode / live view:\nAdd \"&size=xxxx\" at the end of the url to generate a custom sized image\nAdd \"&clean\" at the end of the url to remove the grain effect\n\n\nArtist: Estienne\nFeb. 2023\nLicense: NFT 2.0",

            "description": "fx(elevate) is a cry for parity within our community for underrepresented groups. It is released in conjunction with fx(fam) 003, our third community town hall.  Like all my 2023 releases, previous collectors of my work may collect it for free. In fact, anyone may collect it for free.  But, there is a catch.  This is not intended as a fleeting show of generic support.  It’s a personal challenge.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to elevate the artist named in your edition. Here is how it works.  Collect an edition and watch your new piece of art build.  Open it in live mode and press R.  The name of an artist will appear.  This the artist you are asked to elevate.  The artist names are from the two lists found on fxfeed.xyz: “women in genart” & “lgbtqia2s+ in genart” (see full list below).  The names themselves are fx(hash) user names, facilitating easy location of their work.\n\nHow do you elevate? Here are some ideas:\n. Explore the artist’s work, commit their name to memory, and watch for opportunities to support them\n. Follow the artist on fxfeed and social media\n. Post about and engage in discussions about the artist’s work on social media\n. Take every opportunity to ask that the artist be included in events, panel discussions, podcasts, curated exhibits, newsletters, etc.\n. Collect the artist’s work if you have the means\n. List the work you’ve collected and help build the secondary market for the artist\n. Explore fx(elevate) editions collected by others, commit the names of those artists to memory, elevate them, repeat.\n\nIf we draw attention to, and train our influence on, these important members of the fx(family), we will be the change!\n\nThe other major feature of the work is the palette.  There are twelve choices, exposed as a feature, and each one is associated with an aspirational characteristic of our community.  You can take up the challenge of emphasizing this characteristic in yet another way of elevating our shared goal.\n\nThis work could not have been completed without the support of the fx team and two wonderful members of our fx(hash) community, cari ann shim sham* and louis. My undying love and respect always. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in April, 2023.\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [R] in live mode to reveal the name of an artist to elevate.\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution file suitable for printing. It can take a bit - please be patient.\n\nArtists:\n0rfula, Ada Ada Ada, Aeon Bloom, Aleksandra, AliaK, Ally, Alyssa Joines, Amanda Homem, Amber Vittoria, Amelia, Amy Goodchild, Ana Maria Caballero, Anna Lucia, Anna Carreras, aster1ai, Atelie 407.genart, aether, auniseiva, AutoEclectus, AydaEtb, Babara Ramos, Bandana, candevicmo, cari ann shim sham*, Casekimba, Cathy Burghi, catnips, Ce Vignolo, ChistAi, Ciput_GENART, crystalspaceshp, danielleking.tez, daratan, DehiscenceArt, DesignwithSarah, Devi Parikh, Dora Vlady, drawsbymv, Eliza SJ, ella, Elout de Kok, elsif, Emily Xie, Empress Trash, Estelle Flores, ExperiMentalnoise, Fabi Yamada, Faze, flight404, goldcat, Gyo, Henames.art, INA VARE, innadakota, IskraVelitchkova, Iteration__, Ivona Tau, jeres, jesshewitt, Jimena Buena Vida, Jojo Sunshine, Jolie Michel, jsliang, Julia V, krolcm, Kunio Okuizumi, Kusamehewa, la.agust, LadyTezos, levoontin.tez, Liam Egan, liasomething, linxirwengi, Lisa Orth, Lisa Sekaida, m5alien, mandybrigwell, mare-mon, Mariana JU, Medusa Iro, Melissa Wiederrecht, Minever, MinooK, nx0, Nadieh, Natalie.J, Negarnaderifard, NftEconomist, Nicole Vella, orbitanaut, Pixantle, QianqianYe, RalenArc, reona396, Reva, Rezva, sapirco, Sarah Ridgley, Sasha Stiles, se.nao.maja, Selisse, senbaku, sharla, Sollevera, sonylemon.tez, speginel, Stefj, SuLuLab, TAN-TAN, thesarahshow, trp_chai, Tyche, UBERMORGEN, V5MT, Victoria Crux, VidaV, violetforest, vocesferales, Wanda Oliver, Willow Pines, WizArtOfTez, Yasmin Senzi, Ziggo511.",
