This series takes inspiration in manga and samourai movies, and are the direct descendents of my Codevember Walker and Titan series, featuring creative coding to give life and personality to \"Walkers\".\n\nEach Akuma is part of an imaginary world and walks endlessly in their own way: elegant for fews, terrifying for others, peaceful for somes.. \n\nTo re-enforced their personality and play with the concept of fx-hash I teamed-up with the musician & composer Faubourg to add a generative sound track, now each Akuma has his own track from around ~3200 possibilities and the solo-lead(10%) and solo-pad (1%) have their own visual universe, but I will not spoil you more ;)\n\n🎶Note : You need to click to play the music and make your akuma heart beating .\n\nClick once : Start the music and make your akuma heart beating \nDrag : Control the camera \nPinch / mouse-wheel : Zoom\nEnjoy!\n\nTw makio64\nFaubourg : https://linktr.ee/faubourg\n\nPS:The profit of this NFT will be shared with Faubourg",

            "description": "The output of MAGNETIK reminds me of what tornadoes do to our cities and buildings, yet I imagine the pieces that are about to break off and fly away to be made of metal foil and they do so because of a magnetic force that is pulling them away from where they belong…  This one is also a charity run :  \n- 20% of the primary sales will go directly to the Processing Foundation, \n\n- Remaining 80% will be donated to a group of individuals that raise money to buy computers for less fortunate architecture students in a university in the eastern part of Turkey. Please read the next paragraph for a detailed explanation\n\n- I will decide what to do with the secondary sales later if there will be any.\n\nAbout the majority (80%) of the donation : I decided that the donations should be done in a double-blind way, the donator does not know who they are donating to, and the receivers of the donation will not know from whom the donation is coming from, hence I will transfer the funds these individuals mentioned to act as a middle-step. I feel like this is a hard thing to provide a solid proof for, so I recommend if you have doubts and/or straight away do not trust me or this process, do not mint. I will only be able to provide proof of transfer of funds to a third-party. I trust the people I am sending the funds to, we have done this before (not to brag or anything) and I know that we are affecting younger people’s life in a good way. Also, I believe that the funds raised from this project alone will not be enough to buy one decent config. computer by itself, if it were so, I would have done it differently.  About MAGNETIK :  \nMAGNETIK plays on the idea of distorting and breaking grids by employing an illusion of fake 3D and tries to make the resulting composition look good with rhythm and color harmony.\n \n- 21 palettes,\n- 2 background modes : lights on / lights off,\n- 3 grid types,\n- plus some surprise features…\n\nI encourage you to try and see the variations before minting :)  2 of the grid types are based on https://gorillasun.de/blog/an-algorithm-for-irregular-grids by Ahmad Moussa ( https://twitter.com/gorillasu ) and used with his knowledge and kind permission.\n\ngradient formulas are based on https://twitter.com/takawo/status/1505876107492720651?s=20&t=S9aU_oNYyjBieBcEmvUV-g\nby Takawo Shunsuke ( https://twitter.com/takawo ) and used with his knowledge and kind permission.\n\nThank you all in advance and have a good day!\n\nDISCLAIMER : I am not a good coder, I have tried to fix my past mistakes from my earlier projects to make some room for new mistakes :) I am hoping that there isn’t any huge bugs or anything left so you can enjoy your mint! Please hit me up if you have any concerns after minting and we can discuss a solution.\n",

            "description": "“Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas”\nVirgil, from Georgica, 29 BCE\n\nThe miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics for the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. OBSCVRVM, meaning “darkness” in Latin, takes this profound insight from physicist Eugene Wigner and explores it through a series of code generated spatial compositions. This collection redefines basic concepts of distance and time, with elements in the scene seemingly evolving at different spatial and temporal scales. Its universe exists on the ambiguous boundary between the cosmic and subatomic, forgoing color in place of structure, articulated through a single light source and myriad of shadows it casts on the intricate lattice geometries.\n\nEvery token is a spatial composition consisting of a frame, a central lattice and a background, layered in space like theater scenography. Many frames are narrow and take a form of a portal, some take up the whole space in between, and some are missing altogether. Background features a star field with celestial objects like stars, planets, moons, eclipses and comets. The universe of OBSCVRVM is highly ordered, with lattice-like structures imprinted in star fields that span thousands of light years. You might find shattered lattices close to ancient celestial objects like meteor fields, novas, quasars and space-time raptures. In this universe time flows unevenly, and it might take eons for destructive forces to completely disintegrate the lattice and take it to its ultimate state – heath death. Lattices themselves are formed through iterative subdivision rules from basic Platonic primitives. Special types of derived primitives called stations also appear, their origin still a mystery. Occasionally, a central lattice is missing from the composition, leaving the portal to frame a seemingly empty region of space. With over 250 calls to a random function within the code, the number of spatial configurations this generative system can produce is astoundingly large, although the collection explores only a small subset of them. \n\nVirgil’s quote from the beginning translates to: “Fortunate them, who were able to know the causes of things”. We know little about the origin of these lattices, but through their intricate geometries, OBSCVRVM takes you on a journey to explore deep space and time and ponder over our own place in them.\n\nLLP 🖖\n\n__________\n\nOBSCVRVM collection is written in JavaScript using THREE.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry. Generation of lattices is done using our own, open-source mesh subdivision module, which includes a custom mesh class. \n\nKey controls:\n\na : jump light angle\nf : cycle light framerate\nt : cycle light tick\ni : info\ng : start / stop gif capture\nb : white / black background\n1 – 5 : image capture 1-5x resolution \n\nToken looks best in live mode and 100% browser zoom. Change pixel density by changing your browser's zoom level (50% zoom doubles the pixels etc.) Tested on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge), devices (desktop, mobile) and operating systems (Windows, iOS). For best viewing experience, we recommend Chrome on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration. Due to recursive nature of geometry generation, some tokens might take much more time to generate. Please make sure the token works on your device before minting.\n\nWe were greatly inspired by Jacek Markusiewicz’s “adrift”, lunarean's “Heat Death”, and Monotau’s “Cradle” collections on fxhash, both by their approach to code as well as aesthetic synthesis of elements of their work. They motivated us to leave our code open (unminified and unobfuscated), available on public repositories (GitHub), and well documented through writing and talks so they can serve as inspiration to others. We see our support for open generative tools as a mission every generative artist should partake in. \n\nCreated in 2022 by {protocell:labs}.

            "description": "The joys of childhood are too easily forgotten. Paper Planes is a generative art collection celebrating the joy and magic of origami: from the simplest materials spring delightful forms brimming with ingenuity.\n\nIn homage to the handicraft of paper folding, we developed a collection of four pens each with a unique hand-drawn feel: Ink, Pencil, Gel and Dip. They ensure each of our ten origami birds are sketched with subtle imperfections.\n\nMany of the birds are folded from patterned paper based on three traditional Japanese patterns: Seigaiha, Kōjitsunagi and Shippō. Other birds are crafted from block coloured paper which provides pop and contrast whilst sometimes birds match their background, accentuating the hand-drawn strokes that sketched them.\n\nA range of layouts bring each mint to life. Birds can flock and fly across the page. They can be confined to a regimented grid or they can escape and embrace the chaos of the currents. Contrasting frames and borders highlight different colours within each of the 15 handcrafted palettes.\n\nIf you're feeling mischievous you can press 'C' in live view to ruffle some feathers…\n\nhttps://www.phaust.art/paper-planes\n\n----------\n\nIn live view, press 'S' to save a high resolution download or add '&size=#' to the end of the URL to render at a custom height.\n\nOriginal artwork by Phaust.

            "description": "fx(mash) is my humble contribution to celebrating #fxhashturnsone\n\nThis series is based on a simple algorithm - lines of a random length are drawn on a square grid until the grid is full.\n\nI have added a variety of features based on some of my favorite fxhash projects and a few special guests.\n\nThis collection is intentionally diverse and disorderly, that's a nice way of saying I only had a short period of time following the release of Acequia. As a result, some of the outputs might be weird, messy, or even bordering on broken (if you get one of the latter please let me know and I'll reimburse you).\n\nDespite being a bit rough around the edges, I hope fx(mash) reflects some measure of my love for the fxhash community. If you're feeling kind, then perhaps it even harks back to the experimental early days :)\n\nThe last year has been an incredible journey, thank you for letting me be a part of our story so far.\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press [s] to save the current image\n- Press [g] to toggle grain\n- Press [h] for a high-res output\n\nBeta Controls (in live view, definitely not fully tested):\n\n- Press [p] to start/pause animation\n- Press [i] to slow down animation\n- Press [o] to speed up animation\n\nAll primary sales go to Savepakistan.\n\n\nAcknowledgements:\n\nfx(mash) uses Gorilla Sun's grain implementation, a big thanks to him and meezwhite for a great article that is well worth supporting https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/all-about-that-grain\n\nThank you to the artists who created the following collections.

            "description": "The preparations for the first mission began in 2142. It had become clear that mining petroleum on Earth would soon become financially unfeasible, so looking to other planets was the only logical choice. It took seventeen more years to perfect the technology so that the first colonists could reach Proxima b within the lifetime of one generation.\n\nAfter 45 years of travelling at almost one-tenth of the speed of light, they reached their new home. It was rich in petrochemicals but scarce in the nutrients necessary for long term human survival. After merely six generations, humanity was forced to travel once again in search of a new world. The four missions that parted from the Proxima system to colonise other possibly habitable planets in the galaxy sparked a new age of human civilisation that would never see itself united and thriving again.\n\nEventually, all the colonies became independent societies as their differing interests drove them apart. Each small civilisation chose its path, wandering the void of space alone. Over time, millions of kilometres apart, each colony developed its own culture and traditions. While their habits and customs changed, some things remained the same across all the societies, like how it became a certain tradition to convert the outer world years and days to Earth time and celebrate holidays according to the calendar of the old world.\n\nThe new nomads learned from the first pilgrims. They used the technology once optimised for oil extraction to traverse other worlds, searching for sustenance. Peculiar wandering nonspaces emerged from the involuntary degrowth of human civilisation.\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.
