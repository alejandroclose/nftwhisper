            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.

At every step, a copy of this seed is laid edge-to-edge adjacent to an existing shape, without causing any overlaps. This copy is colored based on the edge it shares with the existing shape. The process continues until the animation completes.\n\nNew shapes are placed closest to a moving target. In some mints, this target is slow moving, causing new shapes to expand radially from the seed. In other mints, this target races around, causing new shapes to chase it. \n\nEach of the 13 shapes forms different patterns under different circumstances. Not all patterns will be explored.\n\nControls:\n  - SPACE: Pause/unpause the animation.\n  - ENTER: Skip the animation.\n  - R: Restart the animation.\n\nURL Params:\n  - \"preview=1\": Skip the animation.\n  - \"flex=1\": Adapt the boundaries to the size of the window.\n  - “slow=1”: Draw only one shape per frame.\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "“The Birth” is the second episode of “The Restoration Scheme” Series. The work was based on Acropora intermedia. \n\nIt’s a day after the full moon when the corals spawn simultaneously.\n\n——\n\n“The Restoration Scheme” Series\nIt’s a virtual action extended from the coral restoration plan led by Delta Electronics Foundation from Taiwan, consisting of five generative corals. Each of them was based on five different species of coral as the theme.\nIf collectors mint virtual corals, Delta Electronics Foundation will drop coral seedlings collectively in the sea. \n\nThe project is powered by FAB DAO (Formosa Art Bank). The split will donate to the local organization from Taiwan dedicated to the coral restoration scheme.\n\n——\n\nAbout Delta \nClimate change is causing irreversible impacts. Coral reefs, known for their rich biodiversity and the capability to nourish a quarter of marine life, are at the forefront of the crisis. Also known as \"tropical rainforests\" in the sea, coral reefs have experienced five mass bleaching events in the past five years. Once global warming exceeds the 2˚C threshold, it's likely that 99% of coral reefs will die off worldwide.\n\nIn addition to launching a coral restoration initiative along the northeast coast of Taiwan, Delta Electronics Foundation collaborates with Asia University to host \"Earth Pulsing: Nurturing Life Exhibition\" and releases the first art NFT featuring coral restoration. Through these actions, we hope to evoke public awareness of ecological issues.

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms.

Franke, a pioneer of computer art, passed away on July 16, 2022 at the age of 95. CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE is an homage to Franke’s MONDRIAN software developed for the Texas Instruments TI 99/4 home computer in 1979, and it’s a fundraiser to digitize his archive:\n\n“Our goal is to raise 20,000 Euro so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. If we raise more money, it will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.” \n\nEach frame, a single “pixel” is added to the CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE image. When the software first loads, 100,000 frames are run in the background to start things off. Keep it running for hours or days to see it transform entirely — it’s an “infinite animation.”",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.
