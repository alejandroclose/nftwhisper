            "description": "\nThe \"Focal Point\" series showcases a unique combination of four square artworks arranged in the shape of a plus sign on a textured brown paper. The central motif present in each artwork is an anchor, which also serves as the basis for the color palette throughout the series. The artist began by digitally creating a precisionist central artwork which led to further creation of 28 total artworks, divided into four sets, each set representing a direction.\n\nThe symmetry of the resulting form is striking, with the four squares perfectly aligning to create a cohesive and balanced composition. The use of textured brown paper as the background adds depth and dimension to the series, creating an interesting contrast with the clean lines and geometric shapes of the artworks.\n\nThe series is an exploration of unity and balance, using the plus sign, a symbol of addition, congruence and equilibrium, to visually represent the idea that by bringing different elements together, a new and harmonious whole can be formed. \n\nThe artist's intent is to convey that despite our differences in physical and intellectual attributes, we are all the same at our core. \n\n20% of the proceeds from this project will be donated to Southern Exposure, an artist-centered non-profit organization committed to supporting visual artists, that has been in the San Francisco Bay Area since 1974.\n\nFor more information regarding my past and upcoming projects, please visit meditationsincolor.com.\n",

I listened, and in the noise of the leaves and seeds in the wind, I truly recognized their languages and voices. I was so overwhelmed by the depth and diversity of the world and the creatures that inhabit it, that it is still one of my most vivid memories. \n\nWhen I walk through parks or forests, I always listen to what they say. It is unlikely that I will ever be able to engage in their dialogue, but it is always like a touch of the magical immensity of life.\n\nWild Palms is the name of a gallery of our friends with whom it is always a pleasure to talk in the language of humans, and they have a garden right in the gallery.\nIn the project we mix childhood memories and friendship, the aesthetics of woodcuts, Polaroid and hand-printed photos with echoes of the digital voice of our present.\n\nThanks to YulikolaY for getting the code ready for production.\n\nMade with love, AI and p5.js code\n\nJanuary, 2023",

            "description": "\"Echoes of Enough\" is a collection that explores self-worth, acceptance, and validation. The collection presents a visual representation of the struggles, doubts, and triumphs of recognizing our own value. Each piece delves into different aspects of ourselves and how they contribute to this feeling.\n\nThe seemingly chaotic yet orderly arrangement of the shapes in this collection reflects the tumultuous nature of the human experience. It speaks to the push and pull of self-doubt and the struggle to acknowledge one's own worth, while the raw and unrefined nature of the collection reflects the brutal reality of the human experience.\n\nA hidden harmony beneath the surface represents the truth that we are all enough, just as we are. The collection invites the viewer to look within and acknowledge their own struggles and triumphs and to find comfort in the realization that the feeling of being enough is always present, like an echo that lingers. \n\nIt is a reminder that we are enough, just as we are.\n\n\n\nThe artwork is fully created in javascript with the p5js library. \nThe ideal viewing resolution is 1000x1000, and the artwork can be scaled to any size/resolution. The grain effect will fade slightly for higher resolutions. \n",

In this edition we explore the 3rd, 4th and 5th powers.\n\nThe token is interactive, use your mouse-wheel to zoom-in and see all the little details. You will find a menu in the lower-right corner which allows you to play with the iterations and camera position. You can also render high-resolution images here.\n\nA little bit of magic happens when you select low iteration values, perhaps your token will even default to this.\n\nTechnical:\n\nNot all browsers support multi-threaded modules, the fallback mode is quite slow. Try Chrome if your browser is not supported.\n\nCalculated in full 64-bit on the CPU (not the GPU) for more accurate and detailed images.",

You will find a menu in the lower-right corner which allows you to play with the iterations and camera position. You can also render high-resolution images here.\n\nA little bit of magic happens when you select low iteration values, perhaps your token will even default to this.\n\nTechnical:\n\nNot all browsers support multi-threaded modules, the fallback mode is quite slow. Try Chrome if your browser is not supported.\n\nCalculated in full 64-bit on the CPU (not the GPU) for more accurate and detailed images.",
