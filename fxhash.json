            "description": "There is a place in a remote village with only forest and huge meadows and hills around it. I used to spend a few days there in the summer. This year it has become my retreat for the whole summer. There is silence around and no persistent explosions from the bombing. I wanted to use this time to relax and reflect.\n\nWhen I began working on the project, I had no specific goals in my mind. I didn't set myself any tasks, didn't commit to any deadlines. Suddenly, I found something that reminded me of blooming meadows, it was in tune with my state at that moment. So I started to develop this theme. I did not aim to turn it into a realistic picture. The images were supposed to remain abstract, just to convey the general mood and impressions I was feeling.\n \nInitially, it was a story about summer meadows and grasses. But in the process, I had memories of impressions that arose in different seasons, which I observed in nature here. Colour became the main conductor of the story about various states of nature. It is common to see a lot of black soil in spring through which fresh shoots break through, creating bright splashes on a dark background. During the early summer, the area is covered in lush grasses and wildflowers, as well as butterflies. The world blooms and life is reborn. Eventually, the grasses wither due to the hot sun. Sun-burnt straw sheaves take on a special beauty and texture.  As autumn approaches, we turn to the terracotta range, which offers a variety of ripe mature flowers. Winter is all about graphics. During this period, I usually like to take black and white pictures. Every time, every state of nature has its own beauty. As well as every period of our life.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nPlease pay attention: for rendering the project you might need a rather powerful CPU.

The robot is like an extension of the artist’s arm, allowing him to create infinite iterations and variations.\n\nThe dots pattern and their density help create the illusion of shadows, gradients and brightness, a technique inherited from the pointillism movement, born in Belgium and France in the late 19th century.\n",

The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature.

Each outcome is also physically plottable with pens: A SVG file can be exported (right-click save) to plot the piece physically. The plots are designed to be executed in A4 format on either fountain pens (on white paper) or gel pens (Black / Blue).\n\nThanks to the utility token decoupling, you can get a physical version: the digital NFT is the recipe to a plottable art piece, owning it confers the right to plot or request a physical plot from @greweb (https://greweb.me/plots/nft). @greweb would use fountain pens but other plotting artists are free to achieve it with their own materials and ship to collectors – as long as NFT is owned at request time.\n\nMore details and Source code: https://github.com/gre/gre/tree/master/doodles/plottable-era-primitive\n\n@greweb – 2022 – tech: WebGL + Rust + WASM – CC BY-SA 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\n\nreserve is set to previous 2022 physical plot collectors.\n",

In architecture, I diversified forms inspired by textured stone Mayan pyramids and enriched the world of emotions with a wide color palette. While depicting nature, I paid attention to realism, but I also wanted it to have a slightly Fauvist style. Although the colors of nature are generally recognizable, atmospheric and seasonal conditions allow us to witness the entire spectrum of colors in nature. In my collections, I have emphasized the inclusion of animation and interactivity. In this artwork as well, I have worked on atmospheric phenomena to make it animated. Particularly, I find the unsettling feeling and the melancholic impact of simulating a storm fascinating, which is why I chose to incorporate it.\n\n*Start and stop animation: press ‘A’\n*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as png.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n*15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.",

            "description": " \"The artist's ego can be a double-edged sword, driving them to push boundaries and innovate, but also risking the distortion of their true artistic vision in the pursuit of recognition and fame.”\nRosalind Krauss\n\n In this collection, I aimed to create compositions by combining architecture and nature. In architecture, I diversified forms inspired by textured stone Mayan pyramids and enriched the world of emotions with a wide color palette. While depicting nature, I paid attention to realism, but I also wanted it to have a slightly Fauvist style. Although the colors of nature are generally recognizable, atmospheric and seasonal conditions allow us to witness the entire spectrum of colors in nature. In my collections, I have emphasized the inclusion of animation and interactivity. In this artwork as well, I have worked on atmospheric phenomena to make it animated. Particularly, I find the unsettling feeling and the melancholic impact of simulating a storm fascinating, which is why I chose to incorporate it.\n\n*Start and stop animation: press ‘A’\n*Save image: press 'S' to save the current image as png.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n*15 percent of the royalty will belong to the minters.",

The textures are transformed, and they take on entity, volume, and claim their own story.\n\nBut what is important is how every process with the artistic materiality takes us to unexpected places. To places that were not there yesterday, that were not there a moment ago.\n\n“Las cosas que ayer no estaban” is a way of talking about time, yesterday sometimes evokes nostalgia, but also memories. Yesterday there were things that are no longer there today, but leave room for new things, new sensations.\n\nThe evocation of memories of the senses is something that I am interested in as a trigger for each work. Also, the inclusion of time and how this affects and mutates those sensations.\n\n\nkeys:\n\n- Interactive:\n\n[p] -> loop like palimpsest. Draws over and over again.\n[a] -> pause drawing\n\n- Saving:\n\n[1,2,3] -> change pixel density. Or can be passed via URL ?pd=5 produce 6000x9000pix. Be aware of the file size in render.\n[s] -> download canvas capture.\n[double tap] -> download canvas capture on mobile",

            "description": "\"Junina\" is a tribute to the June popular festivities in Brazil, when the streets and house facades are decorated on many cities, mainly on the Northeast Region of the country. Small flags, paper balloons, and lamps are hung on public space creating a very special atmosphere and colorful landscapes. \n\nPlenty of forró (traditional music), bonfires, fireworks, typical food and drinks are part of these festivities that celebrate rural popular culture. The “Festas Juninas” (June festivities) have an important affective place in the imaginary of the Brazilian population. \n\n\"Junina\" continues the experimentations with code of my previous work \"Monotipia\". The challenge of creating graphic compositions with simple elements remains. Searching and trying to delve deeper into ways to play with the rhythm and subtleties of transparencies, colors, shapes and textures.\n\nThis project is also an homage to the painters who made the Brazilian June festivities as the theme of their works, especially Alfredo Volpi (1896-1988) and Alberto da Veiga Guignard (1896-1962), but also Anita Malfatti (1889-1964), Emiliano Di Cavalcanti (1897-1976), Heitor dos Prazeres (1898-1966), and many others.\n\n---\nFeatures:\n-> 8 palettes (rarest = grayscale)\n-> 9 compositions\n-> Elements: 6 geometric shapes OR mixed element compositions\n-> 5 canvas formats: \n-----> tall portrait (9:16)\n-----> portrait (2:3)\n-----> square (1:1)\n-----> landscape (3:2)\n-----> wide landscape (16:9) = rarest\n-> Border colors: \n-----> soft\n-----> dark\n-----> deep gray\n-----> soberest color from palette\n-----> random color from palette (rarest)\n\n* The names of the color palettes are words related to popular June festivals. The decision to use untranslated expressions was made because these words carry many poetic meanings in Portuguese. For example, \"cinza\" means \"gray\" but also \"ash\". A word that refers to both the color and to the residue that results from burning wood in bonfires.\n\n---\nTo save the image as a png file, type:\n[1] save at actual size \n[2] save with 2000px height\n[3] save with 3000px height\n[4] save with 4000px height\n[5] save with 5000px height\n\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n---\nCreated with p5.js\n\n---\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2023\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada",
