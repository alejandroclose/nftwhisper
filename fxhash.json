Each edition shifts from the minter's chosen photograph after 10 seconds into pure ASCII noise, eventually devolving into chaotic Markov fragments.\n\n60% of mint and royalty proceeds will be donated to benefit victims of the recent Los Angeles fires.\n\nhttps://howl.camera",

            "description": "CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG is an homage to Ohne Titel (1969–1970) by Verena Loewensberg.\n\n2 of 5 in CENTURY-XXX, Series 2\nEdition of 128\n\nCENTURY-XXX is a series of software sketches that pay tribute to artists of the 20th century. Each piece is named after a specific artist and reimagines one of their original works through code, often by adding motion, variation, or interactive elements. These sketches don’t replicate the original artworks but instead extend their core ideas into new forms.\n\nBy “software sketch,” I mean something more informal than a finished artwork. While some of my projects take months or even years to complete, these sketches are created quickly—often in just a few days. They may be lighter in process, but they’re equally important to me. Sketching with code is how I think through ideas and discover new directions for future work.\n\nThe project began with the CENTURY exhibition at DAM Projects in Berlin in fall 2012, where I premiered Network C, Network D, and the first Signal to Noise software piece. Since then, these sketches have inspired more full-scale artworks like METASOTO, METAVASARELY, METAMOLNAR (also known as Hommage à Molnar), including the eponymous CENTURY released through Art Blocks in June 2021.\n\nCENTURY-XXX Series 1 was released from December 2021 to January 2022 in editions of 1,000. The first artwork in Series 2 followed in October 2022, also in an edition of 1,000. The remaining four works in Series 2 are scheduled for release starting in 2025, each in smaller editions of fewer than 128 based on what feels appropriate for the individual piece.\n\nThe long-term vision for CENTURY-XXX is to create 100 software sketches, each one inspired by a different artist and artwork from the 20th century.\n\nSERIES 1\n1.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMETAMALEVICH\n1.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMOLNAR(S)\n1.3 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMORELLET\n1.4 — CENTURY-XXX-METARILEY\n1.5 — CENTURY-XXX-METAKELLY\n\nSERIES 2\n2.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE\n2.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG\n\nMore CENTURY-XXX’s to come…",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

Somewhere in between is some yet-to-be-determined point at which beautiful unexpected forms emerge.\n\nThis system takes the standard model of equal exchange and throws it off balance, so each reaction will randomly decide which side has an advantage over the other, and instead of dispersal, one force will win out.\n\nIn this system, do similar complex patterns appear? Will we see anything new that doesn't appear with our usual rules?\n\nI found this idea very interesting, that even with no law towards chaos, actually the opposite, we can still end in formlessness. A blank end where no pixel differs from another.\n\nI think that through observation of the world and experimenting with its concepts, we can learn far more about life than just the processes we're studying. \n\nI'd be very curious to hear about what you take away from the work, and where your somewhere might be <3\n\nPress the space bar to add another step toward chaos\nPress ‘p’ to add 10 steps (enters mode 2)\nPress ‘f’ to enter an animation that will run for 1,056,993,066,125,486,216,810,417,723,659,732,792 years\nPress 'f' again to pause\nPress ‘a’ to add a new section of order to the system, you can use this when one state has taken over the canvas\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png\nPress ‘1’ or ‘2’ to begin render between the default 3200x4000px or 6400x8000px\n\nCreated by Chris McCully using p5.js, chroma.js, and GLSL.\n\nBuilt to run best on Chrome and Chromium based browsers.",

            "description": "Does entropy across time look the same in a universe different to ours? \n\nThe universe is full of potential energy, recognized as a difference across some scale. Differences in pressure, temperature, state, all act in pursuit of equilibrium. Given enough time, a closed system will eventually fall into an even dispersal. Somewhere in between is some yet-to-be-determined point at which beautiful unexpected forms emerge.\n\nThis system takes the standard model of equal exchange and throws it off balance, so each reaction will randomly decide which side has an advantage over the other, and instead of dispersal, one force will win out.\n\nIn this system, do similar complex patterns appear? Will we see anything new that doesn't appear with our usual rules?\n\nI found this idea very interesting, that even with no law towards chaos, actually the opposite, we can still end in formlessness. A blank end where no pixel differs from another.\n\nI think that through observation of the world and experimenting with its concepts, we can learn far more about life than just the processes we're studying. \n\nI'd be very curious to hear about what you take away from the work, and where your somewhere might be <3\n\nPress the space bar to add another step toward chaos\nPress ‘p’ to add 10 steps (enters mode 2)\nPress ‘f’ to enter an animation that will run for 1,056,993,066,125,486,216,810,417,723,659,732,792 years\nPress 'f' again to pause\nPress ‘a’ to add a new section of order to the system, you can use this when one state has taken over the canvas\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png\nPress ‘1’ or ‘2’ to begin render between the default 3200x4000px or 6400x8000px\n\nCreated by Chris McCully using p5.js, chroma.js, and GLSL.\n\nBuilt to run best on Chrome and Chromium based browsers.",

I wanted to bring those ideas together and create a feeling of comfort with this piece.\n\nThis generative token produces a random planet from a variety of types. Some are inspired by real planets, others by planets from fiction. Each planet can have moons or other nearby planets in the background. If the planet has its axis tilted it will have a summer and winter side, visible in its biomes. Very hot planets may have oceans only near the poles if at all, very cold planets may be frozen everywhere but the equator. \n\nPress down on the keyboard to see a map view in equirectangular projection.\n\nAnd most of all enjoy your very own planet!",
