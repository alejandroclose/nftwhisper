            "description": "Many people today may find wonder what exactly is happening to us as we orbit and move around our planet. Some might assume that there’s not much in the way of a reason, others might assume that humans are just being lulled into complacency by having their every need met and be self-absorbed in technology. Or maybe those assumptions are wrong, but for those who know about something called Chaos Theory, it is possible - at least in theory - that we are living in the very beginning moments of a process of change which will pop up from nowhere to take over everything as time goes on.\n\nSome would call it a surprise, but I don’t think a surprise is the right word. In fact, I think that it’s closer to bad luck than anything else. Those of us who know about Chaos Theory know that it’s even possible for a small change at the beginning of the universe to result in the formation of vastly different universes and some where we humans don’t even exist.\n\nNow, this is not something like one person acting differently or changes in other people around that one person. It’s not the butterfly effect. It’s more like there were two people and it was 50-50 to either one of them doing something and then, suddenly, one of those people wasn’t there. How would the other person react? Would they take away a piece of food, or maybe that person wouldn’t have said a particular word at a particular time? In either case, even if it was a tiny tiny difference - I mean, who knows what someone did in the past to make this happen - there would be no way for us to know now that that tiny change decided what kind of universe we live in now and what our lives will be like tomorrow.\n\nHow would you feel? Would you think it was bad luck or good luck, or something else? Chances are, you’re going to feel the same way. And don’t think I don’t know what you are thinking of doing if the world was to end and there’d be nobody around but you.\n\nOf course there are people who may have thought about doing something when they came across this article. Maybe people will assume that I am crazy for making these claims - which is fine as long as people assume that I am crazy in general. When things like this happen to us all at once, it is really hard for us to make sense of it all.",

Each subset of a multiverse has its own unique laws of physics, a set of rules, and its own distinct features.\n\nTangentum creates a projection of a random multiverse subset to a 2-dimensional plane. Each variation is a unique representation of the force field, that exists somewhere at some point in time.\n\nThis work starts a series of my visual exploration of functions, continuity, and boundedness, and I would love to share it with you.\n\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.\n\nTested with Chrome 107, Safari, and Firefox.

            "description": "An important element of generative art is emergence. The most famous algorithm for this is probably Cellular Automata (CA).\n\nHowever, numerous generative artists have created works using CA, which has lost its visual freshness and is like chewing gum that has lost its taste.\n\nAlthough it is such a classic algorithm, adding my own little ideas to it and finding a new \"flavor\" is the reason why I code.\n\nHere, the subject is 1D Elementary Cellular Automata, the simplest of all cellular automata. 1D Elementary Cellular Automata has 256 different rules, which change the shapes produced. This work aims to create more complex shapes by randomly selecting some of those rules and placing multiple of them on the screen.\n\nThe on/off of the CA cell is often likened to the behavior of living creatures.As of 2022, in the country where I live, prices are rising, wages are not increasing, and COVID-19 has not yet ended. I created this work with the image of people at the mercy of these various rules.\n\n---\n\nScreen click: Change rules\nS key: Save png\nL key: Show/hide grid",

The most famous algorithm for this is probably Cellular Automata (CA).\n\nHowever, numerous generative artists have created works using CA, which has lost its visual freshness and is like chewing gum that has lost its taste.\n\nAlthough it is such a classic algorithm, adding my own little ideas to it and finding a new \"flavor\" is the reason why I code.\n\nHere, the subject is 1D Elementary Cellular Automata, the simplest of all cellular automata. 1D Elementary Cellular Automata has 256 different rules, which change the shapes produced. This work aims to create more complex shapes by randomly selecting some of those rules and placing multiple of them on the screen.\n\nThe on/off of the CA cell is often likened to the behavior of living creatures.As of 2022, in the country where I live, prices are rising, wages are not increasing, and COVID-19 has not yet ended. I created this work with the image of people at the mercy of these various rules.\n\n---\n\nScreen click: Change rules\nS key: Save png\nL key: Show/hide grid",

            "description": "An important element of generative art is emergence. The most famous algorithm for this is probably Cellular Automata (CA).\n\nHowever, numerous generative artists have created works using CA, which has lost its visual freshness and is like chewing gum that has lost its taste.\n\nAlthough it is such a classic algorithm, adding my own little ideas to it and finding a new \"flavor\" is the reason why I code.\n\nHere, the subject is 1D Elementary Cellular Automata, the simplest of all cellular automata. 1D Elementary Cellular Automata has 256 different rules, which change the shapes produced. This work aims to create more complex shapes by randomly selecting some of those rules and placing multiple of them on the screen.\n\nThe on/off of the CA cell is often likened to the behavior of living creatures.As of 2022, in the country where I live, prices are rising, wages are not increasing, and COVID-19 has not yet ended. I created this work with the image of people at the mercy of these various rules.\n\n---\n\nScreen click: Change rules\nS key: Save png\nL key: Show/hide grid",

The artwork is derived from an initial sketch of Bwople which, despite being not the one that was chosen, still managed to captivate interests. The project provides a unique glimpse into an alternate universe in which Bwople could have been represented.\n\nAll images are hand-drawn work by Gengoya and composed by Vector Recite using PureSpider's fxhash-pfp maker tool.\n\nTo download the full size image on fx(hash):\n- Click \"open\" below the image\n- Left click on the image, a \"Download image\" button will appear on the bottom right.\n- Click the \"Download image\" button.",
