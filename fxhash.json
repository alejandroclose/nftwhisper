The project aims to take aesthetic concepts from sci fi graphic novels and blend them with generative systems of abstraction. \n\nThe debate is between using previously established art forms to influence this new medium, or using a new medium to meticulously reproduce a previous medium. I believe there’s room to explore the full spectrum, and I am attempting to find the midpoint that fits my work and brings me the most happiness.\n\nThe title describes the eventual aesthetic objective, which is to create a piece which might look like a splash page a colorist alone has been given the freedom to design and explore their own specialty. It explores centralized polar compositions, vibrant colors, plus lots and lots of movement. 60# paper is a standard weight for printing of comic books and graphic novels.\n\nPress ’s’ in live view to save a .png\n\nCreated with p5.js and chroma.js\n",

            "description": "\"MOUNTAINS\" is a work that belongs to the \"FLUX Series\", which utilizes the same techniques and processes as the previous work \"FLUX\". The shape in this piece is created by placing elements using noise and then performing recursive pixel operations on these elements.\n\nThe inspiration behind this work came from my continued sketches and studies of Flow Field, which led me to discover an expression of objects that seemed to be corroding. I believed that by applying this technique, I could create a realistic and vivid sculpture from a geometric shape.In this work, this corrosion treatment is applied to a geometric triangular shape of overlapping rectangles to form a realistic and dynamic mountain landscape.\nIt was as if geometric figures like Plato's \"ideas\" were materialized in the real world.\n\nAdditionally,  I was also inspired by the mountain views from my hometown at New Year's and by the manga background paintings of Yoshiharu Tsuge, who specializes in depicting villages with old hot springs.\n\nIt is possible to get a 5760 x 3240 px png file by right click save.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries.\n\nArtwork by hasaqui, @hasaqui.\nMade with p5js\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n",

As natural as a digital gift can be. It is a gen art token of my gratitude you might say. It is the younger sibling of \"The Spectrum of Nature\". \n\nThis is a gift from me to you, a gift of nature that pulls you through. \n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nTo know more about the concept and technicalities of this piece, see the fxtext article “The spectrum of nature - a short making of”. However, feel free to skip the article.\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nBasic info:\nThe initial render will be 1000px wide and 1000px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x2000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x9000 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

            "description": "*\\_../*`¬-’\\/*`¬’’¬`*\\/’-¬`*\\.._/*\n\nNature, nature, evolving might… Silent inventor, always right.\nWhere is the edge of nature and where do we begin?  \nWhat is of nature and what is of man? \nIsn't everything made by nature's hands?\n\nTo know more about the concept and technicalities of this piece, see the fxtext article “The spectrum of nature - a short making of”. Link at the bottom. If you’d rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

They work together to make the shapes emerge without revealing them completely and create dark and light areas that compose a feeling of depth and weight to the scene.\n\nSome pieces are chaotic, some more ordered. Some have strong compositions, some don't. By zooming in on the details we can let our mind wander and start seeing shapes.\n\nBest experienced in full-screen.\n\nPress S to take a screenshot\nPress M to take a high resolution screenshot\nPress H to take a higher resolution screenshot (may not work for some devices)\n\nWARNING: Project is using webgl, it may not work on some older devices.\n\nOriginal artwork by William Watkins · Lyon, 2022",

Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.\n\nWhile many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.\n\nBut there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.\n\nI can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.\n\nWhat happens when a flower has more petals than pixels?

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.\n\nWhile many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.\n\nBut there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.\n\nI can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.\n\nWhat happens when a flower has more petals than pixels? Why do we know there's more layers to that thumbnail?\nMy best answer is:\n\n--Press \"s\" key to save a bigger image (2400x3200 px)\n",

            "description": "Monad 1960 is a collection of generative artworks created using JavaScript code, inspired by the generative art movement that emerged in the 1960s. Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of basic modules, or 'monads', that are combined and transformed through an algorithmic process to generate a unique generative artwork.\n\nIn philosophy, the term 'monad' was used by the German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz to describe the basic and indivisible unit of reality. In generative art, the term 'monad' refers to the simple elements that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create artworks.\n\nPioneers of generative art, such as Vera Molnar, Michael Noll, and John Whitney, experimented with the use of algorithms to generate artworks. These artists developed computer programs and mechanical systems that used simple patterns and shapes to create complex and dynamic artworks. In this context, 'monads' became the fundamental building blocks of these generative artworks.\n\nIn the Monad 1960 collection, programming and algorithmic design are used to generate unique artworks that reflect the principles of the generative art movement. Each artwork in the collection is composed of a series of 'monads' that are combined and transformed through algorithmic processes to create a unique generative artwork, exploring the relationship between the simplicity of the 'monads' and the complexity of the resulting generative artworks.\n\nFeatures:\n8 background colors.\n8 canvas sizes.\n45 types of number groups that create different paths for the algorithm.\n\nThe animation lasts 30 seconds, so I recommend waiting until it finishes before downloading the artwork.\nPress \"S\" to download the image.\n\nCreated by Fernando Cabral.",
