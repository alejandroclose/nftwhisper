            "description": "Exactly one year ago I was minting my first fxhash project. \n“Posizioni” was a quick sketch of only 25 editions that I put together to test this new platform and to my great surprise, it was the start of an amazing journey in this space that still continues to amaze me every day. \n\n“RE/Posizioni” is an ideal continuation of my personal path that started one year ago: I decided to create an animated, glitchy, or even broken piece, something completely different from what I usually do as an artist and as a coder (and probably something I’m not very good at, forgive me for this :D ).\nEven if this NFT crazy world is often uncertain, insecure, or unstable, we need to find a balance no matter how difficult, just as the lines in this artwork try to do.\n\nGoing out of my comfort zone, experimenting, or just having fun is what keeps this creative practice enjoyable for me, and it’s all that matters.\n\n----\n\n- Mouse click to pause the animation\n- \"s\" key to download a png\n- \"f\" key to full screen\n\nTested on Desktop/Chrome.\nSee LICENSE.md for more licensing details.\n",

            "description": "\"Temporal Black\" is a free (giveaway) collection for the holders of initial \"Temporal\" drop https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/22849\n\nA gift for the change of year.\n\n\n\"Temporal Black\" is a generative (pure code) artwork of abstract colored geometric shapes and forms, mixed in a way that trying to simulate natural media\n\nTechnically, colored shapes and curves are drawn in a graphic buffer and my custom fragment shader process and transforms the buffer content into that noisy and scratched output. All are 100% code, no images used.\n\n\nCONTROLS\n\nKEYS:\n\n- 1-4: Set resolution from 1x to 4x of the current dimension (possibly slower performance in higher values)\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait with aspect ratio 0.75 (useful eg. for printing)\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape with ratio 4/3  (1.333..)\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ when switching orientations\n\n----\nMade with p5js and custom shaders\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\nWant to know more ? please read the \"SHORT BIO\" section here in \"Emotions\" collection: https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/22243\n\n© Jan. 2023  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",
