            "description": "Organic Illusion is one of the very first computer graphic drawings I produced that I considered worthy of being called Art. This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory. Like a child you never forget. I submit to you again in new media for you all to enjoy.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds. You can find more information at https://cure3.co.uk/.\n\n-----------------\nControls\n- R: new randomized output (the chances of recovering one of these outputs are very slim, that's what the next control is for)\n- E: high-res output\n- Double click: fullscreen\n\nWhile you see the eye of Horus, your artwork is loading.\n\n------------------\nMade with p5.js & glsl\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0",

            "description": "Strands of memory are twisted and entangled with each other, blending in and out with the surrounding fog of chaos. Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

            "description": "The story behind this collection is that there isn't really a story behind this collection. It is the result of play, tinkering, and curiosity.\n\nOne of the beautiful things about generative art is how we can achieve drastically different results simply by modifying a few parameters or lines of code. As my first release here on fxhash was 'Sabler', it felt fitting that my release for #fxhashturnsone would itself be a modified version of that 'Sabler' algorithm, albeit giving drastically different results.\n\nIt is notable for the fact that this is perhaps my most 'chaotic' collection yet, letting go of carefully considered proportions, angles and positioning and here leaving that in the hands of the computer. In a way, this simple act represents several design decisions I never would have imagined myself making a year ago, highlighting my growth as a generative artist over the past year.\n\nIt is also a reflection of the inspiration gained from many of the artists and boundary-pushers in the space that each time unlock and encourage creations beyond the immediate comfort zone. For that, this is a 'Thank You' to all of you.\n\nWith that, here's to many more years of generative beauty and inspiration on fxhash and beyond.\n\nAs with previous collections, I highly recommend viewing the images at full size and savouring the details and the chaos up close. Pressing 'S' will save a 6000 x 6000 px PNG file.\n\n50% of primary sales will be donated to the Processing Foundation.",

            "description": "ecologías - B\n\nwater is the medium where life first appeared in our planet. Water is also indispensable for the continuation of the life that emerged from - and with - it. The advent of AI species and their introduction into society is a new form of cambrian explosion. What is their medium? What is their water? How scarce and precious will it be for them? AI entities are not foreign to human resource necessities, though. The water that is essential to our human life will also be so for machines, as their energy still depends on our natural resources. Therefore, the ecologies of humans and machines will have, at least, the same elements as the ecologies of humans. AIs may help us reach better balances, only if we employ them to do so and if we teach them to help us.\n\necologías-B is an entity that is part of a broader ecology. Released on occasion of the show \"Unbound - Ecology in the Age of Machines\" at Unit London. The data generated by this entity is read by a different piece minted on Ethereum, creating a link between Tezos and Ethereum, a metaphor for an ecology of blockchains.\n\nit shares a common element with two other works released on fxhash: ecologías A and ecologías C, all of them contributing data to aforementioned pieces.\n\nread more at https://www.iillucid.com/ecologias\n\n15% of primary sales are donated to institutions working towards improving biodiversity and environmental efforts.\n\nMarcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro\nCC BY-NC-SA 4.0, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\n\nBuilt on p5.js and p5.Framebuffer (massive thanks and respect to the corresponding authors)\n\nappend &pd=N (N a number) to the URL in live view to increase/decrease resolution\npress s to save current image in current resolution\npress z,x,g,b,n followed by +/- to increase/decrease, respectively, brightness, contrast, gamma, blur, noise\npress l (as in loop) to pause/resume the piece",
