            "description": "Midfile Crisis is about realizing halfway through you are not gonna make it.\n\nThe struggle is real.\n\n-\n\nThe work itself is the union of 2 projects, which, well, didn’t make it. Together though, they are stronger than ever. So yes, Midfile Crisis is a love story, too.\n\n-\n\nProcedural , ever changing real-time animation, October 2022\nJavascript and WebGL\n\n-\n\nFEATURES\n\n- 6 color palettes, inspired by recent artworks by Xenia Hausner, Ayako Rokkaku, Jenny Saville, Amy Sherald, Sue Williams and Emily Xie, are referenced accordingly. One additional, rare color palette will slowly cycle through the full color spectrum.\n- Direction: Up, Right, Up Right\n- Seed: Up, Right, Up Left\n- Shape Tendency: Tetra, Box, Sphere, Octa, Ico, Multi\n- Amount: Low, Medium, High\n\nVIEWING\n\n- The artwork is in landscape format, please click on open to see the full frame and resolution. We recommend rotating your screen on mobile.\n- Press 'i' to show artwork title and features.\n- Press 's' to save an image.\n- To guarantee the same output at different resolutions the simulation driving the artwork is locked at 1024x512 pixels. To unlock, press 'u' - this can help when running at a lower resolution and the animation is not smooth, or when running at significanly higher resolutions and pixelation is starting to occur. Please note this will break the deterministic nature of the work.\n- Best viewed in Chrome Desktop with dedicated GPU.\n- Please note: requires latest devices (supporting WebGL2) for a smooth experience.\n",

            "description": "\"◉◉◉\" presents a collection of pointillistic drawings generated by p5js. However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.\n\"◉◉◉\" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.\n\nThe technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

            "description": "\"◉◉◉\" presents a collection of pointillistic drawings generated by p5js. However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.\n\"◉◉◉\" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.\n\nThe technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

            "description": "'Murals' is a collection of 256 abstract compositions born out of an intense period diving deeply into street art, pointillism and the inner workings of neural networks.\n\nThe work explores projection, refraction and abstraction of points as they ripple through multi-dimensional space-time. Points refract through multi-dimensional space to become shapes, which then become coordinate systems for the projections of new points that create a sense of form, texture, lighting, and material properties. \n\nThe work is also a celebration of imperfections and how a combination of many tiny – almost individually imperceptibly small – imperfect details can shape our perceptions of form, materiality, mood. This is explored within this work through subtle uses of sprays, flecks, scuffs, cuts, grain, targets (projections of projections), construction lines, base projections, occasional glitches that cause curvature, bounced light, shadows, and more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n15 colour palettes: \nScream, Night Bus, Double Backflip, Jaws, Sunday, Atom, Space, Tipex, \nGraphite, Leaf, Earth, Bubble Gum, Citrus, Jellyfish, Damp Concrete.\n\n4 times of day (that create subtle changes in light colour):\nDaylight, Winter Morning, Midnight, Sunset\n\n2 Border types: \nNormal, Thin\n\nVarious features that subtly impact appearance surface textures and shard forms:\nMetallic, Engrave, Number of Shards, Scuff Marks, Symmetry. \n\nControls:\n- Press [ S ] to save the work at its current image size as a PNG.\n- Press [ 1 ] to set the image size to 1440 x 1944 pixels (default size)\n- Press [ 2 ] to set the image size to 2880 x 3888 pixels\n- Press [ 3 ] to set the image size to 4320 x 5832 pixels\n\n- Press [ F ] to toggle freeform mode to create custom image sizes and aspect ratios\n- Press [ R ] to reload the image (for use in freeform mode)\n\nThis work has been tested on Chrome and Safari on Mac OS, and also using an Android smartphone. Please make sure that it works on your device before minting. Based on testing (in May 2022), each work should take about 5-10 seconds to fully load on a laptop or desktop machine, and 15-20 seconds on a mobile device. The loading process is animated so you can watch the construction the static artwork during this time. \n\nThis artwork is created with p5.js \n\n@nbswwit, 2022\n",

These ideas sometimes revolve around specific algorithmic concepts, with the aim to combine, remix and chain together methods in some novel way. In other instances these ideas are a vague vision of particular aesthetic that I'm trying to chase down. Usually though, it's a bit of a mix of both. Assemblage was conceived in this manner, evolving from the combination of several Genuary sketches.\n\nTo play into this narrative and further it a little bit, while searching for a suitable name for the project, I thought that the art in of itself, in some way, looked like a disassembled or shattered machine, with the constituent pieces scattered and strewn around in a chaotic manner. This is in contrast to fact that the items are actually positioned in a very orderly and systematic manner, where no two shapes can technically overlap or intersect, creating an interplay of Order and Chaos.\n\nPress S to download a PNG version of the artwork. 2400 x 3000 pixels.\nIt can take up to a couple of seconds to generate all of the graphics.",

            "description": "Dencity is a generative art project inspired by aerial views of cities with a high density of buildings. Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

            "description": "aprendizajes is a generative art project that pays a tribute to the process of learning. 25% of primary proceeds go to Save The Children. Full description of the artwork+instructions here: https://www.iillucid.com/aprendizajes/\n\nThe artwork allows the user to:\n\n* Change resolution: press 'd' followed by any number from 1 to 9 to add that amount to the pixel density. If you get a black screen you have surpassed what your graphics card can handle: press d + 0 to reset the pixel density. You can fine tune pressing d followed by + or - (+/- 0.5).\n* Save image: press 's' to save the current image as png. For a higher resolution png, 1st increase the resolution using 'd' and then save the image with 's'.\n* Tune image parameters: press 'z' (brightness), 'x' (contrast), 'g' (gamma), 'b' (blur) followed by + or - to adjust. Toggle tuning with 'a'. Press 'n' then + or - to adjust amount of noise.\n* Redraw: 'r' (changes how lines are drawn)\n\nIt is recommended to read the full instructions on the article.",
