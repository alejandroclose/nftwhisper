            "description": "An “algorhythmic” exploration of the oral/aural tradition in poetry. \n\n“Zero is a time of night.\nZero is the color of snow.\nZero is the space between notes.\nZero is the silence between words.\nZero is the pause before breath.\nZero is void in the heart of a crowd.\nZero is not nothing, but it’s not everything.\nOne is a time of day.\nOne is the color of spring grass in sunlight.\nOne is the warmth at the back of my neck when I turn to find you standing there.\nOne is the rhythm at the base of my spine.\nOne is the peace at the core of my being.\nOne is the sound of your voice in the dark.\nAnd one more thing:\nWithout one I am nothing…”\n–Technelegy \n \n\nFusing AI-powered verse, spoken word, original music and visuals all in generative composition, this playful ode to our universal language is inspired by Stiles’ binary-based art and Stern’s performative poetics. The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature. Brought into existence via the blockchain, it is a new form of “token word poetry.”\n\n\nAs with the duo’s other poetry “unreadings,” all minters will receive an airdropped broadside of the full poem after all editions are collected. A 1/1 media-rich version of the entire poem will also be made available. \n \nPoetic traits:\n- 321 editions performed by the algorithm, out of billions of possible combinations\n- Each unique piece contains between 3 and 6 (out of 60) lines of generative text from a poem by Technelegy – a custom text generator fine-tuned on Stiles’ writing and research material, seeded with prompts from Stiles’ and Stern’s work – translated into binary and performed by Stiles\n- 24 possible binary backbeats performed by Stern in his “Nathaniel Fun Time” (NFT) stylings, and generatively re-mixed\n- 98 possible intros\n- 15 musical stems composed by Kris Bones, generating millions of possible mixes\n- Thousands of possible ending combinations \n- 5 fonts, layered in billions of potential ways, including Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer”\n- 13 color palettes based on Stern and Stiles’ respective artworka\n- Very rare attributes including music-less performance, poem-less music, repeated “B1nary 0de” (title only)\n\nClick to start and stop or replay. Although the first play through will be the same every time, starting and stopping may create minor variations in your mix (though not any of the core attributes).\n\n0RAL B1NARY: “BINARY ODE” was produced with partial support from Refraction DAO’s Creative Grants program, and premiered as part of Refraction Festival at Art Basel Miami 2022. 15% of primary sales go to Refraction, and 5% of primary sales will be donated to Black Girls Code.\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Made with p5.js.\nThis work is animated.\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 1000 x 1000 resolution.

Each artist has 5 Artworks in this collection, which have been randomly combined with Borders that I designed (Morteza Yousefi, idea owner and art director)\n\nThis combination has got a beautiful effect in a random way, and besides that, it makes this collection very valuable because of the reputation and Ideas of the 20 artists.\n\nThe number of Traits in this collection is 5 (137 layers) and it has the ability to make 930,240 NFTs.\n\nTo create balance, these NFTs are randomly minted, and this is a chance for everyone to get a rare version. So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\n\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\n🟧🟦\n🟧🟧\n\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nMade in 2022\n\nDesigned by: \n@morteza_yousefy\n@ardavan_\n@happyfamily1985\n@Raze_Slb\n@Didoxme\n@mo0n_zi\n@mahdirezafathi\n@HrishNft\n@HeleDesignnft\n@SebastianVamp21\n@farahmand1989\n@Samaneh_syd\n@ma_khalaji\n@negar_khozhandi\n@lvcteam8\n@Elid_33\n@OmidMahdavi7\n@ehsan_special\n@OmidiNariman\n@ARTsnakeNFT\n\n",

            "description": "A virtual gallery displays sculptural forms that slowly get fractured into shards by falling coins.\n\nSummer, 2022 I had 2 (physical) art exhibitions in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Both exhibitions combined physical and digital work, including NFT's. During the exhibition period, I was struck by the spatial and temporal limitations of the physical galleries, not to mention the elitist economic model. This experience was in stark contrast to the very positive, even joyful, experience I've been having publishing NFT's, especially on fxHash.\n\n'Sharding' explores the creation and destruction of generative knot, and related, geometries. The facetted geometry is creating utilizing the following steps:\n1. curve creation\n2. form extrusion\n3. Verlet node creation\n4. facetted face creation\n\nThe different steps enable the forms to be disassembled/reassembled into their face primitives, including accurate (enough) collision response.\n\nInteractivity:\n\nMouse/Trackpad:\ndrag -> camera rotation\nMouse Rt Btn -> camera pan\nscroll wheel/pinch -> camera zoom\n\nKey Input:\nr: reassemble geometry\nw: toggle wireframe on/off\n-: reduce active coins\n+: increase active coins\np: screen capture\n\nNote:\nPlease post your favorite 'Sharding' screen captures\nTW: @iragreenberg\nIG: @greenberg.ira\n\nBuilt with three.js, PByte.js, TypeScript, Node\n\nThank you Paul Bourke, for some of the knot equations\n ",

Flaws, imperfection, signs of age and wear add character and give a sense of history.\n\nIt's true of pottery and it's true of many other things.\n\nKintsugi is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum. (Wikipedia)\n\nThis 100% generative system creates pottery designs inspired by the philosophy of Kintsugi. All the bowls are cracked and repaired with gold. Some have small engraved messages. Colors and bowl shapes are not necessarily based on traditional Japanese designs. Color and vessel shape vary greatly.\n\nFeatures:\nType - Square, Hexagonal, Octagonal, Decagonal, Round\nTilt - number (3-14)\nAssymetry - Left, None, Right\nRing Striping - true, false\nVertical Striping - true, false\nMessage - true, false\nLumpiness - None, Low, Medium, High\n",

And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\nBecause this is an NFT in PFP format, you can put it on your avatar on Twitter or Instagram.\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nDesigned by: @morteza_yousefy\nMade in 2022",
