In light of complicated and urgent challenges including climate change, social inequality, and political division, the entire society may need to \"whip into shape\" in order to address these problems and find answers. This calls for teamwork, perseverance, and a shared dedication to ideals like justice, sustainability, and compassion.\n\nWhipping into shape an organization or institution can refer to creating accountable and transparent processes of governance to make sure individuals in positions of authority behave in the best interests of their constituents. This calls for a readiness to address dishonesty and unethical behavior while placing an emphasis on openness and justice. We may make sure that the institutions that run our society serve the interests of everyone by \"whipping\" these institutions into shape.\n\nLastly (?), \"whipping into shape\" can be used to describe addressing damaging or outmoded cultural practices and ideals. A commitment to communal discipline and effort is required to advance issues such as racial justice, environmental sustainability, and gender equality. It involves affecting people's hearts and minds, pressing back against deeply rooted notions, and committing to a more just and equal society.\n\n-----Controls---------------------\nPress 'f': to change the background color to any other color in the palette.\nPress 'g': to change the background to white.\nPress 'h': to change the background to black.\nPress 'j': to change the background to default color.\nPress 'k': to change the background color to a gradient.\n\nPress 'o': to generate a flower.\nPress 'p': to return to normal.\nPress '[': to increase the transparency of the background (same effect as 'o' or 'p' but can be controlled).\nPress ']': to decrease the transparency of the background (same effect as 'o' or 'p' but can be controlled).\n\nPress 'q', 'w': to randomize the color.\n\nPress 'a': to decrease the size of the cursor to conceal (or potentially reveal) shapes. \nPress 'd': to increase the size of the cursor to conceal (or potentially reveal) shapes.\n\nPress 'z': to display hidden shapes under the cursor faintly.\nPress 'x': to display shapes outside the cursor's radius faintly.\nPress 'c': to hide shapes outside the cursor radius.\n\nPress 's': to save\nMouse click: to create something cool.\n----------------------------------",

            "description": "Kyma (/kee-ma/, κύμα) is a Greek word meaning wave. It is my exploration of an acoustic phenomenon known as ‘Chladni Patterns’. \n\nErnst Florens Friedrich Chladni was a German physicist and musician. He was a pioneer of modern acoustics and made numerous contributions to the field. Chladni's work had a significant influence on the development of modern music theory and the technology of musical instruments. In 1787, Chladni was trying to understand how sound waves propagate and interact with objects. By vibrating a metal plate and sprinkling sand on it, he observed that the sand arranged itself into distinct patterns. These patterns are created due to the interaction between the sound waves and the plate: the sound waves cause the plate to vibrate, which in turn causes the sand to move. The sand will move away from areas of high vibration and towards areas of low vibration. This creates a unique pattern of ridges, circles, and many other shapes.\n\nKyma continues this study by adding color, light, and composition to the equation. Each iteration is a unique combination of two Chladni plates with different characteristics, accompanied by a palette, background lighting, and variational drawing algorithm. Plates interact with each other, forming patterns from the small detailed net-like grid to megalithic sculptures of unknown creatures and windows to another worlds.\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.\n\nRendering can be computationally heavy, please be patient and give it some time to draw.\nChrome is highly recommended for live mode and high res saving.\n\nMade with love, math, and p5js. \n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG 2400 x 1600\n[2] - save PNG 4800 x 3200\n[3] - save PNG 9600 x 6400\n[4] - save PNG 14400 x 9600",

            "description": "Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project. \n\nFile Size: 5100 x 6600\nPress ’s’ to save the image as a .jpg\nPress ‘p’ to save the images as a .png\n\n//= Tiller, 2024\n",
