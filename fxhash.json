            "description": "Introducing the latest art project that will have you questioning your investment strategies - \"Meme Stonks Roulette\"!\n\nThis generative art project is an offering to the legend of WallStreetBets subreddit and their technical analysts who just yolo their way to glory. With \"Meme Stonks Roulette,\" you'll never know what you'll hit - much like the volatile stock market.\n\nUsing complex algorithms and the many technical analysis techniques often quoted but never used on WallStreetBets, each artwork randomly generates a one-year return on one of the meme stonks after “analyzing” last three-years’ data. Don’t believe us? Check out the animation, it's visual proof. But don't be fooled - this project is not any more or less accurate than the diamond-handed experts on the subreddit.\n\nWill you hit the jackpot and see a one-year return of 1,000% on GameStop? Or will you paper hand it and get a return of -99% on AMC? It's all up to chance and the whim of the algorithms. Our algorithms are so galaxy-brained that they can predict the next trend before it even becomes a meme. That's right, we can see the future - or at least pretend to.\n\nWith \"Meme Stonks Roulette,\" you can now join in on the meme-mentum and make your own arbitrary predictions by riding on pure luck and absurdity. Just spin the wheel and let destiny decide which stock you're going to ride. Who needs boring old financial analysis when you have a colorful, spinning wheel? And who knows, one day you might be the next meme stock millionaire - or perhaps you'll just end up with a bunch of worthless Dogecoin. Either way, it's a win-win. Just don't blame us if you end up broke and living in your parents' basement.\n\nBut hold your horses, there's more! We're not just here to make you question your investment choices - we're also giving away PRIZES.\n\nThat's right, the trader with the highest return on any meme stonk generated by \"Meme Stonks Roulette\" will be eligible for an airdrop on each of our next three projects. It's like winning the lotto, but with way less money and way more memes.\n\nBut we don't just reward success - we also reward failure. Twice! The two traders with the lowest returns on any stock will also be eligible for an airdrop on each of our next three projects. So even if you get rekt, you can still moon it to the moon.\n\nDisclaimer: \"Meme Stonks Roulette\" is obviously not an investment advice, unless you think reading tea leaves can predict the market better than the \"experts\".\n\nFollow us on twitter @mElon0Husk.\n\nThank you to Liam Egan, Margarine and hal09999 for your help on FXHash Discord with our first project!\n\nEntirely coded in p5js. Press s in fullscreen at the end of the animation to save the image. \n",

            "description": "A response to being buffeted by forces outside of our control. Platonics sought to find order, control and solace in the Platonic solids. Instead it found beauty and intrigue in the emergent chaos that can arise from even the simplest systems.\n\nIts building blocks are the five Platonic solids. Forms which have fascinated humanity for thousands of years. Their title comes from the philosophy of Plato, who equated each of the solids with a classical element.\n\nPlatonics arranges these forms in a series of geometric layouts, with varying density and randomness. At one extreme we see tidy radial circles consisting of a single solid. At the other, packed pentagons consisting of jumbled solids give rise to Escher-esque compositions which hold near infinite variety, variety enhanced by a range of pens and colours that draw and fill those solids.\n\nThis relationship between order and disorder is at the heart of Platonics. The collection seeks to show how they are not so far removed from one another – and how we might embrace them both. It also aims to give collectors a behind the scenes look at how generative compositions can be constructed.\n\nThe geometric proof that there are only five convex regular polyhedra (the Platonic solids) states that at each vertex of the solid the angles between adjacent sides must be less than 360 degrees. This amount less than 360 degrees is known as the defect angle.\n\nIt is from this geometric proof that the collection size and pricing for Platonics is derived. There will be 360 Platonics sold via a Dutch auction priced according to the defect angles of the five Platonic solids: 180 > 120 > 90 > 60 > 36.\n\nhttps://www.phaust.art/platonics\n\n----------\n\nCompetition: Submit your favourite previews via Twitter to win a free mint and print.\n\nPrints: Free gallery-grade, signed A3 prints for the first 18 mints.\n\nLive: Press ‘S’ to save in hi-res or append '&size=#' to the URL for custom height.\n\nInfo: Original artwork by Phaust.
