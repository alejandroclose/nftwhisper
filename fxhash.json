            "description": "Let me take you places. Those are not in your town, not even on your planet. They’re placed somewhere between reality and subconsciousness.\nEnormous, peculiar structures emerge upon you, refusing to be ignored. They are your unfulfilled cravings or ever-lurking demons. They were always there, under your skin, intangible, now they’ve materialized.\nYou may not like them, they may seem too vast, too scary to tame. But ultimately, you have to face them, unless you enjoy living in their shadow. \n\n___\nInspirations\n\nI’ve never truly realized that, but ever since I remember, the sight of gigantic objects or creatures evoked strong emotions within me.\nIt probably started with playing Shadow of Colossus (a video game) as a kid and seeing The Cathedral (short movie by Tomasz Bagiński). Years later, reading Solaris (by Stanisław Lem) aroused the same feeling (among others) of being mesmerized by the vastness. More recently, movies like Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival (which also nudged my attraction to mystery) and Dune - have charmed me.\n\nEarlier this year I have stumbled across Dawid Planeta (artist and yoga teacher) and began contemplating his visions of mini people in the jungle inhabited by giant animals. These works in particular, plus Hollow - generative series by Jacek Markusiewicz - were probably my final inspirations to make Intangible look the way it does.\n\nSettling semi-random generative structures in some kind of reality, gave them a meaning - they may symbolize things much bigger than you - the ones you try to escape from or those you’ve been longing to experience for years. I have mine, don’t you?\n\n___\nControls in live mode\n\n\nKeyboard\n[ space ] - toggle light animation\n[ S ] - save image with current size (default is 120% of browser window’s height; you may change browser’s scale or check URL size param)\n[ F ] - fullscreen \n[ up / down ] - light intensity\n[ left / right ] - base light position\n[ 1..5 ] - aspect ratio: 10:16 („zero” ratio), 1:1.4142 (vertical A4), 1:1, 1.4142 (horizontal A4), 16:10\n[ B ] - toggle border\n[ Z ] - toggle canvas „raw” mode - no shadow / margin (auto applied in fullscreen mode)\n[ N ] - toggle „that thing you may not want on print”\n\n\nURL params\nYou may add any number of parameters to the URL to start it with particular settings. \n[ animate ] (1/0) - toggle light animation\n[ size] (number) - number of px for longer edge, i.e. 4000\n[ ratio ] (number or ratio with format: 10/16, 10:16, 10_16) - aspect ratio\n[ light ] (number 40..120, some palettes have slightly different limits for good results) - light intensity\n[ lightShift] (number -100..100) - base light position\n[ border ] (1/0) - toggle border\n[ hddcy ] (0/1)\n\nExample: [ &size=4000&border=1&light=100&animate=1 ] \n\n\nMobile\n[hold 2 fingers for 2s] - save\n[double tap] - fullscreen\n\n\n___\nNote:\nI encourage you to do some light adjustments before you save an image for print. I’m pretty sure you can do better than fxrand().\n\n\n___\nSpecial thanks to my brother Krzycho, for lots of advices / heathy criticism and to Olga, for never-ending excitement and „dorady”.\n\n___\nDeveloped in Javascript, using p5.js (2D Canvas) and chroma.js.\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n© April-July 2022, MadeUpLifeforms (mulf)\n",

            "description": "GuilCity is the beginning of an exciting journey bringing Guillaume Cornet’s densely-packed cities into the generative realm with the help of Matthew’s (@frostbitten’s) magic touch.\n\nMatthew—with his background in coding and animation—enables a new opportunity to experience these cities like never before. Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey! \n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you’ve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n—\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n—\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n• https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n—\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others’ skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci à tous! Cheers!\n  - Guillaume Cornet, Matthew Seremet",

In the society I grew up in, being square is what people are being pushed towards. A traditional 9 - 5 in a well paying office job the goal. But I believe that in a world where the majority is square, living the circle life is way more fulfilling.\n\nFor each square in Circles In A Square World there is a small chance a circle will be drawn instead. The series re-uses the palettes that were discovered in Ode to Color as well. \n\nTo watch the drawing process press 'd'.\n\nTo get a higher resolution for printing add ?size=4096 at the end of the URL in the live view (you can use any size you want).",

As is normal on fxhash I have accomplished all this by writing the code that generates the elements in a scene.\nWhile writing the code to obtain these landscapes I did not try to reproduce landscapes seen in reality or in photography, rather I followed from time to time ideas of landscapes that came to my mind as a sort of lucid dream. I hope I managed to convey this idea of a landscape that is halfway between reality and fantasy.\n\nLands and Clouds are rendered using a mix of simplex noise and FBM (Fractional Brownian Motion), trees are generated with recursive functions an placed using Poisson Disk Sampling distribution. The distribution density could be homogeneous (land heightmap drive the density) or biased to have more density towards the top, bottom, left or right of the land.\n\n\nDeveloped with p5.js using WEBGL renderer.\nRendering is faster with chrome browser.\n\n[1] to render at 1600x1600\n[2] to render at 2400x2400\n[3] to render at 3200x3200\n[s] to save a png at last rendered resolution.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\"LandPalette\": 20 colormaps\n\"TreePalette\": 20 colormaps\n\"Light\":  Morning, Evening, Night\n\"SkyColor\": Blue, Azure, Turquoise, Gray, VioletRed\n\"Haze\": True, False\n\"Rainbow\":  True, False\n\"Grayscale\": True, False\n\"TreeDensity\": Homogeneous, Top, Bottom, Left, Right\n\n\nCreated by Andrea Belloni, fxhash: anbello, twitter: @Waterflowing0.

Every step, A and B react with each other and diffuse into neighbouring cells. The amounts of diffusion and reaction have different settings, which can vary across the canvas or over time. Then, cool things happen with colours. \n\nThis is an experimental project, created as part of a Speed Run over ~37 hours in one weekend (I did also sleep and eat in that time. I even went for a walk. Go me). \n- It requires WEBGL2 and is GPU intensive. \n- There may be slight discrepancies in the patterns on different devices, due to rounding. \n\nBig thanks to everyone who followed along/offered advice and especially to Piter Pasma who helped me out with the noise dithering code that took everything to the next dimension.\n\nPress P to pause.\nPress 1-5 to alter speed.

            "description": "Brushstroke is an algorithm to form a minimal, modern, artistic paint on a canvas. It mimics a painter's hand gesture to apply different types of strokes. Those strokes may vary from thin straight lines to fat curvy arcs. The direction of the strokes may change for each stroke or not. There may be an excessive amount of them as there may be just several. Strokes may intersect and form a group. It generates color palettes as an artist does. There are more than twenty parameters that give variety to pieces. \n\nBrushstroke is built on the p5.js library. As a way of saying thanks, you will contribute to the Processing Foundation by collecting this work. ",
