            "description": "My mother lives in the countryside with her husband and her work is the breeding and grazing of goats, cows and horses. They live a cyclical life marked by two big stages during their livestock year: \"La Veranada\" and \"La Invernada\".\nThe \"invernada\" is the place where they live during what we could call the long winter, that is, from April to November. \"La Invernada\" is below, in the plains, in the pampas, in accessible places, where it is easy to supply the animals with fodder.\n\"La Veranada\" is the place where they go during the long summer, from November to April, it is above, in the mountain ranges, on the heights, where the summer pastures abound, where they go for months to take care, alone, of the goats, cows and calves.\nThe transfer of the animals to the summer pasture is called \"Arreo\", my mother's husband guides the animals on his horse. The \"Arreo\" lasts about 5 days.\nIn both places they live in what they call \"el puesto\". \"El puesto\" is their home.\nIn \"La veranada\", \"El puesto\" is simple. A common living room, with a wood stove, a table, some chairs and shelves to store flour, *\"mate\" and salt. A small bedroom replenishes the strength worn out by the daily work. Water for drinking, cooking and washing is drawn from a nearby stream.\nWork is abundant. As a common element, both in winter and summer, my mother's husband rides a horse daily and, accompanied by his dogs, goes to \"watch\" the cattle.\nAs a final point I wanted to thank you for taking your time and reading the story behind this project that I really enjoyed doing it, and on my tw profile you can read this story with real photos.\n\n*Mate: is an Argentinean infusion, which is present all day long in the life of people who live in the countryside. It give you energy.\n\nPress \"S\" in live mode to save image 2600 x 3000.\nPlease note that the algorithm can take some time to run.\nCreated by Fernando. NFT License 2.0.",

            "description": "Another adventure in narrated horology: this work features entirely new texts, authored by AI that I trained on a set of novels. Each minute is an AI prose output, a fragment of a novel that doesn't exist, generated from the time itself.\n\nThe form factor is ideal for smaller window sizes and displays, although it will scale to any size. With the right device, you could probably wear it on your wrist.\n\nNearly 5,000 unique text templates are included, many of which feature variable character names, for which I sourced approximately 1.8 million possible first names and 150,000 possible surnames from U.S. Census data: https://github.com/rossgoodwin/american-names\n\nI wanted to provide just enough text for each minute so that you could read the whole excerpt before the minute ends, though you might need to read briskly. None of the passages have been edited manually, and some remain quite glitchy, as intended. You may recognize a few motifs or proper names here and there, depending on the books you're familiar with, but each passage remains wholly original otherwise.\n\nEach edition features either a linear or nonlinear text sequence:\n\nNonlinear editions will all show one of two possible template texts for each minute, and will read like fragments from multiple (strange and glitchy) novels. Nonlinear sequences feature independently generated texts, with variable character names unique to each minute of each edition.\n\nLinear editions will all show the same template text for each minute, and will read like (strange and glitchy) 24-hour novels. For linear sequences, I utilized a generative prompting technique in which each minute's text is generated partially from the text of the minute before it. Variable character names for linear sequences are unique to each edition and repeat throughout the day.\n\nAesthetic possibilities for each edition include 16 color palettes, 8 fonts, 7 depths, 5 types of numerals, and 3 types of hands. Some editions have color-accented second hands and minute marks, while others appear more static and minimalist, without any numerals or second hand at all.\n\nThis token relies on p5.js for the clockwork, vanilla JS for the text.\n\n\n\nDouble click to toggle fullscreen.\n\nPush `d` to download current minute's text as a .txt file.",

            "description": "Another adventure in narrated horology: this work features entirely new texts, authored by AI that I trained on a set of novels. Each minute is an AI prose output, a fragment of a novel that doesn't exist, generated from the time itself.\n\nThe form factor is ideal for smaller window sizes and displays, although it will scale to any size. With the right device, you could probably wear it on your wrist.\n\nNearly 5,000 unique text templates are included, many of which feature variable character names, for which I sourced approximately 1.8 million possible first names and 150,000 possible surnames from U.S. Census data: https://github.com/rossgoodwin/american-names\n\nI wanted to provide just enough text for each minute so that you could read the whole excerpt before the minute ends, though you might need to read briskly. None of the passages have been edited manually, and some remain quite glitchy, as intended. You may recognize a few motifs or proper names here and there, depending on the books you're familiar with, but each passage remains wholly original otherwise.\n\nEach edition features either a linear or nonlinear text sequence:\n\nNonlinear editions will all show one of two possible template texts for each minute, and will read like fragments from multiple (strange and glitchy) novels. Nonlinear sequences feature independently generated texts, with variable character names unique to each minute of each edition.\n\nLinear editions will all show the same template text for each minute, and will read like (strange and glitchy) 24-hour novels. For linear sequences, I utilized a generative prompting technique in which each minute's text is generated partially from the text of the minute before it. Variable character names for linear sequences are unique to each edition and repeat throughout the day.\n\nAesthetic possibilities for each edition include 16 color palettes, 8 fonts, 7 depths, 5 types of numerals, and 3 types of hands. Some editions have color-accented second hands and minute marks, while others appear more static and minimalist, without any numerals or second hand at all.\n\nThis token relies on p5.js for the clockwork, vanilla JS for the text.\n\n\n\nDouble click to toggle fullscreen.\n\nPush `d` to download current minute's text as a .txt file.",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch B remains simple. The basic grid of Sketch A is there, but is starting to be filled. Grid lines are trimmed as if sketched. Colors continue to be borrowed from Echos/Orbits and new colors from Bent are incorporated. Grid size, padding, line thickness, fill color, and fill percentage and patterns vary.",

An experiment mixing a physical device and generative art. Beyond the classic Fx(Hash) collection, an opportunity to generate new outputs using your portrait as a seed and to get the result printed on thermal paper.\n\n//Learn more about the project:\nhttps://www.parseerror.net/portfolio/paper-camera/ \n\nTwo ways to generate outputs:\n\n// The classic way: \n- By minting an edition on FxHash! :)\n\n// The paper way (using the physical device):\n- Stand in front of the Paper Camera and press the button\n- The device captures your portrait\n- Your portrait is used as a seed to generate an output\n- The device prints your photo + generated art + QR Code\n- Scan the QR code to watch your output live on a screen\n\nNote: The outputs generated by the Paper Camera are not NFTs and are not part of the collection available on Fx(Hash). This new way of generating outputs is a playful approach to let people experience the joy of minting generative art in a physical setup (during exhibitions or events) and to play with the project with a new perspective. \n\nControls\n// S - Save as high resolution png\n// C - Unlock camera (use your mouse, rotate/zoom to find new views!)\n// On mobile – Double tap to unlock the camera\n\nMade with ThreeJS\n2022 - Parse/Error",

An experiment mixing a physical device and generative art. Beyond the classic Fx(Hash) collection, an opportunity to generate new outputs using your portrait as a seed and to get the result printed on thermal paper.\n\n//Learn more about the project:\nhttps://www.parseerror.net/portfolio/paper-camera/ \n\nTwo ways to generate outputs:\n\n// The classic way: \n- By minting an edition on FxHash! :)\n\n// The paper way (using the physical device):\n- Stand in front of the Paper Camera and press the button\n- The device captures your portrait\n- Your portrait is used as a seed to generate an output\n- The device prints your photo + generated art + QR Code\n- Scan the QR code to watch your output live on a screen\n\nNote: The outputs generated by the Paper Camera are not NFTs and are not part of the collection available on Fx(Hash). This new way of generating outputs is a playful approach to let people experience the joy of minting generative art in a physical setup (during exhibitions or events) and to play with the project with a new perspective. \n\nControls\n// S - Save as high resolution png\n// C - Unlock camera (use your mouse, rotate/zoom to find new views!)\n// On mobile – Double tap to unlock the camera\n\nMade with ThreeJS\n2022 - Parse/Error",

Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch C has added a subtractive / destructive element to the simple grid from Sketches A and B. Colors are mostly the same, but more variation has been added to the outputs as well as the hue and saturation of the colors themselves. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.",
