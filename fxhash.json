            "description": "As a lifelong enthusiast of all things furry, I am continually captivated by the soft and luxurious feel of fur and the many forms it takes in the natural world. From wild animals velvety coats to the comfort of plush blankets and pillows, fur has a special quality that evokes warm and cozy feelings.\n\nFor many people, the touch of soft fur on their skin brings back memories of the safety and security of home. This sense of comfort can be especially powerful, providing a refuge from the turmoil and unpredictability of the outside world.\n\nWhether it is the shimmering pile of a top-quality carpet, the fluffiness of a cherished pet, or the stiff and rough fur of a bristly shepherd dog, the texture and appearance of fur is truly mesmerizing. It is not surprising that it has been a subject of human fascination throughout history and continues to be so even today.\n\nWith this project, I attempted to embody that cozy feeling by experimenting with various shapes and techniques while still maintaining a furry appearance.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\n\nThe generation of a hi-res image, up to 8.000x8.000 pixels, takes some time and you can see the drawing process happening in real-time.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters and pressing the following keys the artwork will regenerate at a different scale:\n\n- 1 -> 2.160x2.160\n- 2 -> 4.000x4.000\n- 3 -> 6.000x6.000\n- 4 -> 8.000x8.000\n\n=============> PROFILES <==============\n\nThere are 15 distinct profiles, each with varying levels of rarity:\n\nShattered -----> 18%\nInvalidated ---> 10%\nIntersect -----> 9%\nStrippy -------> 7.5%\nSweater -------> 6.5%\nSmally --------> 6.5%\nKasparov ------> 6.5%\nTriangle ------> 6%\nShell ---------> 6%\nMononoke ------> 6%\nSpiral --------> 4.5%\nSplatter ------> 4.5%\nSquiggle ------> 4%\nMcFly ---------> 3%\nKocinski ------> 2%\n\nThe \"Invalidated\" profile features a unique mode that can occur with a 7.7% chance, which includes blood marks as a tribute to a personal story that frequently came to mind during the development of this project.\n\nAs a child, I once snuck into the kitchen with the intention of stealing some Torrone while my mother was sleeping on the couch in the living room. I used a chair to reach the cupboard and was able to successfully obtain the sweet grail. I then grabbed a large knife to cut it, but while I was putting all my effort into cutting the hard candy, I failed to remove my left hand from under it. As a result, the blade sliced through the tip of my middle finger, causing me to start bleeding profusely. I ran to my mother, crying for help. When she woke up and saw me, she scolded me, saying: \"Move away from the carpet! You're ruining it with all that blood!\"\n\nI still bear a distinct line-shaped scar on my fingerprint today.\n\n=============> MAMIE <==============\n\nThis project is a tribute to my beloved grandmother Lucille, who recently passed away. Regrettably, I was unable to attend her funeral and I wanted to express my reverence for her wonderful spirit in this way. Her home in Blanquefort was abundant with soft and plushy surfaces, ranging from moquettes and carpets to stuffed toys and velvety cushions. As a child, it felt like the coziest place on earth.\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\n\nPowered by p5 and chroma.",

I have scanned these old documents and cut glyphs from them to form a family of fonts.

As her eldest child and only daughter, I was left to make the decision and it was a tortuous one.  I felt that I should care for her at home even though I knew that trying to do so would break me quite quickly.\n\nRecently, cleaning out her home in preparation for selling it, I found a cache of old documents - birth certificates, death certificates, marriage licenses, military records, etc.  I had needed to put my struggles into some cathartic exercise, and suddenly it dawned on me what I wanted to do.  I have scanned these old documents and cut glyphs from them to form a family of fonts.  I’ve then used these fonts to create Measure of a Life.\n\nIt seems only yesterday that I ran wild on the farm, my parents and grandparents a forcefield of security, and death something too abstract and distant to have any meaning.  Now I stand at the apex of my family, the bridge between the generations ranging behind me and those before me, my great-granddaughter now the feral child.  How do I feel about this position?  Everything and nothing, a chaos that can only be expressed somewhere beyond words. How does one measure a life - a few documents, a few photos, a plot in the cemetery, a great pang in the heart?\n\nThis work continues a pricing innovation I introduced with my first work of 2023, What If.  For the first week, collectors of my previous projects may collect the token for free.  At the beginning of the 2nd week, the remaining editions will be offered for sale to new collectors. At the beginning of the third week, the remaining editions will be burned. I intend to use this sales approach through June, 2023 while releasing at least one project per month. My goals are to 1)reduce my fretting about the sales and marketing aspects of my art, 2)reward my supporters, and 3)encourage livelier secondary trading of my work. \n\nThis piece uses custom fonts created by the artist as visual and symbolic components.

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

The colors, textures, and movements of the artwork are all meticulously crafted through code, with every detail carefully considered to capture the essence of these natural wonders.\n\nThe use of pure code to generate these landscapes serves to highlight the beauty and complexity of mathematics and computer programming. \nIt is a testament to the power of technology and its ability to create stunning works of art that evoke deep emotions and inspire creativity.\n\nAs you gaze upon the art, you are drawn into a world of tranquility and natural beauty. The peacefulness of the mountains and the endless expanse of the ocean come to life, inviting you to explore and discover the wonders of the natural world. \nThis art project is a celebration of the beauty of nature and the incredible potential of generative art.\n\n\nby Samanta and Rosetta196 2023",
