However, whereas the previous work was characterized by simplicity and regularity, this one is much more chaotic.\n\nFirst, while in the previous work the grids were fixed at 3 x 3, in this work there are variations from 5 x 5 to 20 x 20. \nAnd in this work, it is YOU who rotates the grid. Clicking on a grid rotates it 90 degrees and changes the image. If you have difficulty locating the grid, press the \"g\" key on the keyboard to display a guide (for touch devices, long press to show/hide the guide).\nIf you get tired of clicking, you can ask your computer to help you. You can toggle the animation mode with the \"a\" key on the keyboard (for touch devices, swipe up to turn on the mode, swipe down to turn it off). In animation mode, the computer rotates a random grid at regular intervals. (The surrounding frame turns green in animation mode.)\n\nThe fun of generative art lies in finding value, or to stretch the point a bit, destiny, in the random coincidences created by computers. Therefore, it is not aesthetically pleasing to artificially modify the derived result later. However, dynamism is also a characteristic of digital art. The fluidity of the results is probably one of its interesting features. I experimented with it in my previous work, \"Abstract Calligraphy\"(Project #15384), and have done it more characteristically in this project.\n\nThis picture is like a puzzle game, but there is no correct answer. No, there may be a correct answer. It depends on your aesthetic sense. Let's enjoy collaborating with the computer!",
