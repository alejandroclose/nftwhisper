Suddenly the daughter got sick and died like a collapsing star. God gets alone, angry, depressed and finally mad. He turned all the universe to ash and mixed the ash of her daughter's soul with it to make her alive, But he failed. In the end, he decided to destroy himself to make a New cosmos of all generative planets from ash of himself and his daughter's soul to one more time in the eternity they can be with each other in a heart of a planet. If you listen carefully to the planets, you may hear them calling each other.\n\n⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛\n\n🔴〰Rarity〰🔴\n\nThis collection is a 3D generative interactive artwork (Made with Unity Game Engine) that contains of 9999+1 planets (1 shared source of light and 9999 pieces of souls) from billions of variation. You can see more random variations from fxhash page.\n◼ The beauty and complexity of the Planet's surface is important, But what is going on inside?\nEach planet has three grades of volume (High, Medium, Low) that show you what resources exist on the planets (Common, Rare, Legendary).\nSome resources are so valuable and infrequent.\n◼ For Example: It's possible to get Oxygen (Legendary Resource) on Low volume slot, but it's infrequent if you get it on High volume slot.\n◼ Checkout Material rarity list on webpage.\n\n📎 Webpage address: HashProtocol.tez.page\n\n⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛\n\n🔵〰Social〰🔵\n\n◼ Participant in events or get achievements to win some prizes.\nSo it's significant to see you on the discord server.

            "description": "'Tesseract' is a generative collection drawing on the concept of the cube from oneirology, the interpretation of dreams. In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

The pixels are constantly rearranging, being transferred from offer to taker, liquify, appear and disappear. They are forming endless compositions, sometimes intransparent or with strange spins.\n\nThe level of abstraction has been set to a 2x pixel size and the color palette of the NES with 12 different color modes. 16 pixel patterns serve as the fundamental building blocks and a simplex noise field determines the direction of movement.\n\nclick || space => pause/unpause\n\nView all tr4ns4ctions at https://tr4ns4ctions.com\n\nKim Asendorf, 2022",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM.

While the palettes may not always reflect their trademark colors (if they even have any) they are an homage to individual pieces by the respective artists that have influenced this series in their own way.\n\n4878 bytes of Vanilla JS with no libraries.\n\nFor more info on the chosen palettes and other inspirations, see article linked from the main project page: Regarding Verdant Brut\n\nIn live mode:\n‘S’ : save as png (2376 × 3360)\n’V’ : save as svg (without grain)\n\nURL params in live mode:\n‘g=n’ : no grain\n‘g=p’ : paper grain\n‘h=t’ : high resolution mode, 5940 × 8400 (Chrome only)\n\nFor example, if you wanted paper grain in high resolution, append “&g=p&h=t” to the url in live mode.\n\nAfter rendering with these params, tapping 'P' will then save the png with those settings applied.",

            "description": "Richter is the second collaboration of Richard Nadler and Leander Herzog, following their first project called Gerhard. A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time.\n \nRichter works with data from 4 of 24 highres images, 30mb in total. This is the maximum size fxhash allows for a project and three times more than Gerhard. Richard Nadler created stunning new textures, enabling more variation in composition and detail to emerge at much higher resolution. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Richter elevates the approach from Gerhard with new methods for the realtime rendering process and new features like offline-first caching. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels as data.\n \nRichter is featured in the exhibition \"Generative Abstraction\" at Expanded.art in Berlin.\n \n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color.\n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen.\n- Press “s” to save the canvas.\n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nleanderherzog.ch/2023/richter/\nleanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/\nfxhash.xyz/generative/17030/",

Attractor is a visualization of community, a central interest bringing people together, pushing past their walls, bad habits, and traumas. The image is meant to be deceiving in its focus on the attractor, where the true focus is on the overlaps and complex defenses we build around ourselves. Those defenses can make us and those connections into more beautiful, ornate structures, or keep us distant from those around us. Sometimes focusing on a shared attractor is the only way we can let down our guard.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a .png\nPress ’t’ to toggle the grain for printing or personal preference\nPress ‘p’ to save a higher quality .png\nCreated with p5.js and chroma.js",
