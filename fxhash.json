            "description": "When i first read an article about how retired New York subway cars were dropped into the Atlantic ocean to serve as man-made reefs, my first thought was: \"does the ocean truly turn them into reefs? Do they want the cars?\". And sure the ocean did. The next photos showed the subway cars rail handles and seats were all covered by barnacles and swarmed by fish. The same thing happened to the hazardous city of Pripyat. 35 years later after the reactor meltdown that resulted in city-wide evacuation, leaving buildings abandoned for years. With no presence of human lives, this gave way for the nature around it to change, some modified genetically, but a lot more now - flourish.\n\nAt the same time, humans have known how to reclaim land from the sea, terraforming hills and valleys to build structures to move people far away, open forests to grow food that will feed the growing mass, and flatten any available lands to build houses that will shelter billions. We seem to flourish even more too.\n\nWhen I created Reclaiming, I thought of nature as an entity that is neither good nor bad. Although human civilization has been advancing more than ever, it feels as if nature is indifferent to the advancement or plight of mankind, and that somehow feels reassuring. The moment we are ready to stop stacking concrete, we will see stem peeking through some cracks. The relationship of nature and humans has been an act of reclaiming parts of each other to survive. Is this humans claiming their nature, or does it belong to nature to begin with?\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Nov22",

            "description": "When i first read an article about how retired New York subway cars were dropped into the Atlantic ocean to serve as man-made reefs, my first thought was: \"does the ocean truly turn them into reefs? Do they want the cars?\". And sure the ocean did. The next photos showed the subway cars rail handles and seats were all covered by barnacles and swarmed by fish. The same thing happened to the hazardous city of Pripyat. 35 years later after the reactor meltdown that resulted in city-wide evacuation, leaving buildings abandoned for years. With no presence of human lives, this gave way for the nature around it to change, some modified genetically, but a lot more now - flourish.\n\nAt the same time, humans have known how to reclaim land from the sea, terraforming hills and valleys to build structures to move people far away, open forests to grow food that will feed the growing mass, and flatten any available lands to build houses that will shelter billions. We seem to flourish even more too.\n\nWhen I created Reclaiming, I thought of nature as an entity that is neither good nor bad. Although human civilization has been advancing more than ever, it feels as if nature is indifferent to the advancement or plight of mankind, and that somehow feels reassuring. The moment we are ready to stop stacking concrete, we will see stem peeking through some cracks. The relationship of nature and humans has been an act of reclaiming parts of each other to survive. Is this humans claiming their nature, or does it belong to nature to begin with?\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Nov22",

            "description": "I recall living for quite some time in urban village areas, where they formed within a striking urban setting. Unlike suburban houses where spaces are ample and most housings are planned with careful consideration of other houses, these urban villages are limited by site and geographic boundaries. So it's almost inevitable that houses are built so close with each other, so much that no house has a backyard or front yard, everything was just roof and walls as far as the eye can see. Because these dwellings grow persistently according to the wants and needs of their dwellers, as the families within these walls grow, so does the urban village.\n\nIt's a chaotic scene for sure, but urban villages have their own candid beauty. Just by looking from the stacked facades of the walls that made up the houses, we can imagine the warm dynamic between the people and strong living impulses that spark from behind these walls.\n\n------------\n20 Color Palettes\nZoomed-in View\nVarious Window Shapes\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\n\n\nCreated using p5.js\nDirbots - Oct22",

They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

            "description": "When i first read an article about how retired New York subway cars were dropped into the Atlantic ocean to serve as man-made reefs, my first thought was: \"does the ocean truly turn them into reefs? Do they want the cars?\". And sure the ocean did. The next photos showed the subway cars rail handles and seats were all covered by barnacles and swarmed by fish. The same thing happened to the hazardous city of Pripyat. 35 years later after the reactor meltdown that resulted in city-wide evacuation, leaving buildings abandoned for years. With no presence of human lives, this gave way for the nature around it to change, some modified genetically, but a lot more now - flourish.\n\nAt the same time, humans have known how to reclaim land from the sea, terraforming hills and valleys to build structures to move people far away, open forests to grow food that will feed the growing mass, and flatten any available lands to build houses that will shelter billions. We seem to flourish even more too.\n\nWhen I created Reclaiming, I thought of nature as an entity that is neither good nor bad. Although human civilization has been advancing more than ever, it feels as if nature is indifferent to the advancement or plight of mankind, and that somehow feels reassuring. The moment we are ready to stop stacking concrete, we will see stem peeking through some cracks. The relationship of nature and humans has been an act of reclaiming parts of each other to survive. Is this humans claiming their nature, or does it belong to nature to begin with?\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Nov22",
