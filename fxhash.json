            "description": "This is a work about growth, impermanence and decay. Ghostly plants and flowers grow around an invisible point, but they immediately begin to fade into the dark background and are soon replaced and covered by others. This process of accumulation and disappearance builds an ever-changing floral garland, or perhaps a funeral wreath.\n\nThe monochrome vegetation is part of a fictional flora, born out of random algorithmic combinations, and does not intend to reproduce any real species. It belongs to an “artificial nature” which, like so many worlds that the computers generate for us in movies, games, and virtual reality environments, is a convincing simulation of life, but it is not actually living. AI bots, virtual assistants and non-player characters are also representatives of the uncanny realm of the not-really-alive-but-looking-like-it, which are becoming an increasingly relevant presence in our everyday lives.\n\nThese plants and flowers speak about life as a process of incessant renovation, but also about death as the background that’s always there and makes life possible. This spectral vegetation seems to thrive precisely at the verge between both worlds.\n_______________\n\n\nThis work is animated and will adapt to any screen size. It generates a never-ending ring of algorithmic foliage, which never repeats itself, and is different for each token. The image preview is triggered after the first five plants or flowers.\nMade with p5.js\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture",

It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

            "description": "This project draws inspiration from the dynamic and exploratory ethos of Hic Et Nunc's early days, when artists were venturing into the possibilities of NFTs and pushing creative boundaries.\n\nThe color palettes were inadvertently provided by some talented artists who had originally intended them for another project, which was ultimately completed but never published.\nHarvey McFly is to blame for the leak.\n\nThe color palettes have been paired together, creating an unexpected chromatic collaboration between the artists.\n\nI have chosen to mint this project from TheWallet, as it represents one of the most intriguing experiments ever conducted on a blockchain.\n\nThis is the inaugural work to be published on fx(hash) through TheWallet, and I hope that other artists will follow suit and engage in this playful and nonsensical practice in the future.\n\nA special thanks goes out to @TheWalletNft, who suggested the idea of minting on fx(hash) and handled the profile setup on the site.\n\nThe open and collaborative nature of TheWallet allows anyone with the seed phrase to modify the sale and to publish any kind of content from TheWallet. For this reason this profile is not, and should never be verified by fx(hash) and collectors should pay extra caution when collecting from it.\n\nYours, CCDDBB\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\nPowered by p5 and chroma.\n\n----------------------------------------------\nTheWallet original post: https://typed.art/967\n----------------------------------------------\n\n",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines II. Enfantillages Pittoresques” is the second of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Enfantillages Pittoresques” experiments with predefined plots, colour blending, webgl shaders, and generative music; all with a fresh, childish style. This algorithm has been trained to draw basic shapes in accordance to Satie’s lyrics. However, it uses them in unusual ways and creates what looks like fantastic creatures, microscopic beings, or, to follow Corneille, Constant, and Appel: \"human animals\".\n\n“It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child” Attributed to Picasso (falsely, probably)\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines” are best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, these have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\nPress M or Double Tap (mobile) for AUDIO mode\nWait for SILENT mode\nPress I for Trait Info (desktop)\nPress 1 for Canvas Save (desktop)\n\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=171” after URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=X” for HQ renders (standard is 2, and 8 produces 400ppi 40x44cm prints).\n\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been compressed and minified for a performance boost, but can be read fully in GitHub: https://github.com/ratchitect/\n\n\n# PERFORMANCE\nBetter experienced with Chrome.",

            "description": "Created by Eko33, a generative artist featured at the Tezos Ecosystem Exhibition (Art Basel Miami 2021).\n\nThis generative artwork creates a limited series of distinctive artworks based on unique hash seeds.\n\nThe algorithmic approach of this collection generates a broad spectrum of unique outcomes, inspired by the \"giant machine\" from the movie \"Modern Times.\"\n\nBeyond a classic mechanical representation, Eko33 aims to convey multiple emotions while embracing the cold nature of algorithms.\n\nComputer-generated generative art can be seen as a gigantic assembly line. Still, its true nature gives the artist complete freedom from all commercially available tools/constraints.\n\nThe collection \"Modern Times\" highlights the dark ages of generative arts using a bichromatic color palette and evolves toward the contemporary \"Digital Renaissance\" era using warmer, more acid and \"pop\" colors.\n\nAbout Eko33:\nOfficial fx(hash) page: https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Eko33\nOfficial Website: https://www.eko33.com/\n",
