            "description": "This project uses cellular automata where the state of a cell in a new generation is determined based on its own and its neighbors' states in the previous generation. The guiding rules for these transitions, however, are not static; they undergo a random change every few generations, chosen from a possible 256 rules. By also slightly shifting the positions of cells and using an outline and texture that conveys a hand-drawn style, I have tried introducing an element of organic randomness.\n\nStepping away from the monochromatic color scheme used in my last three series, I have used a gradient effect to convey a transitioning hue across generations, combining a palette of two colors selected from an array of 14 different palettes. \n\nNote on the name: The alternating rules and fluctuating cell positions serve as the apparent justification for its name. However, a subtler inspiration lies in my deep admiration for Franz Kafka and his remarkable short story, \"The Metamorphosis\". Kafka’s narrative explores the constantly evolving state of human existence, where patterns appear momentarily only to dissipate quickly. Just when you think you've spotted a pattern, poof, it changes. Just like in life, right :)\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

            "description": "ecologías - B\n\nwater is the medium where life first appeared in our planet. Water is also indispensable for the continuation of the life that emerged from - and with - it. The advent of AI species and their introduction into society is a new form of cambrian explosion. What is their medium? What is their water? How scarce and precious will it be for them? AI entities are not foreign to human resource necessities, though. The water that is essential to our human life will also be so for machines, as their energy still depends on our natural resources. Therefore, the ecologies of humans and machines will have, at least, the same elements as the ecologies of humans. AIs may help us reach better balances, only if we employ them to do so and if we teach them to help us.\n\necologías-B is an entity that is part of a broader ecology.

The state of each cell in a new generation is influenced by its own state as well as those of its neighboring cells from the last generation. The rules guiding these state transitions, however, are dynamic.\n\nSol for me is an experimental plotter project. As a gesture of my gratitude to minters of Metamorphosis, all minters will be on the reserve list for a free piece of Sol. I’ll take a snapshot of Metamorphosis for the reserve list 30 minutes prior to Sol’s launch. For three days (unless all reserve-holders mint sooner), Sol will be only for those on the reserve list and I'll add anyone who purchases Metamorphosis on primary subsequently. After this period, any remaining pieces, along with an additional 50 mints, will be available for public sale.\n\nA Note on the Name: The inspiration behind the name 'Sol' springs from my visits to SF MoMA, where I always find myself in the space dedicated to Sol LeWitt. Through the repetition and variation of a singular concept, LeWitt constructed forms that were striking, often evolving from basic geometric forms into intricate structures. The same is also echoed in the principle of emergence in cellular automata, where complex systems arise from the interactions of simple components governed by rules. This series, Sol, is a homage to LeWitt's ingenuity in favoring dispassionate geometric forms over the emotionally-infused abstract art styles.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.

            "description": "In 1934, German philosopher Max Bense published his first work “Raum und Ich” (Space & Ego) where he explored the concept of ‘information aesthetics’, proposing that the aesthetic value of an artwork could be derived from its underlying informational structure. \n\nBense asserted that \"Space\" extends beyond physical dimensions into the realm of abstract ideas, mathematical possibilities, and the unseen information shaping an artwork, while acknowledging its potential, boundaries, and prospects.\n\nThe term \"ego,\" usually associated with an artist's subjective impulses and emotional idiosyncrasies, is redefined in Bense's framework. As technology and information theory become integrated into artistic creation, the artist's role changes from a subjective creator to an architect of information and systems.\n\nThirty years later Manfred Mohr, an abstract expressionist, discovered Bense's information aesthetics in early 60’s, and his artistic thinking changed radically. Within a few years, his art transformed to computer generated algorithmic geometry. A pioneer of generative art, Mohr relentlessly explored precise geometric forms, symmetry, and a mathematical approach to art. \n\nWhile Bense’s work continues to provide a philosophical foundation and conceptual framework for generative art, Mohr demonstrated the power of computational processes to produce intellectually engaging artworks. The series 'Space & Ego' pays homage to both Bense and Mohr while initiating a dialogue. \n\nRooted in Mohr's concept of a random point within a square, this series broadens the \"space\" made possible by evolution of generative art. While the plotters of the 1960s were confined to monochromatic outputs, I have experimented with palettes uncommon in plotter projects. My choice of colors was expressive and more in tradition with abstract expressionists of 1960s. \n\nA random point is selected within a square, and the four resulting polygons are filled with lines. The probability of these polygons being filled with lines follows four approaches, ascending and descending from top-left to bottom-right (and vice versa), and radial expansion outward (and vice versa). All works can be plotted and have been designed for a precise fill of colors within the polygons. \n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a PNG of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete SVG file for plotting. \n\nAnd this is a redeemable project in case you’d like to receive a physical plot! \n\nPixel Love!",

            "description": "In 1934, German philosopher Max Bense published his first work “Raum und Ich” (Space & Ego) where he explored the concept of ‘information aesthetics’, proposing that the aesthetic value of an artwork could be derived from its underlying informational structure. \n\nBense asserted that \"Space\" extends beyond physical dimensions into the realm of abstract ideas, mathematical possibilities, and the unseen information shaping an artwork, while acknowledging its potential, boundaries, and prospects.\n\nThe term \"ego,\" usually associated with an artist's subjective impulses and emotional idiosyncrasies, is redefined in Bense's framework. As technology and information theory become integrated into artistic creation, the artist's role changes from a subjective creator to an architect of information and systems.\n\nThirty years later Manfred Mohr, an abstract expressionist, discovered Bense's information aesthetics in early 60’s, and his artistic thinking changed radically. Within a few years, his art transformed to computer generated algorithmic geometry. A pioneer of generative art, Mohr relentlessly explored precise geometric forms, symmetry, and a mathematical approach to art. \n\nWhile Bense’s work continues to provide a philosophical foundation and conceptual framework for generative art, Mohr demonstrated the power of computational processes to produce intellectually engaging artworks. The series 'Space & Ego' pays homage to both Bense and Mohr while initiating a dialogue. \n\nRooted in Mohr's concept of a random point within a square, this series broadens the \"space\" made possible by evolution of generative art. While the plotters of the 1960s were confined to monochromatic outputs, I have experimented with palettes uncommon in plotter projects. My choice of colors was expressive and more in tradition with abstract expressionists of 1960s. \n\nA random point is selected within a square, and the four resulting polygons are filled with lines. The probability of these polygons being filled with lines follows four approaches, ascending and descending from top-left to bottom-right (and vice versa), and radial expansion outward (and vice versa). All works can be plotted and have been designed for a precise fill of colors within the polygons. \n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a PNG of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete SVG file for plotting. \n\nAnd this is a redeemable project in case you’d like to receive a physical plot! \n\nPixel Love!",
