            "description": "All of our strong emotions, feelings and experiences come from childhood. Sincere happiness or frightening cruelty is primarily inherent in children, so they learn about the world. When we were children, we first hurt someone, first burst into tears from resentment, learned what is good and what is bad. \nOur parents did not answer our questions, either because they did not know the answer or because they thought we were too young. We learned to look for the answers ourselves. Whoever says that children don't understand is a fool. They do understand, but they do it in their own way. The world as seen through the eyes of a child is not like the world as seen through the eyes of an adult. It is often not built on the laws of physics or the laws of the marketplace. In a child's world or universe, the moon is just a little light in the sky, and the next street is already a different country. Their world is built on speculation and magical theories. Unfortunately, a child's world is not eternal. As they grow up, the \"real\" life, the life of adults, pokes into them like a sharp needle over and over again. \nThere is something incredibly tragic about this time gap between child and adult. It is this period that I wanted to trace in my work. As teenagers, it is as if we are between two trains, we are no longer children, but we are not yet adults. We get to know ourselves, we test our strength and readiness to exist in the \"real\" world. We are trying to find our place in the unfriendly world of adults, but we are also not ready to let go of the magic of childhood. It confuses, torments, and frustrates us. But it is a necessary and unavoidable tragedy. \n\nCode by PureSpider",

            "description": "This project was started in December 2021. At that time, I didn't know what the result would be. It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

            "description": "De/Frag is an homage to a classic algorithm in early computer art: Flood Fill. As a teenager in the late '80s, and without any literature, I spent weeks implementing a version for my very own drawing program for the Atari XL. It was the first non-trivial (to me) algorithm which made me want to learn more about data structures, the concept of recursion, divide-and-conquer...\n\nEven though Flood Fill was available in most commercial drawing & office apps of the time, I gained a deep appreciation of the algorithm by building it from scratch myself. 30+ years later I know its aesthetic possibilities are still far from exhausted. This is an invitation for re-exploration by others too!\n\nAs with many design algorithms, my primary interest isn't even the final result, but observing the inner workings. I massively slowed down and time-sliced the process for this piece. I do recommend giving each of these unique versions some time to allow them to evolve their ever-changing patterns (Note: each piece never loops!).",
