            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor.

            "description": "\"Anarchy\" aims to pay tribute to the Impressionist masters and explore the interplay between randomness and control. My goal was to capture the bold use of color and the fleeting nature of light and movement that is so characteristic of the Abstract Impressionist style. \n\nThis piece uses a total of 12 color palettes, each one inspired by a different Impressionist painter. Some artists have two palette variations, while others only have one.\n\nI wanted to create something that was unique and that would reflect my own visual emotions while also paying homage to the artists that inspire me. \"Anarchy\" is part of my exploration of the relationship between randomness and intention, and a celebration of the enduring legacy of the Impressionist masters.\n\nMade by wandurz using p5.js \nJanuary 2023\n",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

            "description": "Let me take you places. Those are not in your town, not even on your planet. They’re placed somewhere between reality and subconsciousness.\nEnormous, peculiar structures emerge upon you, refusing to be ignored. They are your unfulfilled cravings or ever-lurking demons. They were always there, under your skin, intangible, now they’ve materialized.\nYou may not like them, they may seem too vast, too scary to tame. But ultimately, you have to face them, unless you enjoy living in their shadow. \n\n___\nInspirations\n\nI’ve never truly realized that, but ever since I remember, the sight of gigantic objects or creatures evoked strong emotions within me.\nIt probably started with playing Shadow of Colossus (a video game) as a kid and seeing The Cathedral (short movie by Tomasz Bagiński). Years later, reading Solaris (by Stanisław Lem) aroused the same feeling (among others) of being mesmerized by the vastness. More recently, movies like Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival (which also nudged my attraction to mystery) and Dune - have charmed me.\n\nEarlier this year I have stumbled across Dawid Planeta (artist and yoga teacher) and began contemplating his visions of mini people in the jungle inhabited by giant animals. These works in particular, plus Hollow - generative series by Jacek Markusiewicz - were probably my final inspirations to make Intangible look the way it does.\n\nSettling semi-random generative structures in some kind of reality, gave them a meaning - they may symbolize things much bigger than you - the ones you try to escape from or those you’ve been longing to experience for years. I have mine, don’t you?\n\n___\nControls in live mode\n\n\nKeyboard\n[ space ] - toggle light animation\n[ S ] - save image with current size (default is 120% of browser window’s height; you may change browser’s scale or check URL size param)\n[ F ] - fullscreen \n[ up / down ] - light intensity\n[ left / right ] - base light position\n[ 1..5 ] - aspect ratio: 10:16 („zero” ratio), 1:1.4142 (vertical A4), 1:1, 1.4142 (horizontal A4), 16:10\n[ B ] - toggle border\n[ Z ] - toggle canvas „raw” mode - no shadow / margin (auto applied in fullscreen mode)\n[ N ] - toggle „that thing you may not want on print”\n\n\nURL params\nYou may add any number of parameters to the URL to start it with particular settings. \n[ animate ] (1/0) - toggle light animation\n[ size] (number) - number of px for longer edge, i.e. 4000\n[ ratio ] (number or ratio with format: 10/16, 10:16, 10_16) - aspect ratio\n[ light ] (number 40..120, some palettes have slightly different limits for good results) - light intensity\n[ lightShift] (number -100..100) - base light position\n[ border ] (1/0) - toggle border\n[ hddcy ] (0/1)\n\nExample: [ &size=4000&border=1&light=100&animate=1 ] \n\n\nMobile\n[hold 2 fingers for 2s] - save\n[double tap] - fullscreen\n\n\n___\nNote:\nI encourage you to do some light adjustments before you save an image for print. I’m pretty sure you can do better than fxrand().\n\n\n___\nSpecial thanks to my brother Krzycho, for lots of advices / heathy criticism and to Olga, for never-ending excitement and „dorady”.\n\n___\nDeveloped in Javascript, using p5.js (2D Canvas) and chroma.js.\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n© April-July 2022, MadeUpLifeforms (mulf)\n",

            "description": "In mathematics, physics, and art, moiré patterns are large-scale interference patterns that can be produced when an opaque ruled pattern with transparent gaps is overlaid on another similar pattern. For the moiré interference pattern to appear, the two patterns must not be completely identical, but rather displaced, rotated, or have slightly different pitch. We can also say that moiré effect is a “secondary and visually evident superimposed pattern created when two patterns overlap” but they aren't limited to forms in motion.\nFrom a different point-of-view, new perceptions can pop out from the screen according to velocity, frequency and position of the patterns turning this visual experience unique.\n\nHere, we got very fine lines obtained from the reciprocal exponential function (something like y = 1/A^x) and the color are mapped according the frame counting in HSL mode. This combination of parameters allows us to get very vibrant and colorful gradients that moves smoothly in ellipsoidal routes in the canvas. Sometimes the cold saturated tones in monochromatic beams remembers something like lasers in techno/electronic music festivals. On the other hand, the lighter and hot tones have a lot more character like sunrays in the early morning peaking through curtains trying to wake you up.\n\nOptionally, the collector can toggle:\n- 'S' to save\n- 'P' to add a translucent Polaroid layer with a fine typography*\n* This typography will reveal if you got an rare feature (★ ★ ★) and if yes, you will get a 2 pieces from Pastelhood.\n\nThere are another special rare features, I hope you like it.\n\nSimple is beautiful!\n\nD. & Tiyen\n__________________________________\nSeptember 2022.",

            "description": "\"The Wintertime\" is a collection of generative art that captures the essence of the winter season in a glitchy and abstract way. The pieces in this collection are a visual representation of the harshness and beauty of winter, where the cold and barren landscapes are juxtaposed against the sparkling snow and ice. The glitches and digital distortions in the art add a sense of chaos and unpredictability, mirroring the unpredictable nature of winter weather. The collection celebrates the winter season in all its raw and untamed glory. Each piece is unique and evocative, inviting the viewer to get lost in the beauty of the wintertime.\n\nThe work was inspired by the drip painting technique of Jackson Pollock and the minimalistic elegance of Japanese prints. Combining these two distinct styles creates a visually striking and thought-provoking collection that pays homage to the masters while pushing the boundaries of contemporary art.\n\nThis collection is the continuation of GPTree: https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/17691\n\nGenuary 2023: Recursive trees",
