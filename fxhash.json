Different species evolve and interact together, resulting in stabilizing patterns out of their parametric configurations. A form of artificial life.\n\nThis work is based on the paper \"Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks\", written by Jeff Jones and popularized in the artistic field by Sage Jenson. Some features were added to increase the visual and behavioral complexity of the system. Agents are divided into different species, with their own set of rules and interacting with their own substrate. Substrates also interact with each other and agents will mutate in contact of some of them.\n\nNFT License\nRuns properly on Chrome 97.0.4692.99\nGPU intensive\n\nPress P to pause (double tab touch devices)\nPress",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "RAUSCH is a series of generative artworks that explore imaginary digital architectures. \n\nThis series challenges traditional notions of architectural representation and raises important questions about the role of resolution in design. Just as the pixel resolution of an image affects its perceived quality, the resolution of an architectural space can affect its qualities and livability. By embracing digital variation through codes, this series explores the interplay between abstract and concrete space through multiple resolutions. \n\nRAUSCH is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by complex, chaotic and messy sensations, and aims to engage the viewer through a sense of wonder, disorientation, and awe.\n\nReleased on the occasion of Companions of Code, a group exhibition by VerticalCrypto Art at The NFT Gallery in London. \nCurated by Micol Ap. Exhibition 10-24 February 2023 \n\n___________________________________________________\nRAUSCH Controls:\n\nAnimation: \n• ‘1 - 2 - 3 - 4’ animate views\n• 'MouseClick' pause/play animation\n\nFunctions:\n(press key & wait)\n• 'F' 24 FPS\n• 'B' b/w mode \n\nResize Canvas:\n(press key & wait)\n• '6' Portrait A4 - 1000x1414\n• '7' Landscape 16:9 - 1920x1080\n• '8' Portrait 9:16 - 1080x1920\n• '9' Square 1:1 - 1024x1024\n• 'DoubleClick' Fullscreen\n\nSave & Export Image:\n• 'S' save a .png of in current resolution\n\nSave & Export GIF:\n• 'G' save a 1-2 sec. seamless loop .gif of current view \n• 'P' save a 12-24 sec. seamless loop .gif of all the views\n• 'T’ scale down current resolution, save a 12 sec. seamless loop .gif\n\nSteps to save a gif/png :\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• resize canvas with 6,7,8, or 9 to your desired aspect ratio (wait)\n• press S,G or P to save & download (wait) \n• enjoy RAUSCH :)\n\nSave & Export GIF for social media sharing:\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• press T or G wait for recalculation & download. \n• enjoy RAUSCH \n• post on Twitter ;)\n__________________________________________________\n\nThis token may not work on mobile(!), but it allows exporting .png and .gif (see controls) to enjoy RAUSCH on different displays or mobile.

According to legend, an ancient civilization of high intelligence, called the Explorers of Latent Space, distributed hundreds of monoliths throughout time and space in order to study the behavior of species in the infinite Universe.\n\nSome say that it is the divine intelligence of God. Others say that, in spite of their objectual and material condition, the monoliths possess their own consciousness and an intelligence beyond the natural and artificial.

            "description": "This experimental project involves an on-chain cellular automaton. The features and cellular automaton rules are derived from the minter's address. Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",

            "description": "Design and Form, a fundamental course at the Bauhaus, played a pivotal role in shaping the renowned art school's unique approach to design education. Founded in 1919 by architect Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus sought to bridge the gap between art and industry, promoting the idea that design should be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The Design and Form course served as a cornerstone of this philosophy, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and techniques that underpin all forms of visual expression.\n\nAt the heart of the Design and Form course was the exploration of the fundamental elements of design, such as line, shape, color, and texture. Students were encouraged to experiment with these elements through hands-on exercises, engaging in a process of discovery and self-expression. The course emphasized the importance of developing a keen sense of observation and a deep understanding of materials, enabling students to create harmonious compositions that seamlessly blended form and function.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of the Design and Form course was its interdisciplinary nature. The Bauhaus believed that design should transcend traditional boundaries, and students from various disciplines, including painting, sculpture, architecture, and crafts, came together to learn and collaborate. This interdisciplinary approach fostered a rich exchange of ideas, inspiring students to push the boundaries of their respective fields and embrace new ways of thinking. The Design and Form course at the Bauhaus laid the foundation for the school's revolutionary approach to design education, leaving an indelible mark on the world of art and design.\n\nThis is the second study exploring different zoom factor, composition and base sequence creation. If you how \"Study One\" you might want to get this one as well.\n\n-\tHit s for svg export\n-\tHit p for png export\n\nParams for palette, form factor, mode and composition seed ",

Franke, a pioneer of computer art, passed away on July 16, 2022 at the age of 95. CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE is an homage to Franke’s MONDRIAN software developed for the Texas Instruments TI 99/4 home computer in 1979, and it’s a fundraiser to digitize his archive:\n\n“Our goal is to raise 20,000 Euro so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. If we raise more money, it will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.” \n\nEach frame, a single “pixel” is added to the CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE image. When the software first loads, 100,000 frames are run in the background to start things off. Keep it running for hours or days to see it transform entirely — it’s an “infinite animation.”",

In all that vastness, we are the smallest fraction of time imaginable, floating around on a speck of dust. Yet somehow, we continue to work, learn, build relationships, create, and participate in all these other odd, uniquely human practices. It’s truly fascinating, when in the grand scheme, none of it seems consequential.\n\nAmara Celestial is an artistic representation of this intergalactic madness and the love for it. To expand on the project’s identity…Amara, my wife’s name, has many meanings. In her culture and family, it means “love” or “everlasting beauty”. Celestial most commonly refers to things not of this world, but from the sky, or space. The shapes, lines, and primary design of this project represent the unpredictable nature of the universe. The entire piece is stippled with thousands of points of various palette selected colors, to resemble the uncountable number of light sources in the great sea of space, as well as to provide textural depth.\n\nThe Features:\n- Canvas Style: Pretty simple, the canvas can be square (2048 x 2048), portrait (1352 X 2048) or landscape (2048 x 1352).\n- Palettes: There are 10 different palettes, each with equal chance of being randomly chosen. The palettes were heavily influenced by my wife. She is a woman of South American descent and loves the bright colors and contrast often seen in the traditional clothing and art of her culture. There are a few muted palettes, including a mono palette to mix things up!\n- Background Color: The background color can be black, white, or blue with varying rarity.\n- Background Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the background shape (if drawn).\n- Primary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the primary shape (i.e., the foremost shape).\n- Secondary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the secondary shape.\n- Posterize: This is a color limiting filter that can cause harsher (less smooth) changes in color. The lower the number, the more abrupt the changes (2 being the lowest allowed).\n- Primary Shape Centered: This is a true/false based on whether the primary shape is centered on the canvas.\n- Background override: This will override the selected background and replace it with vertical or horizontal lines, or prevent the background shape from being drawn entirely.\n\nOther randomness factors (non-features)\n- Stroke thickness on various shapes and points of the project.\n- Size of the overall shapes, as well as the size of the inner radius of the shapes.\n- Spacing between the stippling and lines (to keep it pattern-less).\n- Positioning of all the shapes (restricted to the canvas).\n- The number of iterations (rings) for each shape.",

            "description": "Graphic compositions made with simple elements. Playing with the subtlety and rhythm of colors, shapes and textures.\n\nThis work was inspired by the textures of monotype prints and those of metal engraving. Especially in the geometric marks made by the inking roller while stretching the graphic ink to make a manual printing. It is a tribute to the visuality of handmade prints.\n\n\"Monotipia\" means monotype printing in Portuguese. It is a graphic printing process that results in a single copy. Here I make a parallel between monotype printing and the code+hash minting process, which also produces a single image.\n\n---\nFeatures:\n-> 15 composition schemes\n-> 51 handpicked base colors\n-> 3 canvas formats:  \n-----> Portrait (vertical) \n-----> Square \n-----> Landscape (horizontal)\n-> 3 element tones options: \n-----> Light Texture & Shapes\n-----> Light Texture / Dark Shapes \n-----> Dark Texture & Shapes\n\n---\nTo save the image as a png file, type:\n[1] save at actual size \n[2] save with 2000px height\n[3] save with 3000px height\n[4] save with 4000px height\n[5] save with 5000px height\n\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n---\nCreated with p5.js\n\n---\nThis is my first project on FX(hash) and I would like to express my special thanks to Janaina Selva, Dmarchi, Gyo and Morbeck for their support and for following the step-by-step development of this work, always contributing with a critical eye and great suggestions. I also thank the help from the FX(hash) community on Discord.\n\n---\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2023\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada",

            "description": "The universe is terrifyingly vast, mostly pitch-dark, save some billions of trillions of stars and planets. We are nothing. In all that vastness, we are the smallest fraction of time imaginable, floating around on a speck of dust. Yet somehow, we continue to work, learn, build relationships, create, and participate in all these other odd, uniquely human practices. It’s truly fascinating, when in the grand scheme, none of it seems consequential.\n\nAmara Celestial is an artistic representation of this intergalactic madness and the love for it. To expand on the project’s identity…Amara, my wife’s name, has many meanings. In her culture and family, it means “love” or “everlasting beauty”. Celestial most commonly refers to things not of this world, but from the sky, or space. The shapes, lines, and primary design of this project represent the unpredictable nature of the universe. The entire piece is stippled with thousands of points of various palette selected colors, to resemble the uncountable number of light sources in the great sea of space, as well as to provide textural depth.\n\nThe Features:\n- Canvas Style: Pretty simple, the canvas can be square (2048 x 2048), portrait (1352 X 2048) or landscape (2048 x 1352).\n- Palettes: There are 10 different palettes, each with equal chance of being randomly chosen. The palettes were heavily influenced by my wife. She is a woman of South American descent and loves the bright colors and contrast often seen in the traditional clothing and art of her culture. There are a few muted palettes, including a mono palette to mix things up!\n- Background Color: The background color can be black, white, or blue with varying rarity.\n- Background Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the background shape (if drawn).\n- Primary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the primary shape (i.e., the foremost shape).\n- Secondary Noise: This controls the level of turbulence in the secondary shape.\n- Posterize: This is a color limiting filter that can cause harsher (less smooth) changes in color. The lower the number, the more abrupt the changes (2 being the lowest allowed).\n- Primary Shape Centered: This is a true/false based on whether the primary shape is centered on the canvas.\n- Background override: This will override the selected background and replace it with vertical or horizontal lines, or prevent the background shape from being drawn entirely.\n\nOther randomness factors (non-features)\n- Stroke thickness on various shapes and points of the project.\n- Size of the overall shapes, as well as the size of the inner radius of the shapes.\n- Spacing between the stippling and lines (to keep it pattern-less).\n- Positioning of all the shapes (restricted to the canvas).\n- The number of iterations (rings) for each shape.",

            "description": "Graphic compositions made with simple elements. Playing with the subtlety and rhythm of colors, shapes and textures.\n\nThis work was inspired by the textures of monotype prints and those of metal engraving. Especially in the geometric marks made by the inking roller while stretching the graphic ink to make a manual printing. It is a tribute to the visuality of handmade prints.\n\n\"Monotipia\" means monotype printing in Portuguese. It is a graphic printing process that results in a single copy. Here I make a parallel between monotype printing and the code+hash minting process, which also produces a single image.\n\n---\nFeatures:\n-> 15 composition schemes\n-> 51 handpicked base colors\n-> 3 canvas formats:  \n-----> Portrait (vertical) \n-----> Square \n-----> Landscape (horizontal)\n-> 3 element tones options: \n-----> Light Texture & Shapes\n-----> Light Texture / Dark Shapes \n-----> Dark Texture & Shapes\n\n---\nTo save the image as a png file, type:\n[1] save at actual size \n[2] save with 2000px height\n[3] save with 3000px height\n[4] save with 4000px height\n[5] save with 5000px height\n\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n---\nCreated with p5.js\n\n---\nThis is my first project on FX(hash) and I would like to express my special thanks to Janaina Selva, Dmarchi, Gyo and Morbeck for their support and for following the step-by-step development of this work, always contributing with a critical eye and great suggestions. I also thank the help from the FX(hash) community on Discord.\n\n---\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2023\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada",
