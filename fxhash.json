            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "'drawz' fxh_t019 is also vanilla javascript template for fxhash\n\n\nfeel free, to use (parts of) it, and learn from the source.\nand use it as a start for your own creative projects and adventures\n\nThis version has some extra routines you can use; \nand a lot of comments in the source\n\n\nA cleaned up - smaller version; just doing the basic tech screen & window-handeling etc. with just drawing dots can be found here.\n(and older and newer updated versions)\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\n\nMostly I start with a clean template; \nthen add: copy-paste routines into it. Things I want to use; sprites, text-font, filters, lines, 3D etc. \nLike kinda lego blocks. Some routines I re-use for 30 years now. \nAlthough often they have changed over time.\n\n\nVanilla javascript - And directly control your rgb buffer\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\ncons:\n- can be overwhelming for starting coders compared to p5js\n- you have to write / use and tinker with new drawing routines by yourself. \n- still can be optimized a lot, and run much faster\n-- (feel free to do that! - release new versions yourself)\n- I just coded it in Notepad++ and tested it in a browser.\n- I have no experience with git-hub, or those other nifty tools\n- I'm more an Artist than a coder, still learning new things as well.\n- I have my own 'old' coding style I picked up ages ago, and still use now and then. Started with basic and Z80a as a teenager.\n- for sure there are still some stupid bugs, spelling errors in it  ^___^\n\npros:\n- fxtemplate - fxpreview when done drawing / splash-screen support on top; while drawing.\n- do like 4000 x 4000 images on safari; on an old Iphone 5\n- just 1 index.html now - small file size: \n- the source of the 'cleaned-up' version is now 34b (not minified, and still comments in the source; can be even smaller)\n- direct control of the RGB buffer; every pixel.\n- I added some basic routines, like drawing points, lines, squares, sprite-brushes, filters, and my pixel-font\n- draw, add-mix or subtract - manipulate every pixel how you wish\n- I work with a big off-screen kind of image; a rgb-buffer; so drawing goes 'mucho' faster and render it to a screen-scaled image.\n- no other libraries used\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nMouse-click switches between:\n- screen scaled image\n- The large image \n\n- The work will refresh and restart after some time\n\nSave image - with s-key \n(includes the fxhash key-seed and num# of the follow-up images)\n--- It can take some seconds before the saving happens; \n--- the browser has to handle (very) large MB .png files first \n--- before it can save them \n\n- splash image support - to hide drawing at start\n- redraw the image after a while; or not.\n- mouse position check for the bigger image\n- fps counter for testing etc.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nwritten in vanilla JavaScript, more info in the source-code\n\n\ndrawz - latest or an updated version can be found at.\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\nIt would be nice; to include more routines into it\nin the future.\n\nAnd instead of 1 big library with everything in it\nI would like to have these templates; \nwhere you can add different little snippets and routines \nthat you want to use into it, and start playing next.\nStill learning new things as well. And getting inspired.\n\nI don't mind people to use the tech-source as a start for their own projects. \n\nBut the palette, and composition & structure build-up; is mine. \nDon't change just 1 or 2 -things then re-release it.\n\nIf you want to release something of your own,\nyour sketch and generative work; really should look total different!\nYou can use the technics to draw new things,\nbut you have to start from scratch again; \nchoosing points, lines etc. to play with and go from there.\nEnjoy! \n\n\n-for the love of Art and jumping in rain puddles-\n\n'like jimi and guitar'  0__.  ^____^\n\n\nxxx  amsterdam  chillout\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n",

            "description": "The 'Unfinished Loom' is a generative system that produces variations of itself through rotations, displacements, and self-repetition. \n\nSelf-similarity in the loom is achieved by repeating the double grid system and its elements vertically (using the 'o' and 'l' keys) and horizontally (using the 'i' and 'k' keys).\n\nPressing 'a' produces automatic changes, while pressing 'x' reverts to the original composition.\n\nBy clicking on the canvas, you can play with colors and transparency. \n\nThe '1' key toggles between disorder and order. \nThe '2' and '3' keys allow you to toggle displacements.\nThe '4' key enables you to switch between entropy or not.\nThe '5' key lets you switch between mixed textures or assigned textures. \n\nYou can reduce, amplify, or flip the displacement using the 'u' or 'j' key. \nTo remove a color press 'c'. To reset to all colors, press 'v'.\n\nYou can save a PNG file using 's', a JPG using 'd', a PNG with twice your window height using 'f', and a print size image using 'g'.\n\nThis work explores composition based on generative double grid system, where rotations, displacements and noisy lines intertwine to form a playful loom.\n\nCreated with p5.js rendering in WEBGL.",

Some forever modes will “never forget” and others will fade as they progress. No idea if that’s a metaphor but it is a trait, that much I know.\n\nAll primary sales are donated to Code/Art, which is a charity that uses “…Art to Inspire Girls in Computer Science.” Read about Code/Art here: https://www.code-art.com/\n\nCeremony uses public domain art (which is the original, more implicit version CC0) made exclusively by women.\n\nSee fxtext article linked from the project page for a gallery of the source material and other notes.\n\nCeremony is also CC0, so feel free use anything here in other projects.\n\nYou can read more about CC0 here:\nhttps://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/\n\nF : “Forever” mode (tap after initial render completes)\nP : Pause/Play\n(mouse click/tap also works to start “Forever” mode or Pause/Play)\n\nA : Add Grain (only works when paused in “Forever” mode.)\nG : Toggle Grain (resets the whole piece)\nM : Toggle Matte (resets the whole piece)\n\nS : Save Image\n1 -> 6 : Set pixel density (resets the whole piece)\n(Default pixel density is 1 @ 2000x2000)\n\nIf you want to start in \"Forever\" mode, you can append \"&forever=true\" to the url in the live view.\nYou can also add pixel density to the url by appending “&density=2” (or 3, 4, etc) to have it render at higher resolutions by default.",

            "description": "This token was created for THE PASSAGE: Pitch Drop experience, an interactive minting experience where your choices determine the design of your token. \n\nTo take part, please purchase an Edition 5 Coin on fx(hash) by HERE & NOW. The artwork and experience draw inspiration from the 'The Pitch Drop Experiment': the world's longest-running laboratory experiment. Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\n____\n\n\nWhile we wait for the 10th drop of pitch to fall in the famous Pitch Drop experiment, I couldn’t avoid thinking about time and change, capturing and preserving a moment of time, the history of art and science, and how we participate in the manipulation of the time itself.  \n\nThe history of new media art is deeply linked to technical developments in photography and its creative applications. With still and moving images, artists were introduced to a new way of visualizing time. Through the use of time lapses, long exposures, slowing down, and fast forwarding, time was manipulated, captured, rearranged, and modified in numerous ways.\n  \nThe French philosopher Henri Bergson believed that reality was in flux and that \"the essence of time is that it goes by.\" His thoughts about time and metaphysics had a significant impact on artists working in all media at the turn of the 20th century. Although he believed in pure perception unaided by machines, and looked down on the introduction of technology into the arts, for artists, who had always been fascinated with the body in space and time, he became their muse. Even before the widespread adoption of technological advances in artistic practices, painters were incorporating aspects of \"movement of time\" into their works (e.g., futurists, Giacomo Balla, but also Marcel Duchamp ). \n\nAnother influential figure for artists was Eadweard Muybridge. In 1878 he photographed a racehorse at full speed, becoming the first to capture what looked like the actual, discrete sequence of motion. After devising the system of several cameras (12 for the first sequence he made), set in a row and arranged to go off in a sequence (with shutters released by pulled strings), he became fascinated with “secrets of time, secrets locked inside basic human movements – a leap, a splash, a walk […]”*. \n\nAll of this inspired me to create and capture algorithmically generated shapes, and record their subtle changes through time and space in the style of vintage scientific illustrations, film strips, long-exposure photos, and comic book panels. Each frame inside this view is one fraction of a second later than the previous one, and the whole frame view is slightly shifted. Your actions inside of the Passage will influence everything, from the number of rows and columns inside of the grid to the color palettes, shapes, and sizes of the objects.\n\n_____\n* Jad Abumrad (host) & Rebecca Solnet (author) say this when they talk about Muybridge in the episode Time, on the Radiolab podcast, aired Aug 24, 2010 (https://radiolab.org/episodes/91584-time)\n",

            "description": "'drawz' fxh_t019 is also vanilla javascript template for fxhash\n\n\nfeel free, to use (parts of) it, and learn from the source.\nand use it as a start for your own creative projects and adventures\n\nThis version has some extra routines you can use; \nand a lot of comments in the source\n\n\nA cleaned up - smaller version; just doing the basic tech screen & window-handeling etc. with just drawing dots can be found here.\n(and older and newer updated versions)\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\n\nMostly I start with a clean template; \nthen add: copy-paste routines into it. Things I want to use; sprites, text-font, filters, lines, 3D etc. \nLike kinda lego blocks. Some routines I re-use for 30 years now. \nAlthough often they have changed over time.\n\n\nVanilla javascript - And directly control your rgb buffer\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\ncons:\n- can be overwhelming for starting coders compared to p5js\n- you have to write / use and tinker with new drawing routines by yourself. \n- still can be optimized a lot, and run much faster\n-- (feel free to do that! - release new versions yourself)\n- I just coded it in Notepad++ and tested it in a browser.\n- I have no experience with git-hub, or those other nifty tools\n- I'm more an Artist than a coder, still learning new things as well.\n- I have my own 'old' coding style I picked up ages ago, and still use now and then. Started with basic and Z80a as a teenager.\n- for sure there are still some stupid bugs, spelling errors in it  ^___^\n\npros:\n- fxtemplate - fxpreview when done drawing / splash-screen support on top; while drawing.\n- do like 4000 x 4000 images on safari; on an old Iphone 5\n- just 1 index.html now - small file size: \n- the source of the 'cleaned-up' version is now 34b (not minified, and still comments in the source; can be even smaller)\n- direct control of the RGB buffer; every pixel.\n- I added some basic routines, like drawing points, lines, squares, sprite-brushes, filters, and my pixel-font\n- draw, add-mix or subtract - manipulate every pixel how you wish\n- I work with a big off-screen kind of image; a rgb-buffer; so drawing goes 'mucho' faster and render it to a screen-scaled image.\n- no other libraries used\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nMouse-click switches between:\n- screen scaled image\n- The large image \n\n- The work will refresh and restart after some time\n\nSave image - with s-key \n(includes the fxhash key-seed and num# of the follow-up images)\n--- It can take some seconds before the saving happens; \n--- the browser has to handle (very) large MB .png files first \n--- before it can save them \n\n- splash image support - to hide drawing at start\n- redraw the image after a while; or not.\n- mouse position check for the bigger image\n- fps counter for testing etc.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nwritten in vanilla JavaScript, more info in the source-code\n\n\ndrawz - latest or an updated version can be found at.\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\nIt would be nice; to include more routines into it\nin the future.\n\nAnd instead of 1 big library with everything in it\nI would like to have these templates; \nwhere you can add different little snippets and routines \nthat you want to use into it, and start playing next.\nStill learning new things as well. And getting inspired.\n\nI don't mind people to use the tech-source as a start for their own projects. \n\nBut the palette, and composition & structure build-up; is mine. \nDon't change just 1 or 2 -things then re-release it.\n\nIf you want to release something of your own,\nyour sketch and generative work; really should look total different!\nYou can use the technics to draw new things,\nbut you have to start from scratch again; \nchoosing points, lines etc. to play with and go from there.\nEnjoy! \n\n\n-for the love of Art and jumping in rain puddles-\n\n'like jimi and guitar'  0__.  ^____^\n\n\nxxx  amsterdam  chillout\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n",
