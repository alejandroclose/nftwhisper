            "description": "Some time ago I was looking for inspiration in my local bookstore. In the secondhand section, I found this incredible book called Grammar of Ornaments. It features ornamental patterns from all over the world. However, the page about Pompeian patterns really caught my attention. It was a composition of patterns taken from different mosaics. A patchwork of patterns that normally don't belong together, yet in this instance looked far more interesting than each pattern taken separately.\n\nSo it was decided, I was going to make a generative piece based on this visual. I used a couple patterns as a main reference and took them for a spin. After enough iterations, new patterns started to emerge. In the same time something occurred to me. What would the people, who made the reference I used, think of what I'm doing? If I'm lucky they would think it's visually pleasing. But chances are they'd think I made mistakes / faux pas.\n\nThis helped me come up with the name of the piece :  “Ornamental typo”. It’s a homage to the reference material (The grammar of ornaments) and the realisation that the final result may not be approved by the masters that came before me.\n\n\nFeatures (drop chance) : \n\n- Composition type (33%) : 3 types available ( Corner / Diagonal / Grid )  \n- Palette primary (3.8%) : 26 palettes available\n- Palette secondary (3.8%) : 26 palettes available\n- Monochrome (50%) :  whether the primary color palette match the secondary one or not \n- Condition (25%) :  4 conditions that simulate the effect of time on the piece ( Mint / Near mint / Used / Old )\n\n\nExport:\n\nClick on open live, then :\n-Press “1” to save as 2000*2000 jpg \n-Press “2” to save as 4000*4000 jpg\n\nFeel free to reach me if you need to save your piece in even higher resolutions",

            "description": "Looking at a motherboard seems like leaning over a busy city. Underneath the dense buildings (the components) runs at speed of electric fields an intricate transportation network that would drive any of our most practiced commuters crazy.\nDesigning circuit boards has been my job for a while. In addition to the technical approach I've come to deeply appreciate their aesthetical quality. The bond with generative art was striking to me.\n\nThe core code for \"Bright Circuits\" is a strict transcription of the rules at work when routing circuit tracks, i.e they can make 45° or 90° turns, they must respect a security gap between each other, and above all, they must never overlap. When the routing problem has no solution, we solve it by adding another layer of tracks, which communicates through soldered drill holes (Bright Circuits can have up to 3 layers).\n\nAt this point, the engineer in me got carried away by the art. As I was evolving from function to form, I started to imagine that the tracks where lifeforms driven by natural impulses, in an attempt to reach either freedom or a higher level of collective consciousness.\nDespite the advent of AI we know that something that still differentiates the human from the machine is the ability to both feel, and conceptualise the feeling ; the free will and the ability for undeterministic decisioning.\n\nCircuit tracks have managed to escape their boxed fate and arrange in shapes such as a circle, a heart, a skull (the components of a Vanity).\nThey now seek the experience of feeling. They have comprehended that feeling comes in a large palette of possibilities. Bright tracks are attracted to light (or positive moods), while dark tracks are running away from it (dark moods). The mix of both movements reflects the complexity of human feeling, which translates into a large variety of visual patterns.\nOccasionally, they will go as far as outpassing their fundamental electronics rules and display a breakthrough creative mindset through features called \"artistic rebellion\" and \"cartesian rebellion\". \"Bright Circuits\" will also communicate through a pair of human words their clumsy attempt at feeling and doubting.\n\n\n- press [s] in live view to export a PNG image file, between 9 and 8000 pixels wide.\n- press [enter] to stop the animation and go straight to the result\n\nCode in Vanilla Javascript + CSS\n\n10% of the royalties are for minters",

It has been designed to be viewed in 800x800, press ENTER to save a screenshot or ALT to save a 5x bigger picture.",

Who will collect the Zombie Cat eye?\n\n----\n\nCreated with the help of amazing cables.gl. For optimization purposes, in order to make the project load properly on fxhash, I had to use 2 textures for the eye pupil shapes instead of procedurally generating them.

            "description": "This experimental project involves an on-chain cellular automaton. The features and cellular automaton rules are derived from the minter's address. Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",

A little like a bird flapping its wings, each element moves on the canvas, leaving behind it the imprint of its passage.\n\nVariability of editions is ensured by:\n- 18 color palettes (including 4 rare)\n- possibility to combine 2 different palettes\n- Constrained directions of the field\n- Field symmetries\n- Speed, size and size variability of \"birds\"\n\n\nTo save as a png file, press the following keys:\n- [1] for a 2400x4000 pixel image\n- [2] for a 4800x8000 pixel image\n- [3] for a 7200x12000 pixel image\n\nThe image must be recalculated before the chosen dimension can be downloaded. The wait is worth it.\n\n\n\nNote regarding the symbolism of the series:\n\nI thought it was interesting to publish this series to celebrate the end of the fxhash beta. The artists on fxhash are like these birds leaving behind them the trace of their passage on the site. Their paths are sometimes parallel, they can cross and even sometimes come together to produce unique collaborations.\n\nThank you to all the artists and collectors for making the last few months an incredible journey! The best is still to come ...\n\nArtist: Estienne\nMarch 2022\nLicense: NFT 2.0",

The observer is invited to explore every detail, to immerse themselves in the intricacies of the scales, and to imagine the world behind this unique skin.\n\n'Dracorean Cryptic Scales' is a work that has transported me to a realm of fantasy and wonder, where nature itself becomes a work of art, and legendary creatures are unveiled through the power of artistic generation.\"\n\nTo change the density from 1 to 5 (incorrect results set to 1), double-click the left mouse button.\n\nI used p5.min.js\n\np.s.\nthe preview image may not match the job perfectly\n\nkisses\nKenzo da barra",
