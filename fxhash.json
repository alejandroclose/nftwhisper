            "description": "As a lifelong enthusiast of all things furry, I am continually captivated by the soft and luxurious feel of fur and the many forms it takes in the natural world. From wild animals velvety coats to the comfort of plush blankets and pillows, fur has a special quality that evokes warm and cozy feelings.\n\nFor many people, the touch of soft fur on their skin brings back memories of the safety and security of home. This sense of comfort can be especially powerful, providing a refuge from the turmoil and unpredictability of the outside world.\n\nWhether it is the shimmering pile of a top-quality carpet, the fluffiness of a cherished pet, or the stiff and rough fur of a bristly shepherd dog, the texture and appearance of fur is truly mesmerizing. It is not surprising that it has been a subject of human fascination throughout history and continues to be so even today.\n\nWith this project, I attempted to embody that cozy feeling by experimenting with various shapes and techniques while still maintaining a furry appearance.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\n\nThe generation of a hi-res image, up to 8.000x8.000 pixels, takes some time and you can see the drawing process happening in real-time.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters and pressing the following keys the artwork will regenerate at a different scale:\n\n- 1 -> 2.160x2.160\n- 2 -> 4.000x4.000\n- 3 -> 6.000x6.000\n- 4 -> 8.000x8.000\n\n=============> PROFILES <==============\n\nThere are 15 distinct profiles, each with varying levels of rarity:\n\nShattered -----> 18%\nInvalidated ---> 10%\nIntersect -----> 9%\nStrippy -------> 7.5%\nSweater -------> 6.5%\nSmally --------> 6.5%\nKasparov ------> 6.5%\nTriangle ------> 6%\nShell ---------> 6%\nMononoke ------> 6%\nSpiral --------> 4.5%\nSplatter ------> 4.5%\nSquiggle ------> 4%\nMcFly ---------> 3%\nKocinski ------> 2%\n\nThe \"Invalidated\" profile features a unique mode that can occur with a 7.7% chance, which includes blood marks as a tribute to a personal story that frequently came to mind during the development of this project.\n\nAs a child, I once snuck into the kitchen with the intention of stealing some Torrone while my mother was sleeping on the couch in the living room. I used a chair to reach the cupboard and was able to successfully obtain the sweet grail. I then grabbed a large knife to cut it, but while I was putting all my effort into cutting the hard candy, I failed to remove my left hand from under it. As a result, the blade sliced through the tip of my middle finger, causing me to start bleeding profusely. I ran to my mother, crying for help. When she woke up and saw me, she scolded me, saying: \"Move away from the carpet! You're ruining it with all that blood!\"\n\nI still bear a distinct line-shaped scar on my fingerprint today.\n\n=============> MAMIE <==============\n\nThis project is a tribute to my beloved grandmother Lucille, who recently passed away. Regrettably, I was unable to attend her funeral and I wanted to express my reverence for her wonderful spirit in this way. Her home in Blanquefort was abundant with soft and plushy surfaces, ranging from moquettes and carpets to stuffed toys and velvety cushions. As a child, it felt like the coziest place on earth.\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\n\nPowered by p5 and chroma.",
