            "description": "This piece features abstract patterns created using an algorithm I call QuadTubes.\n\nIt works by continuously stroking a set of quadratic curves that run through a set of points while rotating those points along a constant orbit.\n\nThis piece features 13 different arrangements and 11 different colors sets, so there should be around 20 pieces of each arrangement. Check the variations function to preview the different arrangements and styles.\n\nThe piece will slowly render and automatically pause after reaching its final form. You can press Space to Pause/Unpause the piece and let it run longer resulting in more saturated colors.\n\nYou can adjust the rendering speed with up/down-arrows or you can also load the page with\n'&Speed=*'\nat the end of the url to adjust the rendering speed (default = 25) and press S at any time to save an image of any state of the animation.\n \nInitial minters will receive 10% royalties.\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: \nThis piece was developed in and is best viewed in Chrome (100.0.4896.127). Moreover hardware acceleration needs to be enabled in the browser settings. There are still some browsers & devices that struggle with this piece, most notably iOS and Firefox. There is a fallback which is enabled in Firefox and iOS by default that works without hardware acceleration but produces notably different results in texture and color saturation (especially on iOS). You may force the fallback by appending \"&noHA=true\" to the url in live view and force the original rendering by appending \"&forceHA=true\" (Note you can combine multiple URL parameters with an \"&\", eg \"www.fxhash.xyz[...]?Speed=50&forceHA=true\").\n Please make sure that you have a device and browser capable of rendering this piece before minting.\n",
