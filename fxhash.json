The aesthetic is based on bubble chamber photography: the paths of particles are traced and photographed as they split and collide.\n\nThe primary particle travels at extreme speeds, looping around until it collides with another particle. The resulting explosion is traced out and interesting events are highlighted. Some of the particles shoot off at incredible velocity, and others spiral tighter and tighter until they blink out of existence.\n\nThis is a study in composition. \n\n ",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

This is a character who ironically, because of the many social culture shifts in his life, began to resort to the way of putting other people's faces and stories on himself. At first it was necessary to adapt in a certain circle of society so as not to be a black sheep, after a few years he stopped noticing how the consciousness itself uses the stories or phrases he has already heard from absolutely different people received during a conversation, news or other, another of the features is the numerous personalities of Steven.\n\nI am creating this project because I have long wanted to try to tell people that being yourself is the most difficult and wonderful feeling. My goal is to get an animated movie adaptation on Netflix, the script will be written by anyone who wants to participate in the community. \n\nPeace be with you all!",

            "description": "With 'Curtains,' I wanted to explore the concept of dying civilizations on distant worlds. Using p5js, I create collage-like images that resemble abandoned cityscapes on alien planets. The project is named 'Curtains' as it represents the final curtain call for these once-thriving societies. Through the use of painterly effects, I aimed to depict a sense of decay and loss in these apocalyptic landscapes while also leaving room for interpretation and imagination. \n\nThe project serves as a reminder of our own fragility as a civilization and raises questions about the fate of our planet and our future. Some may see it as a cautionary tale about the dangers of complacency and environmental neglect, while others may see it as a reflection on the cyclical nature of life and the inevitability of change.\n\nOptions:\n\n- press 's' to save the PNG image of the current view\n- press 'd' to save a high-resolution PNG image (can be slow 🐢)\n\nCreated using p5.js\nsteppe_walker, January 2023",

If our ‘soul’ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable?

            "description": "The series employs fractal circles to create repeating patterns, using a monochrome color palette on the canvas. The number, size, and density of circles as well as the level of recursion, vary across pieces. The introduction of these variations and arcs adds a new dimension to fractals by juxtaposing their self-similar nature at all scales with elements of randomness.\n\nThis is my third series in a row that features a monochromatic color palette. There's something about the limitation of using only binary colors that enables me to appreciate abstraction purely for its form.\n\nNote on the name: The series draws its name from Sayed Haider Raza of the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group. I have always admired Raza’s use of sacred geometry and his abstract work has forever been a source of inspiration. Raza believed that ‘Bindu’ (the dot, point or circle) is the ultimate point of creation, representing the universe in its entirety.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen. Press s to save an svg file.\n\nPixel Love!\n",
