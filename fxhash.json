            "description": "Our vision is to create meaningful generative artworks that express human sentiments about their social experiences.\n\nWe’re currently focused on experiences centered around celebration, and we’ve chosen a theme that connects people through music.\nMusic has the power to evoke a wide range of emotions within us, especially when experienced through a collective experience.\n\nWe wanted to generate an artistic script that visually captures these expressions. \n\nOur first music NFT collection reflects human sentiments towards Tomorrowland 2022. \nIt's a creative collaboration with dahleea, an artist dedicated to colors, who gave us the inspiration for the visuals you are seeing through one of her beautiful and colorful artworks.\n\nCoding, music, and art collide to recreate emotions expressed by people coming together from all over the world to share music and connection at one of the world’s leading music festivals. \n\nThe creative process:\n\nData was collected via emotion analysis using Twitter’s API. Our data is derived from emotion analysis models to extract the emotion scores (Happiness, Anger, Sadness, Fear, and Surprise) from 105,762 tweets, written in English, and containing mention of ‘Tomorrowland' between July 15, 2022, to August 8, 2022. \n\nOur analysis demonstrated the following emotions:\n\nHappiness: 38%\nAnger 8%\nSadness: 26%\nFear: 28%\n\nMusic:\n\nIn Pillars of Tomorrow, there are 4 instruments: bass, piano, percussion (hi-hat, kick, snare, claps, fx sounds), and a quiet pad. All the rhythms are self-written using Ableton, exported, and randomly selected to create the backbone of our generative music NFT.\n\nThis music piece has 4 different parts (basic, drop, break, after-drop) which are looped 3 times. All parts include different rhythm variations which are chosen randomly. \n\nThe generative harmony is present in the basic and after-drop parts. The key to generating harmony is using the emotion percentages above as possibilities for the next piano chord and melody to sound happy or sad.  \nWe chose to distort our bass sound according to anger trait values, as distortion can turn a mild bass into an aggressive one. \n\nFinally, there is also an emotion of surprise, which is associated with a special background and the sound of bells ringing.  The surprise element trait of the mints will be revealed after the Pillars of Tomorrow collection is fully minted.\n\nWe wanted to make a dynamic collection that would give you the feeling of a live music event, an interactive experience. A big stage flowing with music and diverse human expressions.\n\nc-camera start/stop\np pause (or play)\n\nspace (play/stop)\n\nl (change where the camera look)\n\nArrow Up (View pillars from above)\nArrow down (go to starting position)\nArrow left/right (camera moving direction)\n\nAWSD work as arrows as well\nscroll (Zoom In/Out)\n\nenter (screenshot)\n\nFor an optimal experience, we recommend using Google Chrome.\n\n#CodingIsArt\n\n",

Inspired by the early pioneering work of the concrete poets such as Dom Sylvester Houédard, Ian Hamilton Finley and Steve McCaffe, the project is a play with letters, words and graphic form in the computational and generative space.\n\nEach iteration gives you the possibility to discover a variety of visual form through exploring the system. Please explore your iteration with the key interactions below. It is hoped that you give the time to explore and observe. If you don't, you may end up with just a blank canvas. \n\nThank you for collecting. \n\nKey Interactions\n\n‘a’ activates forward motion on/off\n‘b’ activates backward motion on/off\n‘r’ rotates grid 45° [ rotates on key pressed]\n‘f’ rotates the grid freely [ stops on key release ]\n‘p’ switches grid scale on/off [ this can be CPU heavy on older machines ] \n‘g’ extra glyphs on/off\n‘q’ return to the initial state \n\n\nProgram written by Mark Webster\nFont is copyright ©simonrenaud\n\nareafour.xyz\n@motiondesign_01",

Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "I try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nI have always been interested in laying out patterns on the flat surface of the canvas and deciding how to cut and relate the frame to those elements on my design page. This focus is created through the influence of unpredictable handprints, batik prints, watercolors, and other oriental objects in my works. The desire for this decorative approach led me to cut the three-dimensional environment into a repeating flat pattern so that the rhythm of the shapes emphasizes the strong structure. Also, my attempt to use contrasting colors right next to each other - warm reds and oranges against great neutral greens, blues, and grays - is influenced by the challenging thinking of color and the lightness of impressionism in my work, where pure colors \"in a reflection in mind And the contrast makes them even more vivid. They are precisely like the works we enjoy in the real world of reflected light. They can be easily overlooked in the dull colors of a canvas or on a productive work page; these contrasts and complementary color silences side by side. , create a magnificent symphony of colors.\nI try to explore the unknown nature of objects in an emotional abstraction. Instead of imposing an entirely personal feeling on the canvas, I draw something out of the canvas with the tools of expressive abstraction and color contrast. The content of an abstract painting completely bypasses all those mental filters. Abstract painting is the revelation of the inner life of the human soul; it transforms from words to visual identity. The abstract painting speaks the language of the imaginary world, a language that struggles with complexities.\nThese types of art provide humanity with a background voice that profoundly soothes and heals our souls precisely because it is not figurative and, therefore, malleable and defined visually. An abstract painter seeks to depict the world around us in a way that is not what we see, but the message is that \"this is what the world feels like.\" An abstract work puts the viewer in a position to create an interactive experience with the art by giving them the freedom to say, \"this is for me.\"Looking at this work, we see pieces of colors and shapes you might imagine in a moment Gustav Klimt's Kiss, René Magritte's Golconde, etc. The ability of abstraction goes through the history of art and the human mind and remembers each one with hints.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of the royalty on each secondary sale.\nTwenty-two different color palettes and three different borders with random colors are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated September 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",
