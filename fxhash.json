The species diversity and the random stack of rocks, sands, fences and other objects are main structures I want to capture, in an abstract and planar style. \n\nMoreover, in this project, I also try to explore the representation ability of generative art. I select three elements: shape of entity, layout of palette, and stack of object location. The factors behind these elements are the balance of randomness and structure: the generative art generates the variants from randomness but restricts its chaos with structure (deterministic constraints) to represent the meaningful results. \n\nVariables:\n- 4 layouts\n- 6 texture patterns\n- 15 color palette\n- 3 randomness\n- 2 completeness\n\nPlease be patient with drawing process.",

            "description": "Another adventure in narrated horology: this work features entirely new texts, authored by AI that I trained on a set of novels. Each minute is an AI prose output, a fragment of a novel that doesn't exist, generated from the time itself.\n\nThe form factor is ideal for smaller window sizes and displays, although it will scale to any size. With the right device, you could probably wear it on your wrist.\n\nNearly 5,000 unique text templates are included, many of which feature variable character names, for which I sourced approximately 1.8 million possible first names and 150,000 possible surnames from U.S. Census data: https://github.com/rossgoodwin/american-names\n\nI wanted to provide just enough text for each minute so that you could read the whole excerpt before the minute ends, though you might need to read briskly. None of the passages have been edited manually, and some remain quite glitchy, as intended. You may recognize a few motifs or proper names here and there, depending on the books you're familiar with, but each passage remains wholly original otherwise.\n\nEach edition features either a linear or nonlinear text sequence:\n\nNonlinear editions will all show one of two possible template texts for each minute, and will read like fragments from multiple (strange and glitchy) novels. Nonlinear sequences feature independently generated texts, with variable character names unique to each minute of each edition.\n\nLinear editions will all show the same template text for each minute, and will read like (strange and glitchy) 24-hour novels. For linear sequences, I utilized a generative prompting technique in which each minute's text is generated partially from the text of the minute before it. Variable character names for linear sequences are unique to each edition and repeat throughout the day.\n\nAesthetic possibilities for each edition include 16 color palettes, 8 fonts, 7 depths, 5 types of numerals, and 3 types of hands. Some editions have color-accented second hands and minute marks, while others appear more static and minimalist, without any numerals or second hand at all.\n\nThis token relies on p5.js for the clockwork, vanilla JS for the text.\n\n\n\nDouble click to toggle fullscreen.\n\nPush `d` to download current minute's text as a .txt file.",

The artist is human, himself nature; part of nature within natural space.’ (Paul Klee, 1944) \n\n\nWorking on long-form nature has an interesting side effect. On the one hand, you're attempting a shallow imitation of a landscape.... You are working with cold logic and code, vainly trying to control randomness to create this virtual facsimile, something you know is artificial.... \n\n....and yet.... even with all this left-brain activity, your right-brain pushes back, and imagines being there. While working on this project I found myself continually daydreaming, wandering off to hear the sounds of waterfalls, or the crunch of walking along a sandy lake shore. If you've ever wondered about coding, I urge you to learn. Daydreams await....\n\n\nPress '1' once rendering is finished, to redraw at 5120x5120 resolution \nPress '2' to export without post-processing effects \n\n3rd party libraries (license text and links included in source) \n- p5.js - Creative coding framework \n- JS Topology Suite \"JSTS\", a port of Java Topology Suite \"JTS\" - High-level Geometry library \n- WebGLImageFilter, Dominic Szablewski - phoboslab.org \n\nI have tried to use soft blurs and shadows to give a sense of layering and depth to the scene. After viewing for a while, it reminds me of 3D paper-art.

            "description": "“Southern Gothic” is my debut release on the fxhash platform. The project is created entirely through code. All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n“Southern Gothic” borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",
