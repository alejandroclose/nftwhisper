            "description": "'Tesseract' is a generative collection drawing on the concept of the cube from oneirology, the interpretation of dreams. In many mythologies and fields of study, the square is considered a 'perfect shape', thus with its abstraction into three isometric dimensions, the cube is seen by some as a representation of the various aspects of the human condition.\n\nIn 'Tesseract', the ribbons flowing between the cubes represent the shared experiences that connect us all. No matter how different our lives might be, we all go through the same joys, sorrows, trials, tribulations and experience attachments of varying degrees. \n\nIt is these experiences that bind us together and make us who we are. With these concepts in mind, viewers are invited to interpret each composition as it relates to them and their unique story, from the perspective of that which has been and that which is yet to be experienced.\n\nPress 'S' to save a high resolution PNG at 2400 x 3396 px.",

            "description": "A Bézier curve is a type of curve defined by a set of control points. It can be thought of as a smooth curve that is pulled towards these control points, with the shape of the curve being determined by the positions of these control points. If the positions of the control points are changed in some way, the curve will alter to follow these changes.\n\nThis is a pencil-sketch version of my piece ‘Aurea’, and like that piece comprises multiple layers:\n\nThe main layer is a set of rippling Bézier curves, formed as the control points move along their own curves, traversing this path through a full rotation of the canvas. By plotting more than one of these curves, Moiré patterns emerge, further enhanced by altering stroke weights and line density as the piece progresses. Additionally, a pattern of on/off values is formed, of varying length, leading to a repeated pattern of gaps and lines.\n\nA second layer is added: beneath these curving, sinuous lines, points are plotted close to the limit of a circle, nearly filling the canvas. Its edges coincide with one of the points of the curves, producing an eclipsed planet; the lines seeming to dip behind its horizon.\n\nA third layer: a textured background, partially obscuring a plain-coloured canvas that forms the base of the piece.\n\nA final layer is two lines that move around or across each other, sometimes intertwining, sometimes parting. These lines follow the midpoints of the lines created in the first layer, shifting along the lines as the piece progresses.",

            "description": "\"Mythologic\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nMythologic is a project derived from cloud series, Cloud Atlas and Requiem: Cloud on fxhash. In the series, lines and circles are used in an organics movement like Cloud Hands, which is a move of Tai Chi. Practitioners move their hands slowly and smoothly, make circles and rotate with extreme concentrating. In Chinese we said “floating clouds and flowing water” to describe calligraphers’ freely flowing style of writing. Chi is a very important for oriental artists, and for genart as well. In the series, lines and circles start from one position to another, and develop with organic rotations and movements, like practicing Tai Chi on the canvas. \n\nMythologic was inspired from “Classic of Mountains and Seas”, also known as Shan Hai Jing, is a Chinese classic text and a compilation of mythic geography and beasts. \n\n“There is a beast that looks like a fox with nine tails.” \n“Huangbei: it is a beetle with meat like a tadpole, but with a head and a tail” \n“The beast has the body of a fish but the wings of a bird” \n\nThere are many incredible creatures in the text which describe the oriental fantasy. The idea of Mythologic is to present an illustrated handbook with random generated paintings, each one is like a framed badge, to memorize the glorious age. It uses the \"cloud hands\" technique in every parts of this piece, the center, the circle and the frame. They are all the same algorithm but perform variety with different density and components. Gold, Silver, Copper, Jade and Ruby colors as noble symbol of treasure in Chinese culture. \n\nThis project use p5js. \n\nPress 'S' to save pictures.\n\nThanks to the support of Yi-Wen Lin in this project.",
