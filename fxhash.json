These pigments are arranged in multiple layers, each layer using a different color from one of the carefully curated color palettes. Each palette consists of three to five colors. \n\nAs the pigments are shifted by random noise, new hues and patterns emerge, creating a lovely display of color and movement.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[5] to change the resolution.\n- Press [s] to save a png file at the current resolution.\n\nThis is my first generative art project. Created with p5js.\n\n________\n\nLooks best on high-resolution screens and viewed in live mode. When displayed on a low-resolution screen, an unintended moiré pattern may appear.",

            "description": "AERO\n\nIn the stillness of the void, floating cities hang suspended, bound by no earthly gravity. The buildings, wrought in shades of dreamy pastels, appear as though they have been plucked from some other time and place, and set adrift in a new and unknowable realm.\n\nHere, amidst the stillness and silence, ropes hang loosely like vines, connecting the structures in a delicate web of possibility. The architecture of the buildings is vaguely familiar, yet strangely surreal, hinting at a past now forgotten.\n\nAs the eye wanders through this landscape of suspended structures, a feeling of nostalgia begins to seep in. There is a sense that these cities were once inhabited, bustling with the energy of human life. Now, they stand alone, abandoned and forgotten, as nature slowly reclaims its territory.\n\n\n\nThe AERO series explores how a minimalistic set of shapes and rules can be extrapolated to create complex assemblies, the same way individual buildings will form villages and cities.\n\nTo add a sense of organic texture to these geometric structures, ropes that connect certain squares have been added. They can sometimes take on the appearance of vines. This addition aims creates a sense of tension between the man-made and the natural.\n\n\n\nDouble click or double tap to save the current image\n\nIn fullscreen mode / live view:\nAdd \"&size=xxxx\" at the end of the url to generate a custom sized image\nAdd \"&clean\" at the end of the url to remove the grain effect\n\n\nArtist: Estienne\nFeb. 2023\nLicense: NFT 2.0",

            "description": "Star Dance\n\nThis is a 100% generative animated project. Its creation was motivated by the beauty depicted in star trail photos that show the rotation of the earth relative to the stars using long exposures. What if the stars left trails like this on their own? What if they danced in intricate patterns?\n\nOne unique feature of this project is a slider that controls how abstract to render the output. It can vary from realistic starscapes to abstract geometric designs.\n\nStar Dance has 40 distinct movement patterns. Each edition gets a set of about 18 patterns that repeat in an irregular fashion until the animation is stopped. The mixing of a new movement pattern with the previous state of the stars yields intricate beautiful designs. The speed can be set to high for an energetic animation or to very slow for a subtle barely noticeable result. The speed and a couple of other settings can be controlled after minting using URL parameters.\n\nThe art will fill the available space and adapt to different aspect ratios.\n\nThe Params define most but not all of the qualities of each edition. The primary things that vary with the random seed are: 1) the specific motion patterns used and their order, 2) the number and positions of trees, 3) the details of some motion patterns (for example there are many different kinds of spirals used), 4) the exact color noise added to the colors defined in the params, 5) position and phase of the moon, 6) accent slashes in the sky.\n\nMost of the parameters are self-explanatory but here are a few things that are not obvious.\n\nThe alpha values for colors are ignored except for the moon and foreground. If they are set to alpha=0 then the moon and foreground do not get drawn.\n\nAbstraction values over 50 use fewer stars but they are drawn using the 'style' parameter which gives each star a more complex appearance. Abstraction values also impact the moon and foreground unless the 'abstraction for' parameter is set to 'stars only'\n\nCoherence controls how many of the stars follow a new movement pattern. At lower coherence values many of the stars will remain as they were after the previous pattern. This can leave visual echos of the previous patterns giving a more complex overall result. At coherence = 100 the stars will all follow the new pattern.\n\nThe theme pattern appears near the beginning and also appears more frequently than the others. Some patterns are less suitable for themes so there are 28 to choose from out of the complete set of 40. The preview image will be taken during the theme pattern.\n\nThe style only affects the star appearance for abstraction levels greater than 50.\n\nWhen the special setting is 'erode foreground' the foreground and moon will gradually dissolve.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis is a 100% code generated project. Outputs are created in using fx(params) but the speed, abstraction, and coherence properties can be adjusted using URL parameters.\n\nThere are some keyboard operations also\n\nClick on the output and use these keys to affect it:\n'f' - freeze/unfreeze\n's' - save a frame\n\nURL Parameters: To change the speed, abstraction, and coherence values add URL parameters like:\n?abstraction=80&speed=20&coherence=80\nThese values will override what was set at the time of minting.\n\nCopyright 2023 Jeff Clark\n--------------------------\n100% generative\n\nAll drawing and geometric code created by Jeff Clark using standard javascript and canvas 2D api.

            "description": "Toccata is a piece about decay, about the impermanent. The emergence over time or, rather, progression of entropy is a key characteristic of our universe. Everything evolves to nothing. We as mortal beings have sometimes trouble reconciling with this idea. Humans have sought immortality for millennia, be it through ancient potions or modern medicine, be it from leaving a legacy that we feel will stand the test of time. It will, only to decay later than us.\n\nToccata is a piece about change. Change lies at the heart of human cognition and human nature. Our thoughts and our emotions happen over time, and are a function of the change that is both around us and at the very core of our selves. Change comes in nature in cycles. Seasons of growth, seasons of ripe fruits of life, seasons of decay, of death, rebirth.\n\nToccata is music. We find music to convey some of the deepest streams of human condition, connecting it to some other form of being. Music also happens over time, and music happens because of change. Music encodes our feelings better than any other aid we may have. Toccata incorporates this at its very core, as the main sound is Andreas' family piano where he learned to play, sampled this past July.\n\nRead more about the piece, and the collaboration between Marcelo and Andreas on andreasrau.eu/toccata\n\n---\n\nBasic controls:\n- Click on the piece or press spacebar to start it (WebAudio requires user intervention for the music to start). Once the music has started, again click or press spacebar to play/pause.\n- Press “s” to save a still at the current resolution\n- Press “r” to start recording a video at the current resolution, then “r” again to stop.\n\n---\n\nWebM audio-video recording performed using the library RecordRTC by https://muazkhan.com/, MIT licence.",

            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "\"Garden, Monoliths\" is the result of an algorithm that started in April 2021. It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",
