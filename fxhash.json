Based on the simple, playful idea of wrapping a string across a board of pegs, it shows how endless possibilities can be achieved with just a basic set of rules and a few primary colors. When done right, generative art challenges us to answer fundamental questions around creativity, beauty, and life itself.\n",

Stylistically, it emulates realistic paper and ink using custom texture and line renderers. The piece will play through the duration of the hour, pause for five minutes, then begin anew.\n\n`one hour` was created for a physical installation, projected to a wall and animated in real time. By default it will render at high speed to reveal the preview. For the most immersive experience at home, it should be viewed in full screen and adjusted to real time speed (controlled via the number keys).\n\n||| controls\n\n[s] save as png\n[r] reset animation\n[l] toggle looping [default on]\n[1-5] adjust render speed\n[--1] real time (1 hour) [recommended]\n[--2] 6x (10 minutes)\n[--3] 60x (1 minute)\n[--4] 300x (12 seconds) [default]\n[--5] full speed",
