It is recommended that you view the work in 4K or 6K to appreciate the finer details. \n\nThe keyboard buttons: ‚Äú2‚Äù, ‚Äú4‚Äù, and ‚Äú6‚Äù can be pressed to change the resolution to 2K, 4K and 6K resolution accordingly. \n\nTo download an image at its current resolution, press the keyboard button ‚ÄúS‚Äù.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtwork created with p5.js\n\n@nbswwit\nSept 2022\n",

            "description": "\"Nature is the source of all true knowledge\".\n\nHave you ever taken the time to look, deeply look, at all the details in a humble patch of grass ?\n\nIn this tiny microcosm, a constant, fierce battle is going on, day after day, plants reaching out for sun, down for access to soil, fighting for survival. Smaller grasses form groups, alliances making it harder for taller ones to take over. Dead leaves remind us that some of them lost the fight, fallen warriors who, soon enough, will be forgotten too. Growth, decay, life, death, the endless cycle, right in front of our eyes.\n\nIt is fascinating, and, for me at least, an endless source of inspiration.\n\nIt is my hope that, through this project, you will take the time to take a closer look at nature, and that, as the pale blue dot we call home keeps getting drier and drier, remember that even humble patches of grass should not be taken for granted.\n\n\nKey commands:\n's' - save as png\n'b' - make the background transparent (for printing)\n'1', '2, '4' - set the pixel density, for resolutions up to 8000x8000\n\nThis updated version of the project should render on mobile devices, albeit with slightly reduced quality. \nIf you want to save the image for printing, I recommend you do so on desktop.\n",

But not quite.\n\nIt started from a square, that was cracked into many fragments. From outside, it is still a square, stable, reliable. From inside, it is a mess, with many experiences, each one being unique, each one with its own specificity.\n\nEven though we relate to others, there is no definition of normal. No one looks the same. This is why the palettes are all generated and there can be an infinity of them. Some have more darkness than others. Some are warmer, some are cooler. Some are a mix of many things.\n\nOur experiences and our cracks shape us. Sometimes following a natural flow. Sometimes following specific rules. But always guiding us as a whole.\n\n----\n\nThe day I started working on this piece, I realized that I often show myself as chill, ready to give a hand, ready to listen to others. But who am I to help others when I'm not sure about who I am or even what I am?\n\nMaybe that's why I'm able to relate. Because I have my own experiences that cracked me. And built me. So even if I'm a mess, even if I'm not sure about where I'm going, let's share and try to find out together.\n\n----\n\n- The images are meant to be viewed in an horizontal full screen but will adapt to any format\n- Click on the image to restart the animation\n- Hit \"S\" key or long tap on mobile in the live view to trigger an export\n- Add &width=5000 to the live view URL to render the image at 5000 pixels wide\n\n----\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienPradetArt",

Smaller grasses form groups, alliances making it harder for taller ones to take over. Dead leaves remind us that some of them lost the fight, fallen warriors who, soon enough, will be forgotten too. Growth, decay, life, death, the endless cycle, right in front of our eyes.\n\nIt is fascinating, and, for me at least, an endless source of inspiration.\n\nIt is my hope that, through this project, you will take the time to take a closer look at nature, and that, as the pale blue dot we call home keeps getting drier and drier, remember that even humble patches of grass should not be taken for granted.\n\n\nKey commands:\n's' - save as png\n'b' - make the background transparent (for printing)\n'1', '2, '4' - set the pixel density, for resolutions up to 8000x8000\n\nThis updated version of the project should render on mobile devices, albeit with slightly reduced quality. \nIf you want to save the image for printing, I recommend you do so on desktop.\n",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press ‚Äúe‚Äù to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press ‚Äúr‚Äù. Which one is the ‚Äúfinished‚Äù artwork? All of them. What is ‚Äúthe‚Äù artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: ‚Äúe‚Äù. To restore: ‚Äúr‚Äù\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing ‚Äúp‚Äù\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing ‚Äús‚Äù (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing ‚Äúd‚Äù followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press ‚Äúd 0‚Äù (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don‚Äôt know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press ‚Äúq‚Äù\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press ‚Äúv‚Äù followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press ‚Äúv‚Äù followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing ‚Äúo‚Äù. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodr√≠guez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

What does it mean to be stuck in one day? When everything around you is changing, living, breathing, dying, only you alone, like a stone statue. Nothing can touch you, and your feelings are externally muted to a minimum. Calm, joy, fear, anxiety, despair. You don't seem to have lost the ability to live, but you are somehow helpless and immobile. All your thoughts and experiences flow through your empty body, driving you insane. Everything around you distorts and changes in your eyes. And all you can do is remind yourself that it's just one long day. And I hope your tomorrow comes very soon. ",

But not quite.\n\nIt started from a square, that was cracked into many fragments. From outside, it is still a square, stable, reliable. From inside, it is a mess, with many experiences, each one being unique, each one with its own specificity.\n\nEven though we relate to others, there is no definition of normal. No one looks the same. This is why the palettes are all generated and there can be an infinity of them. Some have more darkness than others. Some are warmer, some are cooler. Some are a mix of many things.\n\nOur experiences and our cracks shape us. Sometimes following a natural flow. Sometimes following specific rules. But always guiding us as a whole.\n\n----\n\nThe day I started working on this piece, I realized that I often show myself as chill, ready to give a hand, ready to listen to others. But who am I to help others when I'm not sure about who I am or even what I am?\n\nMaybe that's why I'm able to relate. Because I have my own experiences that cracked me. And built me. So even if I'm a mess, even if I'm not sure about where I'm going, let's share and try to find out together.\n\n----\n\n- The images are meant to be viewed in an horizontal full screen but will adapt to any format\n- Click on the image to restart the animation\n- Hit \"S\" key or long tap on mobile in the live view to trigger an export\n- Add &width=5000 to the live view URL to render the image at 5000 pixels wide\n\n----\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienPradetArt",

            "description": "F√™lure is a piece picturing our inner selves.\n\nF√™lure means a crack in french. It can almost be pronounced as Failure. But not quite.\n\nIt started from a square, that was cracked into many fragments. From outside, it is still a square, stable, reliable. From inside, it is a mess, with many experiences, each one being unique, each one with its own specificity.\n\nEven though we relate to others, there is no definition of normal. No one looks the same. This is why the palettes are all generated and there can be an infinity of them. Some have more darkness than others. Some are warmer, some are cooler. Some are a mix of many things.\n\nOur experiences and our cracks shape us. Sometimes following a natural flow. Sometimes following specific rules. But always guiding us as a whole.\n\n----\n\nThe day I started working on this piece, I realized that I often show myself as chill, ready to give a hand, ready to listen to others. But who am I to help others when I'm not sure about who I am or even what I am?\n\nMaybe that's why I'm able to relate. Because I have my own experiences that cracked me. And built me. So even if I'm a mess, even if I'm not sure about where I'm going, let's share and try to find out together.\n\n----\n\n- The images are meant to be viewed in an horizontal full screen but will adapt to any format\n- Click on the image to restart the animation\n- Hit \"S\" key or long tap on mobile in the live view to trigger an export\n- Add &width=5000 to the live view URL to render the image at 5000 pixels wide\n\n----\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienPradetArt",

How we're all constantly on the go, whether that is physically, or mentally. Almost feeling like a monsoon. A storm of information. A storm of life. A storm of work. A storm of thoughts. A storm of emotions. A storm of everything. And it's all so fast.\n\nAs are the particles. They're all moving around these cyclones of information. Glowing up like neon signs in a busy city.

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works ‚Äì focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other‚Äôs work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them ‚Äì especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra‚Äôs use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work ‚Äì especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra‚Äôs compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me ‚ÄúMe as you ‚Äù (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor ‚ÄúMe as you as me‚Äù I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach‚Äôs work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, ‚ÄúMe as Me‚Äù has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh ‚Äìis it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave ‚Äì is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  ‚Äì\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes ‚Äì\nPress ‚Äúh‚Äù to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press ‚Äúm‚Äù to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and ‚Äúl‚Äù to reduce it. Use ‚Äús‚Äù to save the current resolution. \n\n",
