            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "Morixels Mega Colab #2 is the Second and one of the biggest Collaborations that happen on the FXHash and also in the NFT Community.\n\nIn this Collaboration, 24 artists plus I, have designed their artwork as pixel art. Each artist has 5 Artworks in this collection, which have been randomly combined with Borders that I designed (Morteza Yousefi, idea owner and art director)\nI designed the borders in such a way that by combining them, we find Unique borders that can be minimal or complex, or abstract.\n\nThis combination has got a beautiful effect in a random way, and besides that, this collection is very valuable because of the reputation and Ideas of the 25 artists and the Collaboration of 25 Artists.\n\nThe number of Traits in this collection is 7 (176 layers) and it has the ability to make 60,963,840 unique NFTs.\n\nTo create balance, these NFTs are randomly minted, and this is a chance for everyone to get a rare version. So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\n\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\n🟧🟦🟧🟧\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nMade in 2023\n\n🟧🟦🟧🟧\n\nCollaborators Twitter :\n@Morteza_Yousefy\n@ShagaONhan\n@PixeliusArt\n@ardavan_\n@Bonyvxl\n@mo0n_zi\n@Alireza_f_z\n@negar_khozhandi\n@MontazeriAmin\n@Gunnwik1\n@_iaM_Mina\n@mahdirezafathi\n@rishehri_h\n@ma_khalaji\n@Rezvan_jj\n@v_valimohammadi\n@nillgraphic\n@tsaibaba88\n@HeleDesignnft\n@iSteef\n@Raven_slb\n@marzieh_fazeli\n@borok_studio\n@ehsan_special\n@happyfamily1985\n\n",

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",
