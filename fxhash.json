            "description": "We’ve always known wallet addresses as strings of letters and numbers, Dry, soulless data, yet always present.\nBut what if this presence could breathe?\n\nIn the enhanced, living version of \"Season One\", we revisit that same idea, transforming the blockchain’s most essential elements into evolving pixelated lifeforms.\nEach artwork is still generated from the wallet address (`fxminter`) and the token’s hash (`fxhash`), but the project pulses with a new kind of energy this time.\n\n### What’s new in this evolved version:\n\n🕰 A Magical Clock\nA real-time clock has been embedded into the artwork. One that only ticks forward with each new mint.\nEach minted token captures a unique minute in time, held eternally by its collector.\nThis enchanted clock is not merely decorative. It holds a secret that will only be fully unveiled in \"Season Two\".\n\n🧩 A Fragment of the Bigger Picture\nAlongside the creature, every mint now receives a Roman numeral representing its mint number and a coordinate, marking its position in a hidden puzzle.\nEach token is a piece of a larger design; together, these fragments will reconstruct the gateway to the next season.\n\n🧬 Multiple Perspectives, One Identity\nThe core pixel creature, still generated uniquely from your wallet and hash, now appears in three views:\n\n* a breathing 2D form rendered in real time,\n* a puzzled isometric shape,\n* and a miniature preview of the final Season Two puzzle form, hinting at what’s to come.\n  Your identity is no longer shown from a single angle, it’s a multidimensional expression.\n\n🎨 Colors from the Hash, Signatures from the Wallet\nLike in the original version, all color palettes are derived directly from the hash. No two are alike.\nAnd, as always, your wallet address is subtly signed beneath the artwork, a permanent mark of authorship.\n\n---\n\nThis is not Season Two.\nThis is Season One: Alive, an evolved, living version of the original.\nIt preserves everything that made the first release special, but adds movement, time, spatial positioning, and hints of the next chapter.\n\nIf Season One was a spark, this version is its flame.\nOnly holders of these tokens will be able to step fully into Season Two and witness the transformation of their piece into its final narrative form.\nUntil then, this is your moment. Your pixel, your minute, your breath in the story.\n\nReptile 🦎\n----------\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "Schwere See\n(...which is german for \"Heavy Seas\")\n\nthis work creates completely generative ocean worlds between the real and the surreal.\nwhat is real? when do we feel reality? i guess as with many other things, we feel reality best when we're deprived of it.\nThat might be the reason why it never ceases to fascinate us to both exaggerate and abstract nature and reality - maybe even at the same time.\nthat's where this work tries to go...\ngiving my best to create realistic looking waves out of hmm... thin electron-gas..., and then disrupt those from realism by unnaturally exaggerating waveforms and abstracting the display to a few colors and lines - ...well, not so few of the latter, actually ;-)\n\nbeware: this needs a good GPU (at least here in 2023) to properly run in realtime.\nstills can still be rendered on a low end machine with on-board graphics, but for realtime playing you'd need some proper dedicated graphics card.\nand of course it wont run fast (or maybe not all) on your mobile phone (except maybe on a very high end device).\n\nthe different mints vary in wave shape, color, camera view, animation speed, aspect ratio, frame style, hatching density, field of view, and more.\nsome color schemes are based on pre-chosen palettes (slightly varied though), but others are wildly random-generated. there's always some risk in randomness, but lets give the error some chance to surprise us - this is one of the many benefits of generative art.\n\nas generative art can do so much more than just generate/show an image i feel almost obliged to add the possibility to animate/inteact.\nhowever, this extra control shall not be chosen without some considerations. \nyou don't want a strobingly wild animation above your fireplace or in a doctors waiting room. nor is it motion-wise very inspiring to have subtle image stills hanging in a dancefloor.\nso, by default when in animation mode (<space>-key) the scene is very slowly and steadily changing - some pieces faster, some slower. however, by pressing <f> you can toggle to a sped up animation of waves, clouds, and scene rotation.\nbtw, going faster in nav-mode also speeds up the wave animation. (...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

            "description": "White Mountain Winter is collaboration between myself and the machine to describe scenes that are real, or were. Yet perhaps now foreign, or out of time, or far away. I provide the seed of a dream I remember, and trust the machine to help make it real again.\n\nI grew up in a town much like some of these, homes dispersed throughout the valley beneath the shadows of the mountains rising around. This is a tribute to the memory of wintertime in that place; bleak, cold, grey, with the light seemingly always fading. Yet at the same time, the feeling of calm, solace, peace resonating through. Exposed to the mountain elements, yet protected by them. A delicate arrangement, but essential.\n\nThe seed of magic I remember is present in the experience of falling snow at dusk. Large flakes tumbling down and blanketing everything, no end in sight. The most striking thing is the silence. The fallen snow absorbing all distraction, insisting that your focus be sharpened to a singularity; right there, right then.\n\n---\n- Best rendered in Chrome browser (best performance, & canvas blur - please be patient :)\n- Made with p5js\n- Press \"s\" to save png",

            "description": "A collaboration between leading British high-end audio brand KEF, generative artist hieroglyphica, and creative studio Parameta, Absorbed embodies the process of noise becoming high-fidelity sound through KEF’s Metamaterial Absorption Technology (MAT™). \n\nMAT™ makes the KEF sound what it is: absorbing unwanted distortion to deliver pure, accurate sound exactly as the artist intended. Inspired by this intricacy, Absorbed illustrates pseudorandom networks of patterns, slowly emerging and transforming into the maze-like form of MAT™. Clarity is revealed, noise is absorbed – high-fidelity is found.\n\nThe noise fields used in Absorbed are of two distinct types: conventional gradient noise and “sinusoidal” noise, an original algorithm developed for this series. The use of animation as artistic medium reflects the artists’ belief that no single frame can capture the full range of complexity found in the tension between sound and noise, and lets collectors observe for themselves this ever-shifting dialogue. A more extensive discussion of the algorithms used in Absorbed can be found in hieroglyphica’s companion article on fx(text).\n\n- spacebar will pause and resume the animation\n- s will save a still image of the current frame\n- technically minded collectors can consult the index.html file for info on how to render and save high-resolution images\n- use of hardware acceleration in Chrome may impact performance\n\nFounded by BBC engineer Raymond Cooke in 1961, KEF is a leading British innovator of high-end audio products including HiFi speakers, subwoofers, architectural speakers, wireless speaker-systems, and headphones.

            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

            "description": "Polar Grid is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, London 2022.\n\nThis is a study of color, motion, and composition, and an homage to cinema as an artform. Colorful shapes overlap and pulse in a ever repeating dance. An abstracted movie experience. Each color palette in the series (except one) is inspired by a different film director (if you want a real challenge, see how many you can guess without looking at the feature names).\n\nThe palettes were extracted from movie stills or movie posters and fine tuned by hand. As often, I have to thank independent tool makers for their indirect help. My gratitude goes to David Aerne for FarbVélo and Fabrizio Bianchi for Coolors.\n\nThe code for Polar Grid is based on early iterations of what ultimately became my carat series. Both projects come from the same fascination for color as a system, even though I used a different approach here. You could call this a carat prequel.\n\nThe animation is done using a technique called polar noise. This makes it so the motion of all elements ends up repeating in the same amount of time. This is useful for generating motion that loops perfectly while still appearing organic. In this particular case, the animation repeats every π × 100 seconds.\n\nA challenge in building any generative system is to find the right balance between coherence and variety. I designed the system with the large edition size in mind. During development I generated hundreds of iterations and tweaked my code to make sure that every iteration is truly unique and fits the overall aesthetic of the collection.\n\nI truly hope you will enjoy your own little abstract movie.\n\n— Raphaël de Courville\n\n\nReleased: July 6th 2022\n\nMedium: p5.js, html canvas, css\n\nReference: sk220621\n\n\n**About the artist**\n\nRaphaël de Courville is a generative artist, streamer, and educator.
