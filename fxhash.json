            "description": "Graphic compositions made with simple elements. Playing with the subtlety and rhythm of colors, shapes and textures.\n\nThis work was inspired by the textures of monotype prints and those of metal engraving. Especially in the geometric marks made by the inking roller while stretching the graphic ink to make a manual printing. It is a tribute to the visuality of handmade prints.\n\n\"Monotipia\" means monotype printing in Portuguese. It is a graphic printing process that results in a single copy. Here I make a parallel between monotype printing and the code+hash minting process, which also produces a single image.\n\n---\nFeatures:\n-> 15 composition schemes\n-> 51 handpicked base colors\n-> 3 canvas formats:  \n-----> Portrait (vertical) \n-----> Square \n-----> Landscape (horizontal)\n-> 3 element tones options: \n-----> Light Texture & Shapes\n-----> Light Texture / Dark Shapes \n-----> Dark Texture & Shapes\n\n---\nTo save the image as a png file, type:\n[1] save at actual size \n[2] save with 2000px height\n[3] save with 3000px height\n[4] save with 4000px height\n[5] save with 5000px height\n\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n---\nCreated with p5.js\n\n---\nThis is my first project on FX(hash) and I would like to express my special thanks to Janaina Selva, Dmarchi, Gyo and Morbeck for their support and for following the step-by-step development of this work, always contributing with a critical eye and great suggestions. I also thank the help from the FX(hash) community on Discord.\n\n---\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2023\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada",

            "description": "Graphic compositions made with simple elements. Playing with the subtlety and rhythm of colors, shapes and textures.\n\nThis work was inspired by the textures of monotype prints and those of metal engraving. Especially in the geometric marks made by the inking roller while stretching the graphic ink to make a manual printing. It is a tribute to the visuality of handmade prints.\n\n\"Monotipia\" means monotype printing in Portuguese. It is a graphic printing process that results in a single copy. Here I make a parallel between monotype printing and the code+hash minting process, which also produces a single image.\n\n---\nFeatures:\n-> 15 composition schemes\n-> 51 handpicked base colors\n-> 3 canvas formats:  \n-----> Portrait (vertical) \n-----> Square \n-----> Landscape (horizontal)\n-> 3 element tones options: \n-----> Light Texture & Shapes\n-----> Light Texture / Dark Shapes \n-----> Dark Texture & Shapes\n\n---\nTo save the image as a png file, type:\n[1] save at actual size \n[2] save with 2000px height\n[3] save with 3000px height\n[4] save with 4000px height\n[5] save with 5000px height\n\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n---\nCreated with p5.js\n\n---\nThis is my first project on FX(hash) and I would like to express my special thanks to Janaina Selva, Dmarchi, Gyo and Morbeck for their support and for following the step-by-step development of this work, always contributing with a critical eye and great suggestions. I also thank the help from the FX(hash) community on Discord.\n\n---\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2023\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada",
