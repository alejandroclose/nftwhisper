We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "\n\"Polako\" means \"slowly\" in Montenegrin. When I first came here, the word I heard most often when I wanted to do something with someone or ask them for something was \"Polako.\" In the culture I grew up in, everything happened very quickly and was results-oriented. In my new city, it's the opposite. Things may move slowly, requiring patience, but the aim is for better results. Perhaps they're right; the longevity of quickly done things is debatable. Our contemporary culture is like that too, everything is based on consumption. Art fields are also affected by this trend. Many artists or works without a past become popular with instant attention and then disappear after a while. This is sad in the long run. But when artists who don't get the recognition they deserve face these situations, they question themselves and their art, feeling inadequate and unsuccessful. As someone who has experienced this a lot, I am a keen observer. But speed is not necessary. What's important is to be lasting. Yes, this is very difficult. It's really hard to endure life and make your production sustainable. I must be patient. I need to mature my ideas. Slower, more polako. Surely, our art will be appreciated. There is a hidden connection between slowness and faith.\n\nIn this collection, I have returned to my architectural world once again. I have designed new compositions for depth. I moved away from colors and focused on textures. I tried to draw attention to changing animations in the background and spontaneously formed pixel layouts in the foreground.\n\n*Start and stop animation: press 'Q'\n*Save image: press 'W' to save the current image as a PNG.\n*Fullscreen mode: press 'E'\n----------------------------------------------------------\nPolako © 2024 by NUBPLUS is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 ",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution. I tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge / Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iPhone, but please make sure it works on your device before minting.\n\n-----\n\nPossible features:\n\ncolor scheme: cairngorm, alborz, bardenas, atlas, bieszczady, watkins\n\nproportions: square, wide, standard, narrow\n\nframe: none, vignette, bright, dark, bright with vignette, dark with vignette\n\nvisitors: tourists, tourists and birds, solitary flock of birds, only light\n",
