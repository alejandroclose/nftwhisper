            "description": "Hyper Drive is based on the mathematics of recursion. Scale symmetry is used to create patterns that repeat at ever-smaller intervals, creating the illusion of infinite depth and complexity.\n\nThe rule for the recursive loop is incredibly simple. A box is drawn, then a snapshot of the full canvas is resized to cover the boundary. As this process is repeated, small variations in position create endless fractals.\n\nThis project is an experimental cross-chain collection, with a fully-generative A-side published via Art Blocks on Ethereum and an AI-based image composition B-side published via fxhash on Tezos. The artwork symbolizes the great divides we must cross, the connections we make along the way, and the disconnections we feel. We move through the world as the world moves through us.",

            "description": "Cellular automata is fascinating :) Applications ranging from physics and biology to modeling and architecture, with artistic and aesthetic representation always following along. Perfect example for emergence, how simple even byte-size rules result in complex structures, forming patterns and unpredictable behaviors...\n\nThis one is simple, 1d elementary cellular automata and the 256 rules as the foundation, where each iteration consists of the following elements: base rules - 3 are selected and allocated into the start row compositions, a set of shapes is assigned to a grid of various sizes. Occasionally, dynamic rule set is added - where a rule is randomly transformed into another random rule on a random row of the grid. A vertical or horizontal alignment of the grid is chosen an a color set assigned. Sometimes, a simple 2d noise is applied to lighten (or well, darken) things a bit. The grid is finite and confined by the amount of cells in a row and amount of rows fitting the canvas given cell size.\n\nThe properties are recorded as features, more as a reference to the building blocks, rather then rarity indication. Probably be best viewed in live mode :)\n\nPressing 's' in live mode will save the png of the output.",

            "description": "Bone Work (Gulf of Mexico) 2022 centres on sixteen fragments of dead coral found by the artist on the shores of the Yucatán Peninsula on the Gulf Of Mexico. Collected and 3D scanned the titular ‘bones’ in the work consist of corals which have perished from exposure to ocean heating from climate change, agricultural nitrogen runoff from the American midwest or local pollution, or a combination of all three.\n\nFloating above a virtual representation of the Gulf the bones are re-positioned in each edition using fxhash to generate different outputs. The public can rearrange the bones by clicking and dragging upon them on a desktop or hand held device. Dragging in the background allows one to look around the floating sculpture. On reload the new arrangement is lost and the original configuration returns. The work slowly turns in space however this can be switched off using the R command on a desktop device.\n\nThe work operates on local Yucatán time (GMT-5) and is an annual solar simulation. The sun rises on the world of the work simultaneously as in Mexico and sets accordingly to show dusk and night. Thus the work can look radically different from each hour to the next across the year. One will witness long days in the summer and short in winter - accurate across the solar year.\n\nBone Work (Gulf of Mexico) 2022 extends John Gerrard's twenty year engagement with simulation as a contemporary art form and further develops ecological themes as seen in Dust Storm (Dalhart, Texas) 2008, Western Flag (Spindletop, Texas) 2017 + more recently Flare (Oceania) 2022 - seen at the artist debut at Pace Gallery, New York in Summer 2022 and originally premiered by Art of Change 21 at the UN Climate Change Conference / COP26 Glasgow at the University of Glasgow / Hunterian Gallery.\n\nBone Work (Gulf of Mexico) 2022 is John Gerrard’s first work on the Tezos blockchain and his first project on fxhash.\n\n20% of proceeds from this project are dedicated equally to support The Herbert Franke Archive at ZKM via https://www.tribute-hwf.com and to regenerate.farm, the artists fund to support creative regenerative agricultural projects globally.\n\nBone Work (Gulf of Mexico) 2022\nEdition of 365 Unique Generative Worlds\n(If not sold out one work to be burnt each day until the edition is closed out. Works are typically burnt once a week by the artist on a Monday x 7 works)\n\nCredits\nProducer : Werner Poetzelberger\nProgrammer : Helmut Bressler\nEngine : WebGL\n",

By exploring the juxtaposition of depth and flatness, abstraction and figuration, shadow and brightness, this collection encourages us to confront and overcome the parts of ourselves that we may not want to face, but ultimately need to for our growth and healing.",

            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

            "description": "\"Rangxel\" is part of the live outdoor art installation - 'Computational Convergence' at India Art Fair, held from 9-12 February 2023 in New Delhi. \n\nRangxel is an interpretation of traditional Rangoli formations as tesseracts, combined to form monolithic structures. \n\nRangoli is a traditional artform that originated in India and is typically created during rituals and festivals like Diwali. It involves drawing intricate designs, typically on the floor, using materials such as colored powders, flowers, and grains. \n\nRangoli is meant to bring prosperity and happiness to a home and can range from simple geometric patterns to more complex depictions of nature.\n\nThe Rangxel tesseracts are created through rule-based instructions, following traditional Rangoli formation principles like symmetry, repeating patterns, and themes, resulting in interconnected, multi-dimensional forms of fragments.\n\nThese monolithic structures also reflect natural 3D grids found in nature such as crystals and honeycombs,presenting a deconstructed, pixelated matrix of our universe. \n\nUltimately, the reality we live in is an abstraction of the algorithm narrated by the creator.\n\n#StayPixelated\n\nControls (){\nDouble click Once to Enable Rotate around Tesseract;\nDouble click Twice to Disable  Rotate;\nDouble click Thrice to Go back original Composition;\nRotate , Zoom , Pan with Touch/Mouse;\n}\n",

The work depicts a cityscape at night, with the warm glow of streetlights and windows reflecting on the calm waters below. The moon casts a silvery light across the scene, imbuing the city with a magical quality that is both captivating and enchanting.\n\nIn the foreground of the work, a delicate paper boat floats on the sea, a symbol of innocence and childlike wonder. Its fragile presence in the vast expanse of the sea highlights the endless possibilities of exploration and the hope that accompanies the embarking of a new journey. Even the smallest vessel can set out on a journey of discovery.\n\nNocturne is a work that encourages us to slow down, breathe, and take in the beauty of the world around us. Invites us to immerse ourselves in a world of wonder and imagination that captures the beauty of the night and the magic of the city, at the darkest of times, where there is always a glimmer of light and hope to be found.\n\nNocturne's color palette is limited to blues, purples, browns, and greens, evoking the moody and atmospheric quality of the night.\n\nMoon Phase: Fool Moon, Waxing Crescent Moon\nBuildings: Apartment buildings with TV antennas, Gable roofs with chimneys\nStreet Lights: Globe, Modern\n\n100% code.\n\nPress [s] to save a PNG file with a minimum resolution of 4000px.",

            "description": "\"Days of Solar Wind\" generates an image for each day of the year 2022 based on the speed of the solar wind on that particular day.\n\nSolar wind is hitting earth constantly. It is invisible but exists. Everyday with a different strength and speed.\n\nThe data used were collected by the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) mission.\n\nThe solar wind is a continuous stream of protons and electrons from the sun's outermost atmosphere — the corona. The interaction of solar wind with the Earth's atmosphere can result in the aurora borealis and aurora australis, which are glowing aurora displays above the polar regions.\n\nPress [s] to save a 4000x4000px PNG file.",

            "description": "Eorisis is a generative artwork created by the movement of 1000 double pendulums. \n\nA double pendulum is a chaotic and complex system that generates a unique pattern with each swing. The lines vary in width and darkness, depending on the speed and amplitude of each pendulum's swing. The resulting drawn image is dense, visually striking, and sensitive to initial conditions, representing the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the system.\n\nThe complex and unpredictable nature of these images inspires feelings of awe and wonder as we attempt to comprehend the intricate patterns created by the pendulums. The image's dense and complex nature captures the observer's attention in an effort to understand the mathematical and physical principles behind the movement of the pendulums. At the same time, the repetitive and rhythmic movement of the pendulums in a seemingly effortless manner creates a calm and serene landscape.\n\nDuring the creation of the image we only see twenty of the one thousand double pendulums. \n\nEorisis (αιώρησις) in greek means swing; the periodic motion of a body whose orbit is a circular arc.\n\nWait for the progress bar to complete at the bottom of the canvas.\n\nAfter the render is completed, press [s] to save a 4000x4000px PNG file.",
