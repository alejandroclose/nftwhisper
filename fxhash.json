            "description": "Errance - an exploration of abstract and digital glitch fusion. The algorithm crafts the concept and structure, while randomness navigates the detailed textures, exploring the interplay between systematic design and the unforeseen aspects of randomness. Errance represents a journey of discovery, one without a defined endpoint, capturing the unexpected and fortuitous outcomes that emerge as algorithms navigate freely, leaving a trail of unique and unpredictable patterns.\n\nBest experienced in live mode at high resolution, the outputs vary significantly due to multiple features, occasionally favouring a slightly asymmetric balance. Under the hood, the algorithm employs a combination of recursive functions, 3D primitives, and multiple textures derived from trigonometric and noise functions using p5.js. Last but not least, during rendering, the outputs are enhanced by one of several versions of a GLSL shader.\n\nIn live mode:\n-press 1 to save a 2K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 2 for a 4K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 3 to render a version without passepartout.\n-press 4 for a 2k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.\n-press 5 for a 4k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.",

            "description": "Errance - an exploration of abstract and digital glitch fusion. The algorithm crafts the concept and structure, while randomness navigates the detailed textures, exploring the interplay between systematic design and the unforeseen aspects of randomness. Errance represents a journey of discovery, one without a defined endpoint, capturing the unexpected and fortuitous outcomes that emerge as algorithms navigate freely, leaving a trail of unique and unpredictable patterns.\n\nBest experienced in live mode at high resolution, the outputs vary significantly due to multiple features, occasionally favouring a slightly asymmetric balance. Under the hood, the algorithm employs a combination of recursive functions, 3D primitives, and multiple textures derived from trigonometric and noise functions using p5.js. Last but not least, during rendering, the outputs are enhanced by one of several versions of a GLSL shader.\n\nIn live mode:\n-press 1 to save a 2K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 2 for a 4K-resolution PNG copy.\n-press 3 to render a version without passepartout.\n-press 4 for a 2k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.\n-press 5 for a 4k-resolution PNG copy without passepartout.",
