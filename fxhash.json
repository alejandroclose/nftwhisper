            "description": "Bardez is the Armenian word for garden. It is etymologically tied to an ancient word for paradise, but that link goes deeper than etymology. Gardens have always been small pieces of paradise for me, and hearing the word in Armenian triggers a flood of warm memories.\n\nMemories of wandering around my grandfather’s garden, plucking ripe plums and figs from their branches.\nMemories of playing in my parents yard, the scent of jasmine in the summer heat.\nOf sun warmed tomatoes in my mom’s vegetable patch.\nThe smell of dirt and grass.\nMud on my hands.\nSun on my skin.\nMemories of paradise.\n\nI hope you enjoy these gardens I’ve planted, and I hope they remind you of some warm and wonderful memories.\n \nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n - This piece uses a shader to compute the lighting of the terrain in the first frame. If you don’t have a graphics card, you may have difficulty running this.\n\n - Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you the progress of the render, and also show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.\n\n - Finally, collectors at the highest tier will be entitled to a signed print of their edition. For further details and updates, keep an eye on my Twitter (@_NatSarkissian).\n",

            "description": "A single seed shape is chosen from 13, and placed onto the plane. At every step, a copy of this seed is laid edge-to-edge adjacent to an existing shape, without causing any overlaps. This copy is colored based on the edge it shares with the existing shape. The process continues until the animation completes.\n\nNew shapes are placed closest to a moving target. In some mints, this target is slow moving, causing new shapes to expand radially from the seed. In other mints, this target races around, causing new shapes to chase it. \n\nEach of the 13 shapes forms different patterns under different circumstances. Not all patterns will be explored.\n\nControls:\n  - SPACE: Pause/unpause the animation.\n  - ENTER: Skip the animation.\n  - R: Restart the animation.\n\nURL Params:\n  - \"preview=1\": Skip the animation.\n  - \"flex=1\": Adapt the boundaries to the size of the window.\n  - “slow=1”: Draw only one shape per frame.\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "fx(elevate) is a cry for parity within our community for underrepresented groups. It is released in conjunction with fx(fam) 003, our third community town hall.  Like all my 2023 releases, previous collectors of my work may collect it for free. In fact, anyone may collect it for free.  But, there is a catch.  This is not intended as a fleeting show of generic support.  It’s a personal challenge.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to elevate the artist named in your edition. Here is how it works.  Collect an edition and watch your new piece of art build.  Open it in live mode and press R.  The name of an artist will appear.  This the artist you are asked to elevate.  The artist names are from the two lists found on fxfeed.xyz: “women in genart” & “lgbtqia2s+ in genart” (see full list below).  The names themselves are fx(hash) user names, facilitating easy location of their work.\n\nHow do you elevate? Here are some ideas:\n. Explore the artist’s work, commit their name to memory, and watch for opportunities to support them\n. Follow the artist on fxfeed and social media\n. Post about and engage in discussions about the artist’s work on social media\n. Take every opportunity to ask that the artist be included in events, panel discussions, podcasts, curated exhibits, newsletters, etc.\n. Collect the artist’s work if you have the means\n. List the work you’ve collected and help build the secondary market for the artist\n. Explore fx(elevate) editions collected by others, commit the names of those artists to memory, elevate them, repeat.\n\nIf we draw attention to, and train our influence on, these important members of the fx(family), we will be the change!\n\nThe other major feature of the work is the palette.  There are twelve choices, exposed as a feature, and each one is associated with an aspirational characteristic of our community.  You can take up the challenge of emphasizing this characteristic in yet another way of elevating our shared goal.\n\nThis work could not have been completed without the support of the fx team and two wonderful members of our fx(hash) community, cari ann shim sham* and louis. My undying love and respect always. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in April, 2023.\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [R] in live mode to reveal the name of an artist to elevate.\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution file suitable for printing.

            "description": "fx(elevate) is a cry for parity within our community for underrepresented groups. It is released in conjunction with fx(fam) 003, our third community town hall.  Like all my 2023 releases, previous collectors of my work may collect it for free. In fact, anyone may collect it for free.  But, there is a catch.  This is not intended as a fleeting show of generic support.  It’s a personal challenge.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to elevate the artist named in your edition. Here is how it works.  Collect an edition and watch your new piece of art build.  Open it in live mode and press R.  The name of an artist will appear.  This the artist you are asked to elevate.  The artist names are from the two lists found on fxfeed.xyz: “women in genart” & “lgbtqia2s+ in genart” (see full list below).  The names themselves are fx(hash) user names, facilitating easy location of their work.\n\nHow do you elevate? Here are some ideas:\n. Explore the artist’s work, commit their name to memory, and watch for opportunities to support them\n. Follow the artist on fxfeed and social media\n. Post about and engage in discussions about the artist’s work on social media\n. Take every opportunity to ask that the artist be included in events, panel discussions, podcasts, curated exhibits, newsletters, etc.\n. Collect the artist’s work if you have the means\n. List the work you’ve collected and help build the secondary market for the artist\n. Explore fx(elevate) editions collected by others, commit the names of those artists to memory, elevate them, repeat.\n\nIf we draw attention to, and train our influence on, these important members of the fx(family), we will be the change!\n\nThe other major feature of the work is the palette.  There are twelve choices, exposed as a feature, and each one is associated with an aspirational characteristic of our community.  You can take up the challenge of emphasizing this characteristic in yet another way of elevating our shared goal.\n\nThis work could not have been completed without the support of the fx team and two wonderful members of our fx(hash) community, cari ann shim sham* and louis. My undying love and respect always. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in April, 2023.\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [R] in live mode to reveal the name of an artist to elevate.\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution file suitable for printing. It can take a bit - please be patient.\n\nArtists:\n0rfula, Ada Ada Ada, Aeon Bloom, Aleksandra, AliaK, Ally, Alyssa Joines, Amanda Homem, Amber Vittoria, Amelia, Amy Goodchild, Ana Maria Caballero, Anna Lucia, Anna Carreras, aster1ai, Atelie 407.genart, aether, auniseiva, AutoEclectus, AydaEtb, Babara Ramos, Bandana, candevicmo, cari ann shim sham*, Casekimba, Cathy Burghi, catnips, Ce Vignolo, ChistAi, Ciput_GENART, crystalspaceshp, danielleking.tez, daratan, DehiscenceArt, DesignwithSarah, Devi Parikh, Dora Vlady, drawsbymv, Eliza SJ, ella, Elout de Kok, elsif, Emily Xie, Empress Trash, Estelle Flores, ExperiMentalnoise, Fabi Yamada, Faze, flight404, goldcat, Gyo, Henames.art, INA VARE, innadakota, IskraVelitchkova, Iteration__, Ivona Tau, jeres, jesshewitt, Jimena Buena Vida, Jojo Sunshine, Jolie Michel, jsliang, Julia V, krolcm, Kunio Okuizumi, Kusamehewa, la.agust, LadyTezos, levoontin.tez, Liam Egan, liasomething, linxirwengi, Lisa Orth, Lisa Sekaida, m5alien, mandybrigwell, mare-mon, Mariana JU, Medusa Iro, Melissa Wiederrecht, Minever, MinooK, nx0, Nadieh, Natalie.J, Negarnaderifard, NftEconomist, Nicole Vella, orbitanaut, Pixantle, QianqianYe, RalenArc, reona396, Reva, Rezva, sapirco, Sarah Ridgley, Sasha Stiles, se.nao.maja, Selisse, senbaku, sharla, Sollevera, sonylemon.tez, speginel, Stefj, SuLuLab, TAN-TAN, thesarahshow, trp_chai, Tyche, UBERMORGEN, V5MT, Victoria Crux, VidaV, violetforest, vocesferales, Wanda Oliver, Willow Pines, WizArtOfTez, Yasmin Senzi, Ziggo511.",

            "description": "This project was started in December 2021. At that time, I didn't know what the result would be. It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

            "description": "fx(elevate) is a cry for parity within our community for underrepresented groups. It is released in conjunction with fx(fam) 003, our third community town hall.  Like all my 2023 releases, previous collectors of my work may collect it for free. In fact, anyone may collect it for free.  But, there is a catch.  This is not intended as a fleeting show of generic support.  It’s a personal challenge.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to elevate the artist named in your edition. Here is how it works.  Collect an edition and watch your new piece of art build.  Open it in live mode and press R.  The name of an artist will appear.  This the artist you are asked to elevate.  The artist names are from the two lists found on fxfeed.xyz: “women in genart” & “lgbtqia2s+ in genart” (see full list below).  The names themselves are fx(hash) user names, facilitating easy location of their work.\n\nHow do you elevate? Here are some ideas:\n. Explore the artist’s work, commit their name to memory, and watch for opportunities to support them\n. Follow the artist on fxfeed and social media\n. Post about and engage in discussions about the artist’s work on social media\n. Take every opportunity to ask that the artist be included in events, panel discussions, podcasts, curated exhibits, newsletters, etc.\n. Collect the artist’s work if you have the means\n. List the work you’ve collected and help build the secondary market for the artist\n. Explore fx(elevate) editions collected by others, commit the names of those artists to memory, elevate them, repeat.\n\nIf we draw attention to, and train our influence on, these important members of the fx(family), we will be the change!\n\nThe other major feature of the work is the palette.  There are twelve choices, exposed as a feature, and each one is associated with an aspirational characteristic of our community.  You can take up the challenge of emphasizing this characteristic in yet another way of elevating our shared goal.\n\nThis work could not have been completed without the support of the fx team and two wonderful members of our fx(hash) community, cari ann shim sham* and louis. My undying love and respect always. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in April, 2023.\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [R] in live mode to reveal the name of an artist to elevate.\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution file suitable for printing.
