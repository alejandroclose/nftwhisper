            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

What does it mean to be stuck in one day? When everything around you is changing, living, breathing, dying, only you alone, like a stone statue. Nothing can touch you, and your feelings are externally muted to a minimum. Calm, joy, fear, anxiety, despair. You don't seem to have lost the ability to live, but you are somehow helpless and immobile. All your thoughts and experiences flow through your empty body, driving you insane. Everything around you distorts and changes in your eyes. And all you can do is remind yourself that it's just one long day. And I hope your tomorrow comes very soon. ",

What does it mean to be stuck in one day? When everything around you is changing, living, breathing, dying, only you alone, like a stone statue. Nothing can touch you, and your feelings are externally muted to a minimum. Calm, joy, fear, anxiety, despair. You don't seem to have lost the ability to live, but you are somehow helpless and immobile. All your thoughts and experiences flow through your empty body, driving you insane. Everything around you distorts and changes in your eyes. And all you can do is remind yourself that it's just one long day. And I hope your tomorrow comes very soon. ",

How can we tell one from the other, such as natural from natural, if they look the same or perform the same functions?\nI was inspired to create branches by the news of the development of mechanical trees that can capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. These cyborgs are able to do the job much more efficiently than their natural counterparts. Soon there will be an entire forest of mechanical plants in Arizona.\nThe mechanical trunks are tall columns, 1.5 metres in diameter, which are made up of discs, just like the stem of the mechanical-digital branch in this work. It is capable of twisting and taking a variety of forms, from entirely natural to more angular, industrial, mechanistic ones. Where does the fine line between our recognition of a living organism and an artificial one pass, does it exist and will it be important to us in the future?\n\nThe palettes are taken from Japanese prints celebrating the beauty of nature.\nPlus there is a vaporwave palette that reminds me of the game Metal Mutant, the aesthetics of which I was fascinated with as a child.\n\nMade with p5.js code\nTo save the image, press the 's' key. Enjoy!\n\nSeptember, 2022\nJulia V & YulikolaY",

But notice; often porous, it's also a locus. \nLocus of millions of very tiny lines, one bit and one layer at a time connecting many dots. Different species of Cellular Automata (studied by John von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam, Stephen Wolfram, and John Horton Conway) the surface hosts. The little cells interact with their neighbors following simple rules. To express themselves, in multitudes of colors, they have evolved novel gene pools.\n\nA Cellulaire may have inside itself yet bigger cells; those created by its surface intersecting itself. And on its membrane that is porous, it hosts whimsical vesicles, or maybe a lotus; sometimes hiding in private quarters, draped with fanciful silk, velvet, or lace.\n\nBut let's go beyond all this hocus pocus.\n\nSome Cellulaires look like chapels; light peeking through their stained glass windows. Others look more like walled gardens, orchards, or vineyards of grapes. And some look like modern architectural spaces; have you ever stood or walked inside the Sequence (by Richard Serra)? To me, a Cellulaire is a meditation about life itself: how all systems and organisms, natural or man-made, are modular and cellular, built from smaller subsystems with their own boundaries and membranes, that interact, communicate, and evolve together, giving rise to ever more complex systems, patterns, structures, and behaviors. \n\nWith all that, the lotus now invites you to a meditative focus while this opus is rendered on its locus.\n\nControls:\n- Click the mouse to pause/unpause.\n- Press 's' to save a PNG file.\n- Press 't' to toggle, for a larger and higher resolution version that might be partially off screen.

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "“In Due Time” is a collaborative generative collection between artists Melissa Wiederrecht and Amber Vittoria. Inspired by Wiederrecht’s mastery of line and Vittoria’s notable palette, this 1/1/250 series captures the present moment. It serves as a reminder that we are more similar than we are different, leveraging homogeneous shapes to create distinctive compositions.\n\nVittoria’s poem for the collection:\n\n“In Due Time”\nWe will all become\nParticles dancing\nAcross the skyline.\n\nThe artwork listed is indeed authentic, created by, and copyright to artists Melissa Wiederrecht and Amber Vittoria; the purchase of this NFT is a purchase of the asset, not of the copyright.\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\nTo save a high-resolution image for printing, click “open” under the image on the page for your token, and then hit:\n\nDigits “1” through “9” to get an image that is 1000 through 9000px tall.  This may take a while, depending on the size and your computer, so please be patient.",

But not quite.\n\nIt started from a square, that was cracked into many fragments. From outside, it is still a square, stable, reliable. From inside, it is a mess, with many experiences, each one being unique, each one with its own specificity.\n\nEven though we relate to others, there is no definition of normal. No one looks the same. This is why the palettes are all generated and there can be an infinity of them. Some have more darkness than others. Some are warmer, some are cooler. Some are a mix of many things.\n\nOur experiences and our cracks shape us. Sometimes following a natural flow. Sometimes following specific rules. But always guiding us as a whole.\n\n----\n\nThe day I started working on this piece, I realized that I often show myself as chill, ready to give a hand, ready to listen to others. But who am I to help others when I'm not sure about who I am or even what I am?\n\nMaybe that's why I'm able to relate. Because I have my own experiences that cracked me. And built me. So even if I'm a mess, even if I'm not sure about where I'm going, let's share and try to find out together.\n\n----\n\n- The images are meant to be viewed in an horizontal full screen but will adapt to any format\n- Click on the image to restart the animation\n- Hit \"S\" key or long tap on mobile in the live view to trigger an export\n- Add &width=5000 to the live view URL to render the image at 5000 pixels wide\n\n----\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienPradetArt",

            "description": "Being in a space, knowing that we are enveloped by an object—a ground or a wall—made us aware of our external reality. And when a space gains social, cultural, or emotional meaning, it becomes a place.\n\nBut sometimes, these spaces and places betray us, isolating the inhabitants who live in them, as if every room and ground are turning hostile and apathetic to the beings who live within its own walls.\n\nIn the end, as a way to confirm our being, we are wired to belong to a place, whether it's a theoretical place or a physical place. This feeling of being misplaced can happen even in the most hospitable places in the universe.\n\n------------\n11 Color Palette\n4 Variant of \"Home\"\n4 Variant of \"Environment\"\nand some Planetary\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\n\n\nCreated using p5.js\nDirbots - Sep22",
