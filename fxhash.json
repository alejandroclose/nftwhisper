For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels. Note that this will not work with sizes beyond 5000 pixels.\n\n(Allowlist is based on quantity of previous works owned).",

However upon examination discernible patterns begin to emerge revealing a semblance of order amidst the commotion. This is the essence of art; the harmony that arises within the boundaries of programmed randomness.\n\nThe vibrant colors, seemingly chosen at whim seamlessly blend together akin, to the dance of the aurora borealis, across a canvas. Lines and textures intertwine, creating a landscape of a planets surface; every crevice and peak stands as evidence of the algorithms careful contemplation.\n\nThis artwork softly whispers about the realms concealed within our machines. It speaks to the flow of data and energy that courses through our lives circuits—often unnoticed—yet here it takes on tangible form and captivating shades. The image encourages us to ponder upon the realm of digitization—a realm crafted from code yet resonating with an intriguing kind of vitality.",

            "description": "The Visible Manifestation of Invisible Forces\n\n“Fantasies of the past determined by needs of the present have a direct impact on realities of the future.” –– Svetlana Boym\n\n\nThis series continues my explorations into generative abstract expressionism, building on the techniques and approaches of my previous works “THE400FLIPS” and “a fortiori.” This time viewers can interact with the piece by adding more particles onto the canvas, effectively altering the behaviour set by the transaction hash —a collaboration between the artist, chance, and the collector. \n\nArt is fantastic and induces fantasies: This is one of those cases where the art is more than the thumbnail. I encourage you to run the code and interact with the canvas. As you alter the outputs, you will experience them as fleeting moments. Seen and gone, unless you are fast enough to catch them as we do with photographs: use the spacebar to pause the animation, then save a png image file by pressing “s”.\n\nConsider each reload and interaction a new simulation of life.\n\n\nThis work is, at its core, an implementation of Craig Reynolds’s Boids program to simulate the flocking behaviour of birds. As such, the flocking parts used in this work are released under the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nControls:\n[s] Save as PNG.\n[spacebar] or [x][z] Pause/Play.\n[Click and drag] Add more particles to the canvas.\n\n\nSoundtrack:\nI curated a Spotify soundtrack to accompany the work. Enjoy:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Nn2dM4cLqOukBDcryKk1d?si=cc48c678e6f34c2b\n\n\nNotes:\nCreated with p5.js and GLSL – optimised for Chrome – designed to be experienced on a desktop computer.\n\nThe preview capture module uses GPU instances. It may take time for thumbnails to appear. \n\n\nWarning:\nIt contains flashing lights and colours that may affect people with visual sensitivities.\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2023 Thomas Noya\n\n◉_◉",

            "description": "\"In the boundless loneliness of space, strangeness abounds.\"\nT E C T O N I C A logs\n\nStanding here are the digital engrams of a spacefaring civilization, the final remnants of the Universe's vast computer, a layered stratum of glitched, galaxy-sized digital memory banks. These calcified data deposits have accumulated over eons, forming physical tectons that span light-years of space. They offer a glimpse into the fundamental building blocks employed by a forgotten alien civilization which encoded its entire culture as digital data in physical form. While the specifications for this stellar machine have been lost to time, its fractured components continue to perform computations, seemingly trapped in an eternal loop. We can observe the inner workings of this enigmatic structure, but its true meaning remains forever silent, its message encrypted.\n\nT E C T O N I C A serves as an artistic exploration of this fictional world and its algorithm-driven deep-space geology. Collectors can reserve their iteration by minting a ticket and use the params interface to choose their seed number and triptych part. Generator uses a WYSIWYG principle to derive a PRNG seed from the wallet address and the chosen seed number. There are 1000 seeds available for each wallet. You can explore seeds using a separate seed explorer here:\n\nhttps://protocell-labs.github.io/tectonica-seed-explorer/\n\n__________\n\nT E C T O N I C A is written in JavaScript using Three.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry and in-browser rendering (see LICENSE file for the list of all dependencies). We recommend using Chromium browser on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration to get the full functionality (like key controls). Please ensure that the token functions correctly on your device before minting.\n\nUse click (touch) to explode / unexplode the structure, click hold (touch hold) to set new explosion center (also E + click), P for pause / unpause palette cycle, B to change background color, S to download loader animation, G for gif capture, and numbers 1-5 to export progressively higher resolution of the artwork as a png image. Available URL parameters are listed in the browser console.\n\nWe paid tribute to artists and personalities who inspire our work by naming color palettes after them. To support other fellow artists on their creative journeys, we have left T E C T O N I C A code open (unminified and unobfuscated) and available in a public repository on GitHub. We believe that supporting open tools is a mission every generative artist should partake in.\n\nCreated in 2024 by {protocell:labs}",

            "description": "\"In the boundless loneliness of space, strangeness abounds.\"\nT E C T O N I C A logs\n\nStanding here are the digital engrams of a spacefaring civilization, the final remnants of the Universe's vast computer, a layered stratum of glitched, galaxy-sized digital memory banks. These calcified data deposits have accumulated over eons, forming physical tectons that span light-years of space. They offer a glimpse into the fundamental building blocks employed by a forgotten alien civilization which encoded its entire culture as digital data in physical form. While the specifications for this stellar machine have been lost to time, its fractured components continue to perform computations, seemingly trapped in an eternal loop. We can observe the inner workings of this enigmatic structure, but its true meaning remains forever silent, its message encrypted.\n\nT E C T O N I C A serves as an artistic exploration of this fictional world and its algorithm-driven deep-space geology. Collectors can reserve their iteration by minting a ticket and use the params interface to choose their seed number and triptych part. Generator uses a WYSIWYG principle to derive a PRNG seed from the wallet address and the chosen seed number. There are 1000 seeds available for each wallet. You can explore seeds using a separate seed explorer here:\n\nhttps://protocell-labs.github.io/tectonica-seed-explorer/\n\n__________\n\nT E C T O N I C A is written in JavaScript using Three.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry and in-browser rendering (see LICENSE file for the list of all dependencies). We recommend using Chromium browser on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration to get the full functionality (like key controls). Please ensure that the token functions correctly on your device before minting.\n\nUse click (touch) to explode / unexplode the structure, click hold (touch hold) to set new explosion center (also E + click), P for pause / unpause palette cycle, B to change background color, S to download loader animation, G for gif capture, and numbers 1-5 to export progressively higher resolution of the artwork as a png image. Available URL parameters are listed in the browser console.\n\nWe paid tribute to artists and personalities who inspire our work by naming color palettes after them. To support other fellow artists on their creative journeys, we have left T E C T O N I C A code open (unminified and unobfuscated) and available in a public repository on GitHub. We believe that supporting open tools is a mission every generative artist should partake in.\n\nCreated in 2024 by {protocell:labs}",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.
