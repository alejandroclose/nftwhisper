            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "Cuts is an abstract representation of the exact moments in our lives when something is cut. It could be moving to a different country, being fired, quitting a bad habit, when a relationship ends or when you receive a very bad (or good!) news.\nBy themselves, cuts are not positive or negative events; it really depends on who you were before and who you wish to be after. But one thing is sure: every cut creates a new space that wasn’t there. This space could be small or huge, ordered or chaotic, regardless, you have to deal with it. Sometimes cuts try to resist and heal themselves extruding the core of the fibres we are made of, but they will fail. A cut is irreversible and it’s up to us to fill the gap with meaning.\n\nMain features include:\n- Curated palettes (21)\n- Drawing modes (3)\n- Extrusions (yes/no)\n- Orientation (3)\n- Overlapping (yes/no)\n- Covered area (2)\n- Cut position (2)\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [s] to save a 2400x2400 px image\n- Press [t] to toggle shading (sometimes flat colours rock!)\n- Press [c] to see copyright notice\n- Press [f] to log features in console\n\nBy Todemashi 2022\nNFT License 2.0\n\n### NOTES\nMade with p5js and GLSL shaders.\nShaders are based on tutorials and code by Patricio Gonzalez Vivo - The Book of Shaders - https://thebookofshaders.com/",

            "description": "The preparations for the first mission began in 2142. It had become clear that mining petroleum on Earth would soon become financially unfeasible, so looking to other planets was the only logical choice. It took seventeen more years to perfect the technology so that the first colonists could reach Proxima b within the lifetime of one generation.\n\nAfter 45 years of travelling at almost one-tenth of the speed of light, they reached their new home. It was rich in petrochemicals but scarce in the nutrients necessary for long term human survival. After merely six generations, humanity was forced to travel once again in search of a new world. The four missions that parted from the Proxima system to colonise other possibly habitable planets in the galaxy sparked a new age of human civilisation that would never see itself united and thriving again.\n\nEventually, all the colonies became independent societies as their differing interests drove them apart. Each small civilisation chose its path, wandering the void of space alone. Over time, millions of kilometres apart, each colony developed its own culture and traditions. While their habits and customs changed, some things remained the same across all the societies, like how it became a certain tradition to convert the outer world years and days to Earth time and celebrate holidays according to the calendar of the old world.\n\nThe new nomads learned from the first pilgrims. They used the technology once optimised for oil extraction to traverse other worlds, searching for sustenance. Peculiar wandering nonspaces emerged from the involuntary degrowth of human civilisation.\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "Dencity is a generative art project inspired by aerial views of cities with a high density of buildings. Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

You can scale up using 1,2,3 and 4 of you keyboard to increase the quality of resolution (it may create some variations on the art itself, and it should be done before clicking on canvas)\n\nThe preview is only a sketch of the artwork, since the livecoding functions vary depending on the interaction.\n\nThis project was designed in Hydra.js for Desktop computers on Chrome.\n\nSince it is a livecoding library there may be small differences in each code execution, but the deterministic character remains.\n\nThe machine waits for your command to start drawing - there is no plan or goal, sometimes the values assigned to the variables would lead to the construction of a visually recognizable work, but the fact that these values are randomized 4 times during the duration of the interaction breaks the logical line of visual conduction.\n\nI can only appeal to Gestalt, and beg you to make the effort to see the whole divided between 4 apparently disconnected patterns. This is not just a code that generates noises, I am here making a testament to push once again the limit of abstraction, to perhaps convince you that there is immense beauty in discontinuity.\n\nAnd it is worth commenting once again that without your click/command, the machine will be eternally lodged in the server waiting - and not knowing what it is waiting for. And this waiting is the most beautiful thing in the world, because the art is already determined to happen, its strokes and patterns were defined when the hash was tied to the code, the art was already made and already exists in the moment preceding this one - but for a computer time does not exist.\n\nThe Unrealized Painting has come to remind you that we, the ones with souls and who feel time, control the realizable and the unrealizable - and it will never stop being that way.",

            "description": "Click to start.\n\nThe size of the canvas is proportional to the monitor. You can scale up using 1,2,3 and 4 of you keyboard to increase the quality of resolution (it may create some variations on the art itself, and it should be done before clicking on canvas)\n\nThe preview is only a sketch of the artwork, since the livecoding functions vary depending on the interaction.\n\nThis project was designed in Hydra.js for Desktop computers on Chrome.\n\nSince it is a livecoding library there may be small differences in each code execution, but the deterministic character remains.\n\nThe machine waits for your command to start drawing - there is no plan or goal, sometimes the values assigned to the variables would lead to the construction of a visually recognizable work, but the fact that these values are randomized 4 times during the duration of the interaction breaks the logical line of visual conduction.\n\nI can only appeal to Gestalt, and beg you to make the effort to see the whole divided between 4 apparently disconnected patterns. This is not just a code that generates noises, I am here making a testament to push once again the limit of abstraction, to perhaps convince you that there is immense beauty in discontinuity.\n\nAnd it is worth commenting once again that without your click/command, the machine will be eternally lodged in the server waiting - and not knowing what it is waiting for. And this waiting is the most beautiful thing in the world, because the art is already determined to happen, its strokes and patterns were defined when the hash was tied to the code, the art was already made and already exists in the moment preceding this one - but for a computer time does not exist.\n\nThe Unrealized Painting has come to remind you that we, the ones with souls and who feel time, control the realizable and the unrealizable - and it will never stop being that way.",
