            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

It starts with a collection of analog photographs, shot on film and scanned that were later used as a training dataset in Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training. This way, A.I. learns the main characteristics of film photography. In particular, it mimics its recognizable grain. Another type of pixel grain is added with the use of code and pixel shifting as well as digital manipulation.

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "Every artist and collector feels the joy of both creating and collecting. But if I could share the joy of creating with collectors. And collectors with their family and friends, what may be an additive process of joy is now perhaps exponential. Joy to the power of 26 to be exact. \n\nIn this work I invite my friends and collectors to collaborate with me. Though not in coding, but together in a process of creating narratives and visuals. Code and story. We didn’t use github, just a simple p5.js editor to try out different programs and palettes. Pedrofe and J0rdan pick their palettes tastefully and carefully. okeoke, perhaps more of a genius than he lets on, picks his palettes blind. No hex color picker. Just straight up rhymes.  \n\nIn our discussions verbal language was forbidden. Only emojis were allowed to express our tastes and views. Each emojis put down on google doc was taken with absolutely seriousness. \n\nPedro: Loves to taking his daily walks on “Magic Mushroom Mountain”\n\nJ0rdan: Wonders about “Quark Question Quiches”\n\nOkeoke: Just get lost in “Finnegans’ Flower Fields.”\n\nIt has been a great joy to present our illustration book A24Z, 8 more than you know who. Each page expresses the alphabet with the best of our knowledge in semantics and sarcasm. Collect just 1 page, collect the alphabets that spell out your name, collect the whole A to Z. Read it to your children or loved ones. Though you might need to interpolate or extrapolate with great imagination which children all have. But most importantly, like all children, have fun!\n\nPress 1 to save png, only for Chrome, not Safari.

            "description": "Boundary Conditions is based on a personal observation about the nature of existence: that it is most clear at the interface between two separate aspects of reality. We enjoy the merging of sea and land, congregate at the boundaries of the land and the sky, tenuously ponder—in small, select groups—the limits where atmosphere dwindles into vacuum. Life is about the transition from one state to another, maintaining a precarious existence on the edge of everything.\n\nAt the heart of Boundary Conditions is micro-managed Perlin noise, produced as small points and patches of colour. Rendering takes place over three hundred and sixty frames, with the number of points rendered increasing as time passes. This allows the piece to initially form a general overview, and fill in the finer details as time passes. This results in the piece fading gently into view over several seconds, but allows the rendering process to be part of the experience, rather than presenting the viewer with a blank screen or a progress bar.\n\nThe main focus of the image is the ‘grains’ layer—the dark, spattered series of grouped dots that form sweeping, striated patterns. A spattering technique is used, as though the grains were splashes of paint flung onto the canvas with vigorous brushstrokes. Amongst them, more saturated and thicker lines of colour accentuate one side of the grains, within certain chosen parameters, like shadows on the sides of a dunes, or the ripples left in sand by the receding tide.\n\nLarger swathes of colour, termed ’dunes’, are added in such a way as to form patches, or thick striations. Along these paths larger circles of ink may be added, sometimes singly, sometimes in a pattern of splashes. Further shading is added to alter shading over the space of the entire instance. The ‘sand’ layer is a tighter, more extreme band of colour, but is intentionally limited so as not to overpower the piece.\n\nLarger geometric shapes are sometimes overlaid: both circles and rectangles. These, too, are stippled in various ways, often fading so that only their corners, or partial edges, are visible.\n\nRotation is applied, perhaps, at intervals of ninety degrees, or maybe in more subtle ways—sometimes a forty-five degree rotation will produce a diagonal rendering. This is in addition to the rotation of individual blocks, although the two may work against each other, leaving only part of the instance rotated.\n\nThe main image produced using the above techniques is taken and used as a building block for the finished piece. It may appear as a background to the entire image, and may then be broken into parts to provide the finished piece. These blocks may be small, may be large, may be further subdivided, or may not even be rendered at all. Sometimes they will be reversed or rotated, sometimes shifted. The grid formations are chosen from a number of sub-styles.\n\nScaling allows for the image to move beyond the limits of the canvas, or be constrained within it. It also provides the possiblity of a sector being only slightly displaced from the background, leading to something akin to motion-blur. Sometimes a piece will be scaled to extremes of value.\n\nNot all pieces are coloured, and in general the colours are muted and saturation is low. However, the saturation level is variable, and in rare cases can lead to completely greyscale images or, athe other extreme, instances where the saturation values are pushed to twice the standard value. Rarely is a piece saturated to the point where clipping of hue values occurs, but the possiblity is there. A dark mode exists in a small proportion of pieces.\n\nPressing 'I' whilst the piece is active will bring up an information panel. This will show which render layers are currently available; they can be activated and deactivated using the number keys.\n\nThe rendered image, at a resolution of 2048x2048 can be saved with 'S', whilst the actual viewport canvas, at whatever resolution the piece is currently running in, can be saved with 'C'.\n\n'R' and 'P' provide options for re-rendering with and without new parameters.",

Where color is one of the most important values. Our goal is to visualize all the richness and versatility of human emotions with the help of color. What, if not color, is able to convey the whole gamut of feelings and experiences that we experience.  Every bright event in our life, both positive and negative, always leaves its mark in our memory. We show it through lines – it's like wrinkles on the face, marks of the experience, like a note on a sheet, a dash / tick, like an entry in the diary of life, where the sheet on which we made a note is colored in the color of emotions and sensations that we experienced again and again. It's always a lot of mixed shades that have their own unique palette.  The fundamental emotions and feelings such as anger, sadness, fear, disgust, joy and love are taken. Each token is one emotion, where with the help of color we show how multifaceted it can be.",

            "description": "'Murals' is a collection of 256 abstract compositions born out of an intense period diving deeply into street art, pointillism and the inner workings of neural networks.\n\nThe work explores projection, refraction and abstraction of points as they ripple through multi-dimensional space-time. Points refract through multi-dimensional space to become shapes, which then become coordinate systems for the projections of new points that create a sense of form, texture, lighting, and material properties. \n\nThe work is also a celebration of imperfections and how a combination of many tiny – almost individually imperceptibly small – imperfect details can shape our perceptions of form, materiality, mood. This is explored within this work through subtle uses of sprays, flecks, scuffs, cuts, grain, targets (projections of projections), construction lines, base projections, occasional glitches that cause curvature, bounced light, shadows, and more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n15 colour palettes: \nScream, Night Bus, Double Backflip, Jaws, Sunday, Atom, Space, Tipex, \nGraphite, Leaf, Earth, Bubble Gum, Citrus, Jellyfish, Damp Concrete.\n\n4 times of day (that create subtle changes in light colour):\nDaylight, Winter Morning, Midnight, Sunset\n\n2 Border types: \nNormal, Thin\n\nVarious features that subtly impact appearance surface textures and shard forms:\nMetallic, Engrave, Number of Shards, Scuff Marks, Symmetry. \n\nControls:\n- Press [ S ] to save the work at its current image size as a PNG.\n- Press [ 1 ] to set the image size to 1440 x 1944 pixels (default size)\n- Press [ 2 ] to set the image size to 2880 x 3888 pixels\n- Press [ 3 ] to set the image size to 4320 x 5832 pixels\n\n- Press [ F ] to toggle freeform mode to create custom image sizes and aspect ratios\n- Press [ R ] to reload the image (for use in freeform mode)\n\nThis work has been tested on Chrome and Safari on Mac OS, and also using an Android smartphone. Please make sure that it works on your device before minting. Based on testing (in May 2022), each work should take about 5-10 seconds to fully load on a laptop or desktop machine, and 15-20 seconds on a mobile device. The loading process is animated so you can watch the construction the static artwork during this time. \n\nThis artwork is created with p5.js \n\n@nbswwit, 2022\n",
