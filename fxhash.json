            "description": "Primitifs systématiques is the first generative instalment of David Umemoto’s studies of space and volume. Placed at the crux of brutalism and minimalism, these structures based on the original stackable concrete piece Primitif 04 evoke impossible paths yet to be explored. \n\nThe original Primitif 04 has been both preserved and dented, conserved and enhanced. It is still here. But it cannot be found, only encountered. Throughout your explorations of the Primitifs systématiques, you will find that its original shapes have been multiplied, rotated, re-ordered to create new structures. After spending some time exploring its paths, when you stop looking for it, you will realize that 04 is still here, intact.\n\nLines of work chosen for this piece also draw a perspective. The orientation of the primitives pulls directly towards an intense source of light. Sometimes it is visible, sometimes it is not. This perfect alignment is a call to life. They who look at the sunrise with relief cannot be anything but hopeful. But how can we project life on a concrete behemoth? Stand long enough in front of it, and you too will see that we have no choice but to.\n\n----\n\nPrimitifs systématiques is the generative art genesis piece of David Umemoto. It was built in collaboration with Anaglyphic. It is the first collaborative spatial token made available on the anaver.se.  \n",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines II. Enfantillages Pittoresques” is the second of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Enfantillages Pittoresques” experiments with predefined plots, colour blending, webgl shaders, and generative music; all with a fresh, childish style. This algorithm has been trained to draw basic shapes in accordance to Satie’s lyrics. However, it uses them in unusual ways and creates what looks like fantastic creatures, microscopic beings, or, to follow Corneille, Constant, and Appel: \"human animals\".\n\n“It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child” Attributed to Picasso (falsely, probably)\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines” are best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, these have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\nPress M or Double Tap (mobile) for AUDIO mode\nWait for SILENT mode\nPress I for Trait Info (desktop)\nPress 1 for Canvas Save (desktop)\n\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=171” after URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=X” for HQ renders (standard is 2, and 8 produces 400ppi 40x44cm prints).\n\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been compressed and minified for a performance boost, but can be read fully in GitHub: https://github.com/ratchitect/\n\n\n# PERFORMANCE\nBetter experienced with Chrome.",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

            "description": "Mudaashiku (「無駄足区」- “Fool’s Errand District”) invokes the place where you first really experienced what it means to be a person in a city. Were you awestruck? Did you feel lost or disoriented by a realization of the size of the spaces around you? Perhaps you sought some detail, some small thing to focus on to reorient yourself and feel like a person again in the face of such immensity and confusion.\n\nThis work is inspired by an attempt to capture some of the feeling I had when I first moved to Tokyo and was utterly overwhelmed. It was both exciting and frightening to suddenly be lost in a place so immense and unfamiliar. If Stendhal Syndrome refers to the fearful ecstasy of experiencing the beauties of Florence, then there must be something similar for the first experience of a great city. This work attempts only to point in the direction of such a feeling.\n\nTake a moment to experience the district as a whole, but then, with a change of perception, your focus may shift to the individual building or group of buildings. And then, back again. This duality of scales has been integral to the development of the work.\n\nThe work expresses eight features:\nAspect ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.41, 1.41:1, 1.2:1\nEnvironment: Central (most common), north river, east river, south causeway, west causeway (most rare).\nPalette: Thirty seven selected palettes. Chosen either for their aesthetic qualities, or as an attempted expression of some element of urban life.\nDivisions: 15, 18, or 21.\nColor variance: 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36, 0.54.\nSun direction: East or west.\nLocale: Either central or commuter town. Determines the height profile of the district.\nRoads: Represented, or not.\n\nThe work begins by gradually revealing the layout of the district. This process can take from about 6 seconds to as much as 2 minutes, but 50 to 60 seconds is typical. When this process is complete, the colors and facades will be added and the work revealed.\n\nOnce the work is complete, it can be adjusted using the following controls:\n\n[0] Fit size to window (default)\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels\n[4] Set shortest edge to 8000 pixels (please be patient!)\n\nAfter changing the dimensions, the work may appear the same size in your browser. The new dimensions will be apparent when you save an image.\n\n[s] Save work at current dimensions\n[b] Add or remove border\n[g] Add or remove background grain\n\nMade in 100% vanilla javascript.\nOpenSimplexNoise.js used for noise.\n",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines II. Enfantillages Pittoresques” is the second of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Enfantillages Pittoresques” experiments with predefined plots, colour blending, webgl shaders, and generative music; all with a fresh, childish style. This algorithm has been trained to draw basic shapes in accordance to Satie’s lyrics. However, it uses them in unusual ways and creates what looks like fantastic creatures, microscopic beings, or, to follow Corneille, Constant, and Appel: \"human animals\".\n\n“It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child” Attributed to Picasso (falsely, probably)\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines” are best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, these have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\nPress M or Double Tap (mobile) for AUDIO mode\nWait for SILENT mode\nPress I for Trait Info (desktop)\nPress 1 for Canvas Save (desktop)\n\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=171” after URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=X” for HQ renders (standard is 2, and 8 produces 400ppi 40x44cm prints).\n\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been compressed and minified for a performance boost, but can be read fully in GitHub: https://github.com/ratchitect/\n\n\n# PERFORMANCE\nBetter experienced with Chrome.",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

It links a thousand pairs of points, harmoniously shifting across the canvas, with delicate lines. At each intersection of these lines, color is applied. To produce the final piece, multiple layers of varying colors and intensities are superimposed.\n\n------\n\nControls:\n\n- [x] Save a PNG\n\n- [1] Set height to 768\n- [2] Set height to 1152 \n- [3] Set height to 1536 (default)\n- [4] Set height to 2304\n- [5] Set height to 3072* \n- [6] Set height to 6144*\n- [7] Set height to 9216*\n- [8] Set height to 11520*\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render height\n\n\n* images with height over 3000 pixels render without animating, downloads a PNG automatically after rendering\n\nPlease note that high resolution outputs will take several minutes or even longer to render.
