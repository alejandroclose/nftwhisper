            "description": "Kelp represents the third \"published\" output of our renewed collaboration. We were inspired by an underwater photograph taken looking through a kelp field and upward toward the sun. An old art professor of mine told me that art comes from nature so this is a concerted effort to bring some of that into our imagery.\n\nThis is a layered image. The background layer has a 50% probability of being a radial gradient representing the sun. Of the remaining 50%, the background can be a solid random color 25%, or 25% of the time no color or white. \n\nForward from the background, based on some more random probability, from one to possibly four layers of kelp lines can be drawn. The kelp lines are a variation Chris' vector field/ linear interpolation algorithm where the lines never cross but with a refinement. The thickness of a \"kelp\" line is not constant, it varies in width sinusoidally. The amount of thickness is relative to the z-depth of the layer. \n\nIt was very tempting to sway the kelp in the ocean current but we'll save this idea for another time.\n\nWe give you the option to decide. The images produced by the algorithms in this composition have the voluptuous, organic quality of an underwater landscape with or without the sun in the background. We hope you enjoy our attempt at nature in this collaboration.\n\nOur story: In 1973 I was an instructor of Engineering Graphics in the College of Engineering at Michigan State University as well as a graduate student in Graphic Design. In the College of Engineering I was fortunate enough to meet Christopher Scussel, a fellow graduate student who was majoring in a new program called Computer Science. I was struggling using the earliest forms of computer equipment and the cumbersome programming language called FORTRAN to make make computer art. I asked Chris for help and he graciously consented. That began our amazing friendship that has lasted to this day.\n\nChris and I collaborated on a number of early pieces. He showed me how to formulate algorithms into code. He showed me how to program the primitive equipment of the time: line printers, storage scopes and pen plotters to make graphic output. We even built our own graphic output device, an 8 x 8 array of light bulbs. We were indeed pioneers.\nChris graduated in 1976 and has since retired after working 37 years as a research scientist at Bell Labs. I went on to get a Ph.D in 1981 and moved on with my life (see my story on (www.drbillkolomyjec.com). I started making generative art again in 2020. In true \"glory days\" spirit I tracked Chris down to see if he was interested in collaborating. Once again he graciously consented citing an opportunity for \"creative stimulation\", so here we go again. It is pure joy to be working with Chris again. \n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Kelp represents the third \"published\" output of our renewed collaboration. We were inspired by an underwater photograph taken looking through a kelp field and upward toward the sun. An old art professor of mine told me that art comes from nature so this is a concerted effort to bring some of that into our imagery.\n\nThis is a layered image. The background layer has a 50% probability of being a radial gradient representing the sun. Of the remaining 50%, the background can be a solid random color 25%, or 25% of the time no color or white. \n\nForward from the background, based on some more random probability, from one to possibly four layers of kelp lines can be drawn. The kelp lines are a variation Chris' vector field/ linear interpolation algorithm where the lines never cross but with a refinement. The thickness of a \"kelp\" line is not constant, it varies in width sinusoidally. The amount of thickness is relative to the z-depth of the layer. \n\nIt was very tempting to sway the kelp in the ocean current but we'll save this idea for another time.\n\nWe give you the option to decide. The images produced by the algorithms in this composition have the voluptuous, organic quality of an underwater landscape with or without the sun in the background. We hope you enjoy our attempt at nature in this collaboration.\n\nOur story: In 1973 I was an instructor of Engineering Graphics in the College of Engineering at Michigan State University as well as a graduate student in Graphic Design. In the College of Engineering I was fortunate enough to meet Christopher Scussel, a fellow graduate student who was majoring in a new program called Computer Science. I was struggling using the earliest forms of computer equipment and the cumbersome programming language called FORTRAN to make make computer art. I asked Chris for help and he graciously consented. That began our amazing friendship that has lasted to this day.\n\nChris and I collaborated on a number of early pieces. He showed me how to formulate algorithms into code. He showed me how to program the primitive equipment of the time: line printers, storage scopes and pen plotters to make graphic output. We even built our own graphic output device, an 8 x 8 array of light bulbs. We were indeed pioneers.\nChris graduated in 1976 and has since retired after working 37 years as a research scientist at Bell Labs. I went on to get a Ph.D in 1981 and moved on with my life (see my story on (www.drbillkolomyjec.com). I started making generative art again in 2020. In true \"glory days\" spirit I tracked Chris down to see if he was interested in collaborating. Once again he graciously consented citing an opportunity for \"creative stimulation\", so here we go again. It is pure joy to be working with Chris again. \n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

Franke, a pioneer of computer art, passed away on July 16, 2022 at the age of 95. CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE is an homage to Franke’s MONDRIAN software developed for the Texas Instruments TI 99/4 home computer in 1979, and it’s a fundraiser to digitize his archive:\n\n“Our goal is to raise 20,000 Euro so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. If we raise more money, it will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.” \n\nEach frame, a single “pixel” is added to the CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE image. When the software first loads, 100,000 frames are run in the background to start things off. Keep it running for hours or days to see it transform entirely — it’s an “infinite animation.”",

            "description": "‘tur1ng’ consists of audible image architectures based on the principle of Turing machines. These systems are mathematical models of computation that manipulate symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules. The machine first writes a symbol in a cell on the tape, then either moves the tape one cell left or right, then, based on the observed symbol and the machine's own state in the table, either proceeds to another instruction or halts computation.\n\nIn ‘tur1ng’, rules are stored as colors and the original tape cells are constructed from a two dimensional array. The sound unfolds as the algorithm proceeds: monitoring these binary songs requires being attentive to changes in the state or behavior of the system over time so that appropriate interventions or other process-related activities may be carried out. Another feature of listening algorithms is that it often has to be done as a background or secondary task or, perhaps, in parallel with one or more other primary tasks.\n\nTouch to listen.",

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",
