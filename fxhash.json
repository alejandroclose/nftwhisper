            "description": "In the creation of \"Asta,\" a tapestry of mathematical precision and mythological grandeur unfolds before the viewer. The name itself is an ode to the Old Norse term \"Ástríðr,\" which combines \"ás,\" or the divine, with \"fríðr,\" the beautiful. Much like the gods and goddesses of Norse mythology, \"Asta\" dwells in a space where disparate forces like unity and fragmentation or chaos and order find harmony.\n\nThe visual core of the artwork is composed of concentric circles meticulously shaped from individual spheres. Each circle, akin to the realms over which Norse gods presided, is a universe unto itself, yet all function as part of an overarching cosmic design. The deities of Norse lore were complex beings, embodying both virtues and flaws, and such dualities reverberate through each sphere and orbit within the piece.\n\nServing as a backdrop for this celestial assembly is a canvas marked by signs of distress and decay. This reflects the concept of entropy inherent in Norse cosmology—often symbolized by the serpent Jormungandr biting its own tail to form a circle. Circles that appear to have lost their center drift aimlessly, reminiscent of gods who have fallen from grace, thereby capturing the unpredictable and imperfect nature of existence.\n\n\"Asta\" is not merely a visual spectacle; it's an invitation to embark on a philosophical exploration. As viewers traverse the delicate balance between intricate patterns and intentional anomalies, they are compelled to confront the eternal dualities symbolized in Norse mythology—such as order and chaos, the finite and the infinite, and the divine and the mortal.\n\nFor those who engage with it, \"Asta\" serves as more than just an art piece. It becomes a poetic meeting with the sublime and a tribute to the complexities that both life and mythology bestow upon the human experience.\n\nControls\n========\nThe controls are as follows:\n- Press `t` - 370 x 200 png output (thumbnail)\n- Press `1` - 650 x 1200 png output\n- Press `2` - 1300 x 2400 png output\n- Press `3` - 1950 x 3600 png output\n- Press `4` - 3250 x 6000 png output\n- Press `5` - 5200 x 9600 png output\n- Press `6` - 7800 x 14400 png output\n\nPlease note that the larger the output, the longer it will take to generate.",

            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac.

            "description": "In the creation of \"Asta,\" a tapestry of mathematical precision and mythological grandeur unfolds before the viewer. The name itself is an ode to the Old Norse term \"Ástríðr,\" which combines \"ás,\" or the divine, with \"fríðr,\" the beautiful. Much like the gods and goddesses of Norse mythology, \"Asta\" dwells in a space where disparate forces like unity and fragmentation or chaos and order find harmony.\n\nThe visual core of the artwork is composed of concentric circles meticulously shaped from individual spheres. Each circle, akin to the realms over which Norse gods presided, is a universe unto itself, yet all function as part of an overarching cosmic design. The deities of Norse lore were complex beings, embodying both virtues and flaws, and such dualities reverberate through each sphere and orbit within the piece.\n\nServing as a backdrop for this celestial assembly is a canvas marked by signs of distress and decay. This reflects the concept of entropy inherent in Norse cosmology—often symbolized by the serpent Jormungandr biting its own tail to form a circle. Circles that appear to have lost their center drift aimlessly, reminiscent of gods who have fallen from grace, thereby capturing the unpredictable and imperfect nature of existence.\n\n\"Asta\" is not merely a visual spectacle; it's an invitation to embark on a philosophical exploration. As viewers traverse the delicate balance between intricate patterns and intentional anomalies, they are compelled to confront the eternal dualities symbolized in Norse mythology—such as order and chaos, the finite and the infinite, and the divine and the mortal.\n\nFor those who engage with it, \"Asta\" serves as more than just an art piece. It becomes a poetic meeting with the sublime and a tribute to the complexities that both life and mythology bestow upon the human experience.\n\nControls\n========\nThe controls are as follows:\n- Press `t` - 370 x 200 png output (thumbnail)\n- Press `1` - 650 x 1200 png output\n- Press `2` - 1300 x 2400 png output\n- Press `3` - 1950 x 3600 png output\n- Press `4` - 3250 x 6000 png output\n- Press `5` - 5200 x 9600 png output\n- Press `6` - 7800 x 14400 png output\n\nPlease note that the larger the output, the longer it will take to generate.",

This composition immediately evokes the multi-dimensional and overlapping narrative of its Norse namesake, Yrsa. Just as Yrsa's life story is steeped in layered relationships and hidden truths, each circle in the artwork obscures and reveals, creating a sense of depth and mystery.\n\nThe varying number of inner circles within each main circle speaks to the unpredictability of life and the many layers of experiences and emotions we each harbor. Just as Yrsa's identity was both revealed and concealed through her relationships, the overlapping circles in the artwork meld into one another, creating a profound interplay of shadow, light, and narrative. This piece is not merely an abstract representation but a poignant exploration of the complexities of existence, the intertwining of lives, and the profound stories lurking just beneath the surface",

            "description": "In the creation of \"Asta,\" a tapestry of mathematical precision and mythological grandeur unfolds before the viewer. The name itself is an ode to the Old Norse term \"Ástríðr,\" which combines \"ás,\" or the divine, with \"fríðr,\" the beautiful. Much like the gods and goddesses of Norse mythology, \"Asta\" dwells in a space where disparate forces like unity and fragmentation or chaos and order find harmony.\n\nThe visual core of the artwork is composed of concentric circles meticulously shaped from individual spheres. Each circle, akin to the realms over which Norse gods presided, is a universe unto itself, yet all function as part of an overarching cosmic design. The deities of Norse lore were complex beings, embodying both virtues and flaws, and such dualities reverberate through each sphere and orbit within the piece.\n\nServing as a backdrop for this celestial assembly is a canvas marked by signs of distress and decay. This reflects the concept of entropy inherent in Norse cosmology—often symbolized by the serpent Jormungandr biting its own tail to form a circle. Circles that appear to have lost their center drift aimlessly, reminiscent of gods who have fallen from grace, thereby capturing the unpredictable and imperfect nature of existence.\n\n\"Asta\" is not merely a visual spectacle; it's an invitation to embark on a philosophical exploration. As viewers traverse the delicate balance between intricate patterns and intentional anomalies, they are compelled to confront the eternal dualities symbolized in Norse mythology—such as order and chaos, the finite and the infinite, and the divine and the mortal.\n\nFor those who engage with it, \"Asta\" serves as more than just an art piece. It becomes a poetic meeting with the sublime and a tribute to the complexities that both life and mythology bestow upon the human experience.\n\nControls\n========\nThe controls are as follows:\n- Press `t` - 370 x 200 png output (thumbnail)\n- Press `1` - 650 x 1200 png output\n- Press `2` - 1300 x 2400 png output\n- Press `3` - 1950 x 3600 png output\n- Press `4` - 3250 x 6000 png output\n- Press `5` - 5200 x 9600 png output\n- Press `6` - 7800 x 14400 png output\n\nPlease note that the larger the output, the longer it will take to generate.",

            "description": "When I was a child walking with my father in the park, he once told me if I could hear the trees talking to each other. I listened, and in the noise of the leaves and seeds in the wind, I truly recognized their languages and voices. I was so overwhelmed by the depth and diversity of the world and the creatures that inhabit it, that it is still one of my most vivid memories. \n\nWhen I walk through parks or forests, I always listen to what they say. It is unlikely that I will ever be able to engage in their dialogue, but it is always like a touch of the magical immensity of life.\n\nWild Palms is the name of a gallery of our friends with whom it is always a pleasure to talk in the language of humans, and they have a garden right in the gallery.\nIn the project we mix childhood memories and friendship, the aesthetics of woodcuts, Polaroid and hand-printed photos with echoes of the digital voice of our present.\n\nThanks to YulikolaY for getting the code ready for production.\n\nMade with love, AI and p5.js code\n\nJanuary, 2023",

            "description": "The concept of 'Dualidad' (duality) is brought to life through the use of opposing elements, circles, and rectangles, in the artwork. \n\nThe circles, like the stillness of a calm pond, remain in close places while they continuously transform. In contrast, the rectangles are a representation of movement and change, constantly traveling across the canvas. \n\nThis balance of opposing elements creates a dynamic tension that draws the viewer in, leaving them mesmerized by the ever-evolving artwork. Expect to see a range of emotions, from the euphoria of joy to the depth of sorrow, as you explore the duality of this project.\n\n-----\n\nThe generative process of each artwork has a typical completion time ranging from 20 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on your PC.\n\n-----\n\nTested on Brave, Opera and Mozilla (Linux systems).

            "description": "## PROJECT DESCRIPTION\n\nWhat is it like to be a sea turtle in the age of plastic?\n\nOur global addiction to single-use plastic is destroying our marine environment. Over 11 million metric tons of waste plastic enter our oceans every year. Thankfully, there is a growing force of ocean defenders rising to combat this crisis. Activists and non-profit organizations around the world are working diligently to solve the ocean plastic problem — but they don’t have nearly enough resources to succeed. This project aims to help.\n\nTurtle Vision uses code, chaos, and regl.js to offer us a glimpse into the experience of a sea turtle in 2023, struggling to survive in an ailing ocean. Turtles prey heavily on jellyfish, but have trouble distinguishing them from the countless plastic bags clogging our oceans given their similar shapes and movement patterns. Because of this, we are finding more and more sea turtles dead on beaches, having starved to death with bellies full of plastic bags.\n\nWe believe that generative art can help to reverse this trend and restore sea turtle populations to pre-plastic levels. Turtle Vision aims to raise money for 5 Gyres, one of the foremost nonprofit groups in the war on single-use plastic. 5 Gyres has a storied pedigree in this space, and has also emerged as a leader amongst conservation organizations in its embrace of blockchain technology.\n\nThis project is a collaboration between renowned generative artist @s_r_r_z, the creator of the iconic Generative Octopuses, and @Casson.tez, a professional ocean conservation activist who works at the intersection of environmentalism and web3.\n\nWe are grateful for the support of Tender.art, fx(hash), TZAPAC, the Tezos Foundation, and the entire Tezos community.\n\n\n## EDITION\n\n- Series size: 534 (it's SEA)\n- Price: 111-99-77-55-33\n- Charity share: 40% of primaries, 5% of secondaries\n\n\n## TECHNICALS\n\nVisuals:\nThis artwork portrays jellyfish intermixed with litter in the ocean, such as plastic bags and masks.

            "description": "This series explores the remnants and imprints of past events; the unintended consequences and marks left behind: The floor of a painter's studio, layered with splatters and spills; the face of a rock, sculpted by the relentless touch of water and ice; the rusty hood of a forsaken car, weathered and chipped under the harsh sun.\n\nThe art piece is crafted by an algorithm simulating the effects of abrasion from a consistent yet dynamic process. It links a thousand pairs of points, harmoniously shifting across the canvas, with delicate lines. At each intersection of these lines, color is applied. To produce the final piece, multiple layers of varying colors and intensities are superimposed.\n\n------\n\nControls:\n\n- [x] Save a PNG\n\n- [1] Set height to 768\n- [2] Set height to 1152 \n- [3] Set height to 1536 (default)\n- [4] Set height to 2304\n- [5] Set height to 3072* \n- [6] Set height to 6144*\n- [7] Set height to 9216*\n- [8] Set height to 11520*\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render height\n\n\n* images with height over 3000 pixels render without animating, downloads a PNG automatically after rendering\n\nPlease note that high resolution outputs will take several minutes or even longer to render.
