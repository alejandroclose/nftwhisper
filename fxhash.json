We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.\n\nI like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!\n\nMade with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.\n\nThere’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter.

            "description": "Lines, our simple geometric friends, are nice and neat ideal forms. Until they’re not. Here they shake, crumble, twist and bend. Just like everything else in our fragile world. We put a lot of faith in lines, from marking out political borders to defining our designs, but maybe they aren’t as reliable as they seem.\n\nIn this work we make small, probing journeys into the space between pure shiny mathematics and the brittle chaos of materiality that this math tries to define. Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.\n\nI like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!\n\nMade with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.\n\nThere’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter. Sometimes unnoticed, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with angst. But always with a kind of truth. And I hope this work can conjure a kind of hazy evocation of all this. The message is only meant to be a feeling, at most.\n\n## Generate a printable version\n\nTo generate a version for printing, add the search parameter `?print=true` to the url. This disables the initial animation and doens't trigger a canvas resize when the window changes size.\n\nYou can then also add your preferred width of canvas by adding a `width` parameter, eg: `?print=true&width=2000`.

            "description": "Lines, our simple geometric friends, are nice and neat ideal forms. Until they’re not. Here they shake, crumble, twist and bend. Just like everything else in our fragile world. We put a lot of faith in lines, from marking out political borders to defining our designs, but maybe they aren’t as reliable as they seem.\n\nIn this work we make small, probing journeys into the space between pure shiny mathematics and the brittle chaos of materiality that this math tries to define. Between the abstract and the concrete we find a gap; a gap where the idealised theories about reality interface awkwardly with the way things actually are.\n\nI like to think about this breakdown and how it raises questions about our theories of the world. We need to trust that basic primitives like lines behave predictably, but it’s also important to realise that our grasp is slippery. It’s particularly fun to try and illustrate this thought using code. Using numbers and computations we end up with a metaphor for the limits of these things!\n\nMade with p5.js and two shader passes, this work begins with a simple shape--a circle or a square--that hides in the background and seeps through to the lines. The first pass draws lines horizontally at a variety of densities and become perturbed by layers of gradient noise, at varying degrees of scale and strength. Then the result gets interpreted into color. We have five palettes reminiscent of the world. Finally, the whole scene passes through a second shader which usually applies a a twist, causing the lines to skew and warp.\n\nThere’s sand in the gears of where our minds meet matter. Sometimes unnoticed, sometimes with pleasure, and sometimes with angst. But always with a kind of truth. And I hope this work can conjure a kind of hazy evocation of all this. The message is only meant to be a feeling, at most.\n\n## Generate a printable version\n\nTo generate a version for printing, add the search parameter `?print=true` to the url. This disables the initial animation and doens't trigger a canvas resize when the window changes size.\n\nYou can then also add your preferred width of canvas by adding a `width` parameter, eg: `?print=true&width=2000`. Depending on your browser there's a limit to the maximum width you can use. Using Chrome on an Apple M1 laptop, I can go up to a width of 4700px, but experiment with what works for you.\n\nOnce the image is ready, press [s] on your keyboard to save as a PNG.\n\nTested in all major browsers on Apple silicon and on windows PC with an Intel chip.",

            "description": "Shattered Obelisks began as a work that is dedicated to my habit of mindlessly drawing on paper when I am stressed, depressed or immersed in difficult thoughts.\n\nLike a patient undergoing psychotherapy and piecing together the causes of unconscious fears and anxieties, I and my artwork have assembled ourselves into something shaped, found order in the chaos and separated it from the external noise.\n\nIt took 3 months of continuous, obsessive work. I have developed a huge library, designed for hand-like drawing. The functionality of this library is four times larger than what is shown in this drop.\n\nI plan to put this library out into the public domain when I deem it complete, and hope that it will help someone express themselves through the creative process as much as it helped for me.\n\nIn case you've encountered a problem with inverted colours, try changing browser or disabling extensions. This problem only occurred once during testing on a massive amount of devices and was resolved by disabling extensions.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES BLOCK:\n\nNOTE 1: This artwork should be viewed at a browser scale of 100%. Reducing the scale will increase the amount of detail, but may unpredictably affect the preservation of the location of secondary objects.\n\nNOTE 2: This work can be printed on a plotter. Click S for saving it in .SVG.\nDetailed instructions and answers to possible questions can be found in the console output of the code.\n\nNOTE 3: This drop is the first one from the series of 3. It will be used as AL ticket in next drops of this series.\n\n@abakshonokoleg\n01.08.2022\nTech: P5.JS\nLicense: CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)",
