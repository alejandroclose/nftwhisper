            "description": "## PROJECT DESCRIPTION\n\nWhat is it like to be a sea turtle in the age of plastic?\n\nOur global addiction to single-use plastic is destroying our marine environment. Over 11 million metric tons of waste plastic enter our oceans every year. Thankfully, there is a growing force of ocean defenders rising to combat this crisis. Activists and non-profit organizations around the world are working diligently to solve the ocean plastic problem — but they don’t have nearly enough resources to succeed. This project aims to help.\n\nTurtle Vision uses code, chaos, and regl.js to offer us a glimpse into the experience of a sea turtle in 2023, struggling to survive in an ailing ocean. Turtles prey heavily on jellyfish, but have trouble distinguishing them from the countless plastic bags clogging our oceans given their similar shapes and movement patterns. Because of this, we are finding more and more sea turtles dead on beaches, having starved to death with bellies full of plastic bags.\n\nWe believe that generative art can help to reverse this trend and restore sea turtle populations to pre-plastic levels. Turtle Vision aims to raise money for 5 Gyres, one of the foremost nonprofit groups in the war on single-use plastic. 5 Gyres has a storied pedigree in this space, and has also emerged as a leader amongst conservation organizations in its embrace of blockchain technology.\n\nThis project is a collaboration between renowned generative artist @s_r_r_z, the creator of the iconic Generative Octopuses, and @Casson.tez, a professional ocean conservation activist who works at the intersection of environmentalism and web3.\n\nWe are grateful for the support of Tender.art, fx(hash), TZAPAC, the Tezos Foundation, and the entire Tezos community.\n\n\n## EDITION\n\n- Series size: 534 (it's SEA)\n- Price: 111-99-77-55-33\n- Charity share: 40% of primaries, 5% of secondaries\n\n\n## TECHNICALS\n\nVisuals:\nThis artwork portrays jellyfish intermixed with litter in the ocean, such as plastic bags and masks.

            "description": "Henge is an exploration of circular megalithic structures of the prehistoric age. It is a work of historical fiction where these stone assemblies, achieved through herculean efforts of stacking, aligning, and balancing immense chiseled rocks, are reimagined within an alternate universe of algorithmic possibility. Historically, henges share a few qualities that inspired this project. First, they are places of gathering within a loose collection of stones to organize ceremony or worship under celestial alignments. They are also monolithic in their materiality and employ the most elemental techniques of megalithic, or large stone, construction. These particular types of henges, known as cromlechs, are circular spaces fit with purpose and ritual and in this sense, serve as precedents to the great human edifices; charging landscapes with meaning and presence through geometry and order. Finally, henges are a collective language of place-making shared across a range of cultures and ages, from the Mesolithic and Neolithic eras and across territories from modern-day Morocco, Portugal, Brazil, Germany, Scandinavia, to the well-known Stonehenge in Great Britain.\n\nThis project is deeply inspired by the timeless and universal narrative created through the thoughtful and deliberate placement of large rocks in a circle. It seems that when confronted with marking a place and communing with nature, human beings like to make circles out of stones. Among all the symbols of place making, the circle is the original and still remains the most universal. Through the use of code to portray these imperfect structures, Henge animates the history of these circles in all their roughness and seemingly endless variation.\n\n\n--------\n\nCreated by Aranda\\Lasch @ArandaLasch\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\nNovember 2022\n\n[Interaction instructions]\n'left' + 'right' arrow keys to change view\n'i' saves a 2048x2048 PNG\n\n[Info]\np5.js\nHenge is optimized for Chrome, runs slowly on Firefox (the longer the wait, the more stones and/or grass are being generated)\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n10% of all primary and secondary proceeds donated directly to Girls Who Code\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

            "description": "Title: \"Punctuated Equilibrium\"\n\nBespoke artwork that also acts as a token for a yearly subscription to The Tickle - 12 monthly issues of the pre-eminent magazine for contemporary digital art and creative writing (@inwarhol@twitter.com). This special artwork for the February issue is created by Andrew Brereton (@aebrer@genart.social), entitled \"Punctuated Equilibrium\". Each monthly issue is airdropped on the first Friday of each month to holders of the token. Primary collection activates the subscription - secondary collectors simply adopt the existing subscription, receiving all remaining issues. \n\nHolders also become members of The Tickle Subscribers Club, gaining access to exclusive airdrops of free art from our featured artists!\n\n-- \n\nPunctuated Equilibrium is a piece about Entropy Locking and searching infinite spaces. Roughly every 10 seconds, the current equilibrium is checked, and if it doesn't meet the right conditions, the random seed is incremented. Each search leaves its own trace behind, getting sucked into the final equilibrium which is reached (if a valid solution is discovered). This can happen right away, or it can take infinite time.\n\nThe seed is akin to the \"conditions\" of the world these pixels live in (due to the restrictions imposed by the entropy locking). Just like if our universe had different conditions, different life may have arisen; in this piece each seed provides unique conditions for the (brutally simple) automata rules that push the pixels around. This seed is what is changed when a solution fails.\n\nLike I have done previously in \"RGB Summoning Cycles\", I am using a buffer to inspect the progress of the piece for a given seed. Unlike in RGB Summoning Cycles, this search is strictly destined to succeed: it will always find an equilibrium which modifies all of the displayed pixels in a consistent pattern. However, over time the consequences of the failed searches leave their trace, resulting in the full complexity of the final piece, which is designed to cycle and iterate infinitely within the stable equilibrium it eventually discovers.\n\nIn nature, solutions are not pre-computed: they are evolved out of an insanely complex mess. Often, this plays out via a phenomenon known as \"Punctuated Equilibrium\", or \"Punctuated Evolution\". Long periods of stability cycle regularly with brief periods of massive change. I think we see this pattern simply because it's a reliable way to shake up entrenched, complex, and random systems; after all, we only see the things that succeeded and the equilibria that survived to the present day. Everything else merely remains as traces buried in the noise.\n",

            "description": "Title: \"Punctuated Equilibrium\"\n\nBespoke artwork that also acts as a token for a yearly subscription to The Tickle - 12 monthly issues of the pre-eminent magazine for contemporary digital art and creative writing (@inwarhol@twitter.com). This special artwork for the February issue is created by Andrew Brereton (@aebrer@genart.social), entitled \"Punctuated Equilibrium\". Each monthly issue is airdropped on the first Friday of each month to holders of the token. Primary collection activates the subscription - secondary collectors simply adopt the existing subscription, receiving all remaining issues. \n\nHolders also become members of The Tickle Subscribers Club, gaining access to exclusive airdrops of free art from our featured artists!\n\n-- \n\nPunctuated Equilibrium is a piece about Entropy Locking and searching infinite spaces. Roughly every 10 seconds, the current equilibrium is checked, and if it doesn't meet the right conditions, the random seed is incremented. Each search leaves its own trace behind, getting sucked into the final equilibrium which is reached (if a valid solution is discovered). This can happen right away, or it can take infinite time.\n\nThe seed is akin to the \"conditions\" of the world these pixels live in (due to the restrictions imposed by the entropy locking). Just like if our universe had different conditions, different life may have arisen; in this piece each seed provides unique conditions for the (brutally simple) automata rules that push the pixels around. This seed is what is changed when a solution fails.\n\nLike I have done previously in \"RGB Summoning Cycles\", I am using a buffer to inspect the progress of the piece for a given seed. Unlike in RGB Summoning Cycles, this search is strictly destined to succeed: it will always find an equilibrium which modifies all of the displayed pixels in a consistent pattern. However, over time the consequences of the failed searches leave their trace, resulting in the full complexity of the final piece, which is designed to cycle and iterate infinitely within the stable equilibrium it eventually discovers.\n\nIn nature, solutions are not pre-computed: they are evolved out of an insanely complex mess. Often, this plays out via a phenomenon known as \"Punctuated Equilibrium\", or \"Punctuated Evolution\". Long periods of stability cycle regularly with brief periods of massive change. I think we see this pattern simply because it's a reliable way to shake up entrenched, complex, and random systems; after all, we only see the things that succeeded and the equilibria that survived to the present day. Everything else merely remains as traces buried in the noise.\n",

The hidden secrets of these Ordinary Places can only be revealed through the minting process. In this sense, the outputs are not merely a collection individual scenes, but instead, a coherent world animated by shared themes and narratives.     \n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",
