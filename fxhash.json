They are portals opening our view to rich content.\n\nThis work is a portal to itself. It loads itself within itself 20 times. It's not pretty, it reminds us of WordArt, it's a little bit hacky, it might break when our tools to display HTML will change. But it's a proof that the limits of our tools are only limits until creativity breaks them.\n\nThis work is not purely deterministic, because it simply cannot be. Slight timing differences due to loading times being different each time an <iframe> is loaded will make each visualization slightly unique.\n\nIf you view this token on mobile, the nesting limit was reduced to 4 to prevent performance issues.\n\nThis work is highly experimental. It leverages a \"hack\" to allow iframes to be nested.\nFirefox max <iframe> nesting depth as of 28/12/2021 is capped at 9.\nWorks with chrome desktop 96.0.4664.110",

The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain.

It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random.

            "description": "640 unique sketches of imaginary walls, inspired by the work of Norwegian architect Erling Viksjø (1910–1971) and his artist collaborators. Viksjø designed the Government Quarter in Oslo and invited artists from different disciplines to help design the facades and interiors of the buildings.\n\nViksjø’s aim was to “soften” modernist architecture. He invented «Natural Concrete», a type of concrete that deliberately exposes the mixed-in stones on its surface to give it warmth and a human touch. In my work, I have similar ambitions—using code instead of concrete.\n\nThe different styles of the piece are inspired by, and dedicated to some of the artists who worked together with Viksjø: Jakob Weidemann (~2%), Carl Nesjar (~18%), Odd Tandberg (~30%), and Tore Haaland (~50%).\n\nIn live mode, press ‘S’ to save an image at current resolution or ‘P’ to save a high-resolution file at 6000×6000px (this might take a while depending on your hardware).\n\nOriginal artwork by Andreas Rau · Made with p5.js & glsl · Oslo, 2021",

Inspired by the early pioneering work of the concrete poets such as Dom Sylvester Houédard, Ian Hamilton Finley and Steve McCaffe, the project is a play with letters, words and graphic form in the computational and generative space.\n\nEach iteration gives you the possibility to discover a variety of visual form through exploring the system. Please explore your iteration with the key interactions below. It is hoped that you give the time to explore and observe. If you don't, you may end up with just a blank canvas. \n\nThank you for collecting. \n\nKey Interactions\n\n‘a’ activates forward motion on/off\n‘b’ activates backward motion on/off\n‘r’ rotates grid 45° [ rotates on key pressed]\n‘f’ rotates the grid freely [ stops on key release ]\n‘p’ switches grid scale on/off [ this can be CPU heavy on older machines ] \n‘g’ extra glyphs on/off\n‘q’ return to the initial state \n\n\nProgram written by Mark Webster\nFont is copyright ©simonrenaud\n\nareafour.xyz\n@motiondesign_01",

            "description": "by Daeinc\nAug 2022\n\nDuet explores generative+computational motion and creates an almost infinite sequence of visual compositions. Two groups of shapes transform, merge, and split randomly. What can be disorienting starts to make sense as every element is animated from one to the other. This transition animation is what connects random pieces and creates a relationship between them. Each element is mathematically interpolated, with its motion defined by an equation. \n\nAlthough there are key moments, it is hard to summarize time-based work as a static image. As a constantly evolving generative motion piece, Duet invites viewers to form their impression by feeling the rhythm over time.\n\n## Guide:\n- The animation responds to window aspect ratio. It reproduces the same outcome at the same ratio. \n- For reliable playback, keep the window active and use IPFS view.\n- See browser console for more info.\n- Tested on MacOS 12.5.1 with Chromium 104.0\n\n## Keyboard Interaction\n- [n] to play a new random loop.\n- [spacebar] to play/pause.\n- [s] to save PNG. use URL params for dimensions.\n- [up] and [down] to change shape resolution.\n- [left] and [right] to change BPM. only works while looping. \n- [h] to toggle high DPI mode. off by default.\n- [p] to toggle pixel snapping. off by default.\n\n## URL Parameters\n- add parameters separated by ampersand to the URL ex. https://.../?fxhash=...&w=1200&h=600\n- [w] and [h]: set width and height in pixels. (ex. w=1200&h=600)\n- [s] and [e]: set starting and ending keyframes (inclusive) for loop. (ex. s=20&e=24) \n- setting large values for start/end is not advised.\n- [len]: instead of start/end, set a loop length between 1 and 16. (ex. len=4)\n- [bpm]: beats per minute. (ex. bpm=80)\n- [res]: shape resolution between 0 and 18. (ex. res=2)\n- [pr]: pixel ratio. set it to 2 (or press [h]) for hi-DPI screens.\n- [ar]: maximum aspect ratio. set to any value over 1. 1.2 by default.\n- [snap]: add the param to snap to pixel grid.\n\n## License\nCC BY-NC 4.0\nPlease refer to the included LICENSE.md for license information.\nLibraries used: canvas-sketch, canvas-sketch-util, dom-events, hsv2rgb, keyframes, equations from easings.net, array shuffle from stackoverflow.",

            "description": "aRo \"a Representation of\"\n\nLike a ladder or a hammer, art is often a tool. The less practical and most bizarre, basically the most overcomplicated self-made tool anyone could ever imagine. But it's THE tool to explore ideas.\nI created this one to investigate, to poke and nudge at a few concepts that seem to go hand-in-hand.\nFirstly, Representation, as in changing something to better explain it. Metaphors, symbols, codes —the very fabric of art, religion, and society. And secondly, the aesthetics of recursion or accumulation.\n\nWhile many generative art projects pick buildings and landscapes as their subject, most artworks are made of particles arranged, connected and stretched to create bigger structures, to become textures or both.\n\nBut there's a distinct texture that arises from mobs. And another, somewhat similar, that belongs to the accumulation and hoarding of not-same-objects or shapes.\n\nI can't tell if it's a street grid, a collage, a group of shrines or actual cells, but to scratch all these potential meanings using accumulation, hoarding and mobs, is what brought the texture I was looking for.\n\nWhat happens when a flower has more petals than pixels? Why do we know there's more layers to that thumbnail?\nMy best answer is:\n\n--Press \"s\" key to save a bigger image (2400x3200 px)\n",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",
