            "description": "Star Dance\n\nThis is a 100% generative animated project. Its creation was motivated by the beauty depicted in star trail photos that show the rotation of the earth relative to the stars using long exposures. What if the stars left trails like this on their own? What if they danced in intricate patterns?\n\nOne unique feature of this project is a slider that controls how abstract to render the output. It can vary from realistic starscapes to abstract geometric designs.\n\nStar Dance has 40 distinct movement patterns. Each edition gets a set of about 18 patterns that repeat in an irregular fashion until the animation is stopped. The mixing of a new movement pattern with the previous state of the stars yields intricate beautiful designs. The speed can be set to high for an energetic animation or to very slow for a subtle barely noticeable result. The speed and a couple of other settings can be controlled after minting using URL parameters.\n\nThe art will fill the available space and adapt to different aspect ratios.\n\nThe Params define most but not all of the qualities of each edition. The primary things that vary with the random seed are: 1) the specific motion patterns used and their order, 2) the number and positions of trees, 3) the details of some motion patterns (for example there are many different kinds of spirals used), 4) the exact color noise added to the colors defined in the params, 5) position and phase of the moon, 6) accent slashes in the sky.\n\nMost of the parameters are self-explanatory but here are a few things that are not obvious.\n\nThe alpha values for colors are ignored except for the moon and foreground. If they are set to alpha=0 then the moon and foreground do not get drawn.\n\nAbstraction values over 50 use fewer stars but they are drawn using the 'style' parameter which gives each star a more complex appearance. Abstraction values also impact the moon and foreground unless the 'abstraction for' parameter is set to 'stars only'\n\nCoherence controls how many of the stars follow a new movement pattern. At lower coherence values many of the stars will remain as they were after the previous pattern. This can leave visual echos of the previous patterns giving a more complex overall result. At coherence = 100 the stars will all follow the new pattern.\n\nThe theme pattern appears near the beginning and also appears more frequently than the others. Some patterns are less suitable for themes so there are 28 to choose from out of the complete set of 40. The preview image will be taken during the theme pattern.\n\nThe style only affects the star appearance for abstraction levels greater than 50.\n\nWhen the special setting is 'erode foreground' the foreground and moon will gradually dissolve.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis is a 100% code generated project. Outputs are created in using fx(params) but the speed, abstraction, and coherence properties can be adjusted using URL parameters.\n\nThere are some keyboard operations also\n\nClick on the output and use these keys to affect it:\n'f' - freeze/unfreeze\n's' - save a frame\n\nURL Parameters: To change the speed, abstraction, and coherence values add URL parameters like:\n?abstraction=80&speed=20&coherence=80\nThese values will override what was set at the time of minting.\n\nCopyright 2023 Jeff Clark\n--------------------------\n100% generative\n\nAll drawing and geometric code created by Jeff Clark using standard javascript and canvas 2D api.

Additional patterns are combined in the grid with these distortions to create the final artwork.\n\nPatterns for the individual blocks in the grid are divided into categories, and various amounts are picked for each work, with dozens of possible mixtures. Patterns can flow in different directions across the varied canvases. Distribution of these patterns across the grid varies from work to work, providing for different feels as they bunch together or spread apart.",

            "description": "Cry Diversity is just that - a cry for greater diversity and equality in the genArt community. The UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity beautifully states, “As a source of exchange, innovation and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature.”  Who better to usher in an age of true appreciation for, and active promotion of cultural diversity than a community of artists and collectors.\n\nExcerpts from the UNESCO declaration are embedded in the piece in the form of asemic writing, infusing the piece with the power of the message as it charms the eye.  The collector will also be able to select one of twenty affirmations to be embedded in the work.  Each minted edition will stand as a prayer flag waving permanently on the blockchain spreading its message of belief in a world where we are all valued and respected.  Cry Diversity will be free to collect, but it comes with a challenge.  The collector is expected to actively research the cryptoArt community to find an artist new to them that is a member of an underrepresented group (female, LBGTQIA2+, female identifying, non-binary, POC, global south, etc.).  They are then expected to actively promote that artist and their work for at least one week.  They are expected to personally raise their voice.  Cry Diversity is the second in a series of projects (see the companion piece fx(elevate)) designed to bring attention to individual artists as well as to the value of true commitment to diversity within our community.  It will not be the last.\n\nIt is time to make our cries heard and our actions felt!\n\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint a free edition.  Beginning in the 2nd week, the project will be open to the public for an additional week. Un-minted editions will be burned at the expiration of the 2nd week.\n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Choose your Cry.  Lock it.\n4) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \na) Seed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you have recorded the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the seed to retrieve it.\nb) Cry: What do you want our community to symbolize?  Respect, diversity, compassion?  Choose your favorite characteristic.  It will be baked into your output.\n\nProject Details:\nThis work uses the spectral.js library for the development of color palettes. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in June, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download. Press [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for printing.  \n",

We are covering nature, our home entrusted to us, with our growing waste and trash. We are burying what was once green and blue, under yellow and gray. We are replacing what is pure and beautiful with soulless illusions slipped into our hands in exchange for what makes us human...\n\nYet we still keep trying to reach what we've been intentionally and continuously driving away from us. What we fool ourselves as to be touchable any time we want, is getting more and more unreachable in reality. And as long as we continue to do the same things, we will never be able to reach it.\n\n* * *\n\nOnåbar, Unreachable in Swedish, started to come to life during one of the hardest periods of my life, the hardships of which mostly caused by my own self. With every line of its code, with every brush of its color, it helped me take one step further to leave that hardship behind.\n\nI painted Onåbar using only rectangles, with a long-evolved version of an algorithm I first experimented in my TI·ME series. The mostly colorful nature of Onåbar's palettes come from my replenished hope for reaching the unreachable.\n\nThe more I worked on Onåbar, the more it helped me realize that what seems to be unreachable, in any aspect of life, only seems so because we do everything to keep it stay unreachable, instead of taking the necessary steps towards reaching it. And now, this feels just like the best time to take that first step...\n\n* * *\n\nI hope you will like Onåbar as much as I liked working on it. Thank you very much for collecting and for your continuous support.\n\n10% of primary and secondary sales will go to fxhash team; thank you for what you are doing.\n\nSelf reserved pieces are for promised gifts to my collectors.\n\nPress S to save as PNG.
