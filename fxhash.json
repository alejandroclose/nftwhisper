            "description": "Brushstroke is an algorithm to form a minimal, modern, artistic paint on a canvas. It mimics a painter's hand gesture to apply different types of strokes. Those strokes may vary from thin straight lines to fat curvy arcs. The direction of the strokes may change for each stroke or not. There may be an excessive amount of them as there may be just several. Strokes may intersect and form a group. It generates color palettes as an artist does. There are more than twenty parameters that give variety to pieces. \n\nBrushstroke is built on the p5.js library. As a way of saying thanks, you will contribute to the Processing Foundation by collecting this work. ",

            "description": "Chaotic growth is based on a modified version of the differential line algorithm by Anders Hoff [1]. This algorithm uses an attraction-repulsion-model to imitate growth on a connected set of nodes. \n\nIn this piece I explored an adaption of this algorithm attempting to visualize systems growing past their point of sustainability, creating new dynamics and eventually spiraling out of control. Some iterations may grow smoothly for some time but will quickly turn into a chaotic system of unsustainable growth. The smooth and organic shape of growth in the beginning is contrasted by the spikey, incoherent offshoots. \n\n\nCreated in Vanilla JS.\n\nControls:\nS - Save image\nSpace - Pause/Unpause\n\n\nBest viewed in Chrome. Different browsers may produce slightly different outputs.\n\n[1] https://inconvergent.net/generative/differential-line/",

            "description": "REIN\n\nA generative approach to personal interpretation of reincarnation\n\nIt is not my right and job to prove the existence of reincarnation, but the concept makes a good dialogue for my heart and also is a fun challenge for my brain.\n\n1. About the role:\n\nThe element on the screen is basically the metaphor for every object/person in your current life.\n\nAs the ACTOR, you can make choice under your instant willingness and travel in this world with limited time.\n\nAs the OBSERVER you can watch the above and question and dialogue with the ACTOR and alter its choice.\n\n2. About the visualizations:\n\nIn order to present our big world in a limited 2D graphical approach. I shrink the dimensions and the detail of the existing reality.\n\nHumans and Objects are dots, 3D entities like us become tiny dots (zero dimension) on a 3D space where their activity is backward translated to 2D perspective coordinates\n\nInteractions between two entities are lines, and in our world planes or shapes were formed when interactions involved multiple people or objects. Which becomes an event.\n\nWe now as observer from the higher ground can witness the events’ change, progress, and karma by the continuous growth of the plane into various shapes.\n\nEvery world we reincarnated back into will have a visual color and an audio color tone. It is considered to be the theme of that particular life.\n\nThe final composition becomes a mix of the above, everything is merely the same but everything yet looks different. Depends on your perspective.\"\n\n3. Some personal sharing thru creating REIN:\n\nLife is short - I am happy if you are feeling annoyed and you feel the screen comes and fades so fast. Indeed this is my personal feeling about life, too short and things ended before you realize it.\n\nSome life is super long and boring - I am also happy if you felt so. So sing and discover your song of life when you are in the room. It happens once only with this combination.\n\nNo time to prepare/predict/prejudge - but you can enjoy cause you/he/she/it/they/we will end in here suddenly. So enjoy the up and down, sweet and sour of every bit.\n\nThere is always an intangible target and goal preset to you, and it cast a line between you and it. You can choose to ignore it or be actively chasing it. But no matter which choices you made, your locus was left and shown in front of your eyes.\n\n4. Observer’s responsibility and award\nThis work inspires me that in life we can both be the actors/actress and also the observer.\n\nWhat matters more to you?\nThe background, your choice, or both?\nAre you the observer guy who sits and doesn’t move?\nAre you moving towards the [goal] linking with you? Do you keep chasing it?\nAre you caring about the background more? Do you have a feeling they somehow related to you?\nOr do you simply move your life freely without caring about the other happening?\nYour voice is too loud or not?\nWill you find the background noise too loud?\nWhat can you do with it?\nIf the target connected to you is hollow and empty, would you still care about it?\n\nAnd Why? Why do you feel so?\nWhich part of the above dialogue is related to your existing life?\nWhat can we do/change/keep?\nWhat you really can control?\"\n\n\n// [Click] - The sound of the work can be muted by clicking again the screen\n// [s] - Take a selfie of this world and you inside\n// [spacebar] - you can stop the time and walk/think freely like NEO in the matrix\n\nBehind [REIN]\nAs a generative artist, I force myself to seek the possible ways to use these tools/skills/presentation forms.\n\nIn Traveler, it is about finding the difference between being alone and feeling loneliness\nIn FEA, it is about possibilities\nIn BULLET, it is about courage and faith\nIn REIN, I hope we can treasure what we lost and gained.\n\nArt to me can be the visualization of aesthetics or a mutually enjoyable creative process for you and me.\n\nOr like this time in REIN.\n\nA journey towards our room inside our heart shape box.",

            "description": "------------\nIntroduction\n------------\nArgentina is world-renowned for its exquisite wine, and the Malbec grape has long been a celebrated variety. While most of the country’s wine comes from the region of Cuyo, specifically the province of Mendoza, there is another hidden gem that is often overlooked: Entre Rios.\n\nNamed after the two massive rivers that surround it, Entre Rios is a province located in the northeast of Argentina. What many people don’t know is that it boasts a long and fascinating history of wine production that dates back to the early 19th century.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Entre Rios, I had the pleasure of exploring a small vineyard located near the Parana river. As I walked among the vines, I couldn’t help but feel inspired by their vibrant colors, intricate patterns of the leaves, and the beautiful clusters of grapes. It was clear to me that there was something truly special about the vineyards of Entre Rios.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the region’s history, I discovered that until 1937, Entre Rios was one of the largest wine producers in the country, with over 60 vineyards operating in the province. However, a national law was passed that year creating the Regulating Board of Wine, which concentrated and granted exclusivity to wine production in Cuyo. It wasn’t until 1993 that the law was repealed, allowing vineyards to be planted and modified throughout the country.\n\nToday, Entre Rios is home to a small but thriving wine industry that is known for its unique blends and varietals. One of the most notable grapes is the Tannat, which was once the predominant variety in the region.\n\nInspired by the beauty of these vineyards, I decided to create a generative art collection that celebrates the colors, shapes, and textures of the grapes and vines called ‘Lorda’.\n\n\n-----------\nAbout Lorda\n-----------\nTannat originates in southwest France (Madiran). However, it was not very admired there, so Tannat began its journey: it moved to our country, in the trunks of a Basque, Juan Jauregui, and settled in Entre Rios towards the end of the 1800s. This farmer nicknamed “El Lorda” planted Tannat in Concordia and managed to make a quite respectable wine. The grape took that nickname and became known as Lorda.\n\n\n-----\n\nPress \"e\" to save a high res png while in live mode.\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2023)\n\nMade with P5js and <3",
