            "description": "The idea for this project came from a common drawing exercise where different shapes and shading are used to create the illusion of depth. Here I'm using four layers containing various types of holes. Some are recognizable primitive shapes but others are organic in form or distorted. There are ten features reported that affect the character of each output.\n\nTo change the resolution:\n1. Click on the image\n2. Use the keys 2-8 to change resolution, '2' will produce a 2000 x 2000 image (default), '3' a 3000 x 3000 image etc\n3. Once generated press 'S' to save as a png\n\nJeff Clark\nDecember 2022\n--------------------------\nAll drawing and geometric code created by Jeff Clark using vanilla javascript except for:\n\n- perlin.js from https://codepen.io/sixsided/pen/emxxea.js\n",

It represents an attempt to capture some of the shapes, textures and nuances typical of hand-made drawings through algorithmic means. \n\nIt is a continuation of the exploration initiated with my previous work “The Likeness of a Flower”, a generator of expressionist flower paintings.\n\nStrongly inspired by the astonishing work of British artist Claudia Lowry: https://www.instagram.com/claudialowry_art/\n\n100% code – no assets. Made with p5.js.\nThis work is animated.\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 1000 x 1000 resolution.

            "description": "After 4 months of coding the Generative Glasses is ready! I gained a lot of experience along the way and I really liked the creation process.\n\nI wrote an article in which I report on the creation process in more detail. It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\n👓 thousands of different outputs are possible\n👨‍💻 only code\n🎨 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \n🎥 animated\n🖱️ interactive (+controls for mobile)\n😎 augmented reality view\n🟥 different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\n🖼️ save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\n📼 save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress “5” to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress “6” to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress “7” to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress “8” to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress “ArrowDown” for restores the original camera view\nPress “D” to switch to next composition\nPress “A” to switch  to previous composition\nPress “S” to start animation\nPress “Spacebar” to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress “1” to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress “2” to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress “3” to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention! Thanks for the support! Thanks for the opportunity fxhash and genart community! I hope I was able to contribute to generative art with my work!\n\n@C4RC0\ncarco.hu",
