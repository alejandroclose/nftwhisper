Now that I’m a part of your tez fam, please open me in live view, enter ‘9’ or ‘10’, wait, press ‘P’, print me, put me on your wall, and enjoy.\n__\n\nClew is a generative art collection designed for your wall.\n\nWhen opening live view, you’ll be prompted to choose a render quality (1 for lowest; 10 for highest). The higher quality renders are for printing and zooming in to choose your own sub-composition or explore the details/depth. Higher quality images will naturally take longer to render but will be worth the wait. If you find a partial render particularly nice, you can press spacebar to pause (and unpause) the render. Save a PNG by pressing ‘P’ or a JPEG with ‘J’. Medium and high quality renders are optimized for Chrome desktop and may not function on other browsers or mobile devices.\n\nThe processing length varies considerably, depending on the assigned traits. Therefore, not all previews will reflect the final output.\n\ncreated using p5js\n\nClew\nabstractment, 2022",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

Shamanic, mantra-like, willful, affirmations seek to map a desired direction. That is, until time and mind get in the way.  Within brief, passing moments, our minds are able to manifest conflicting wishes—and do so via declarative, convincing statements. \n \nThis work plays inside the chasm that divides intention and action. If we don’t know what we want, how can we act? Without the commitment of mind along the vast axis of time, our affirmations risk becoming sloganistic, simplistic, unrealistic—wavering proclamations that announce our vulnerability. \n \nKey words in these algorithmic affirmations shift over time to reflect the way our minds fluctuate. By shuffling words, this collection also explores our fluid relation to language. How to construct meaningful lives, when signification changes, moment to moment, within our minds? \n \nI WISH FOR THE METAVERSE TO RINSE OFF OF ME is a performance of fragility, which is where our humanity—and our beauty—abounds. \n\n-spacebar will pause the animation\n\n-return will resume the animation",

Now that I’m a part of your tez fam, please open me in live view, enter ‘9’ or ‘10’, wait, press ‘P’, print me, put me on your wall, and enjoy.\n__\n\nClew is a generative art collection designed for your wall.\n\nWhen opening live view, you’ll be prompted to choose a render quality (1 for lowest; 10 for highest). The higher quality renders are for printing and zooming in to choose your own sub-composition or explore the details/depth. Higher quality images will naturally take longer to render but will be worth the wait. If you find a partial render particularly nice, you can press spacebar to pause (and unpause) the render. Save a PNG by pressing ‘P’ or a JPEG with ‘J’. Medium and high quality renders are optimized for Chrome desktop and may not function on other browsers or mobile devices.\n\nThe processing length varies considerably, depending on the assigned traits. Therefore, not all previews will reflect the final output.\n\ncreated using p5js\n\nClew\nabstractment, 2022",

            "description": "When I was a kid I used to take apart broken electronic devices and look at the circuits, especially those with lots of good-sized components. As a scifi fan, I played with them imagining they were models of futuristic cities. For this piece I wanted to turn those memories of my childhood fantasies into glowing cyberpunk metropolises that resemble circuitry and are digital art made by computer circuits.\n\nOn the technical side, I used shaders to procedurally create the geometries and the textures. These geometries do not have vertex data like usual 3D, but are defined by mathematical functions, the so called \"implicit surfaces\". For each pixel a vector is constructed whose direction is used to make a simulated \"scanning ray\" that march step by step towards the scene, testing if it collides or not with any surface, and thus calculating the color that pixel should have. This technique is called raymarching and in this case the surface that defines the geometry is a height map.\n\nFor the procedural texture I used a formula that I discovered some years ago, a fractal of the kleinian family, in this case the square cousin version that produces patterns that look somewhat like circuits and that I have already used in other productions.\n\nFinally there is the post processing shader, for which I developed a noisy bloom effect and a depth of field algorithm that receives from the main shader the distance from the camera for each pixel using the alpha channel.\n\nThe variations are achieved with the parameters sent to the shader and used by the hash functions that set the position and shape of the buildings, the different perspectives, the colors and patterns of the procedural textures, and the gradient of the sky.\n\nBest viewed full screen. Also it will adapt to any aspect ratio.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nPress 'S' to save a 3840x2160 image (16:9) \nPress 'W' to save a 3840x1080 image (32:9)\n\nThis project is GPU demanding and not intended to be run on mobile devices or low end hardware. Specially high res image generation, that is likely to fail on low end GPU's.",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n“Southern Gothic” borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",
