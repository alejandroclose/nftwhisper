            "description": "Compartmentalization in service of clarity.\nDedicated to my Dad and, by extension, his advice.\n\nWhen I get overwhelmed (which is often), I typically call my dad. He’s always got some relatable story from his life I’ve never heard before, OR he hits me with the same piece of advice he’s been giving me for as long as I can remember:\n\n“Of course it’s hard to stay calm when you look at the pile in front of you. Every responsibility, want and obligation, is not something we’re meant to face all at once. Break it up, take on one task from the pile, and focus on that.”\n\nThis has been such a stable pattern that I often don’t need to hear him say it. I’ll finish describing what’s going on and stop him before he can even start, so he doesn’t have to waste his breath on something I should know by now, it’s already helping just to remember it.\n\nThe best thing I can do for myself is to pick something out of the pile and handle it in isolation. I find that often each task will grow the pile exponentially. It’s easy to handle my health and fitness when that’s all I have to think about. But then I have to think about finances, maintaining friendships, taking care of my plants, dating, and finding time for a hobby. Each one of those things has its own nuances and complications. With all that in mind, going to the gym sounds overwhelming.\n\nBut— Going to the gym is easy. Pick one thing, focus, get it done, and watch the pile shrink. Repeat.\n\nI’ve opted to create a design which illustrates this overwhelm and demonstrates how quickly those individual tasks lose form in the pile.\n\nPress 's' to save a .png\nPress '1', '2', or '3' to change render size\nPress 't' to toggle linen texture (for use printing onto textured paper or cloth)\n\nCreated by Chris McCully in October 2023 using p5.js, chroma.js, and GLSL",

            "description": "Step into the vibrant world of FXHash 2, where art meets innovation! This piece of art is a tribute to the launch, inviting you to immerse yourself in its dynamic visuals.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the realm of the lines, there rested a world overlooked by the atmospheric views of hills, christened as Harmonious Hill. A world, where the sun, the moon, and the stars were born out of infinite circles effortlessly looping. A world that was bathed utterly in monochrome hues of the cosmic palette.\n\nIt was once teeming with life, laughter, and colors before the great apocalypse. A disaster so colossal, that it wiped out all color, replacing it with an eternal melancholy of black and white.\n\nThe Harmonious Hill, though stripped of its vibrancy, stood resiliently against time. The skies were filled with perpetual fog, a reminder of the long-lost days. The vertical and curvy hills, once gliding into vibrant valleys, now housed derelict and deserted towns.\n\nThe Taiga trees, bound by the monochrome, delineated themselves as large silhouettes against the never-ending horizontal line of the sky, whispering tales of the catastrophic past to the lonely artists. The haunting echoes of the past continued to reverberate, ironically absorbed by these mute trees.\n\nAmid the somber monotones, the lone survivors were the birds. Soaring across the gloomy apartment buildings, their elegiac songs spun tales of lost epochs in the cold air, threading through the silent trees and melancholy fog.\n\nOne day, a new phenomenon graced the hills. The everyday circle loop of the sun enlarged, as though trying to consume the sullen world. Fear encapsulated the folks of the Harmonious Hill as they watched the sun spiral, assuming it to be the second apocalypse in line.\n\nIn the foreboding silence, a tiny speck of white emerged from the enormous sun, descending to the sky. As it journeyed closer, the birds serenaded its descent. It was a seed, glowing white and vibrant against the black skies.\n\nUpon reaching the cold ground, it burrowed into the heart of Harmonious Hill. Silence fell once more; the sun receded to its normal loop. Days turned into nights, and nights into days.\n\nThen, in the stillness of a frosty dawn, the seed burst forth from the ice-cold soil. A majestic tree, unlike any Taiga trees, flourished. It sprouted not just leaves, but colors. Colors of hope, resilience, and rejuvenation. It shone vibrantly, piercing through the eternal fog.\n\nThe birds sang, and their melodies turned from dirges to ditties of joy. The people in the houses awoken from their centuries-old slumber, stepping out for the first time into the fresh, thawing world. As they saw the growing tree of colors, they weaved stories of a new beginning, a world reborn.\n\nIn the realm of lines and monochromes, the world of Harmonious Hill thus welcomed hope, banishing its perpetual sadness into a tale of survival and rebirth. The apocalypse became a fable of transcendence, of how desolate lives could burgeon anew, in the miraculous world of art.\n\nTo navigate and interact with the artwork, here are the key controls:\n\nS Key: Press 'S' to save the image content of the current frame.

Intrigued by this challenge, I've delved deep into the pixels of this issue. 🙂\n\nDrawing inspiration from Rev Dan Catt’s 'Tally!' and applying similar principles of Cable Management, I've assembled a fun and free OE project.\n\nThis project dynamically evolves with each iteration.Grid is determined by a random value calculated as follows: the lower bound starts at 3 and increases incrementally with every 100 iterations, while the upper bound starts at 4 and increases with every 30 iterations. In practical terms, as the iteration count increases, both the minimum and maximum possible number of cols&rows gradually increase.\n\n3200x3200px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

Inspired by the ethereal interplay between dreams and reality, this masterpiece conjures flowers that dwell not in earthly gardens but in the imagination's boundless fields.\n\nEach bloom, a digital mirage, mirrors the complexity of human perception, capturing the myriad souls in its petals. Here, flowers are not merely seen; they are felt, as they embody the diverse essences of life, painted in strokes of unseen colors and shapes.\n\n\"The Soul of Flowers\" is a digital garden where each flower narrates its own poetic story, a fusion of art and technology that invites viewers to wander through a realm of beauty, redefining the boundaries between the virtual and the real.",

Here, flowers are not merely seen; they are felt, as they embody the diverse essences of life, painted in strokes of unseen colors and shapes.\n\n\"The Soul of Flowers\" is a digital garden where each flower narrates its own poetic story, a fusion of art and technology that invites viewers to wander through a realm of beauty, redefining the boundaries between the virtual and the real.",

Inspired by the ethereal interplay between dreams and reality, this masterpiece conjures flowers that dwell not in earthly gardens but in the imagination's boundless fields.\n\nEach bloom, a digital mirage, mirrors the complexity of human perception, capturing the myriad souls in its petals. Here, flowers are not merely seen; they are felt, as they embody the diverse essences of life, painted in strokes of unseen colors and shapes.\n\n\"The Soul of Flowers\" is a digital garden where each flower narrates its own poetic story, a fusion of art and technology that invites viewers to wander through a realm of beauty, redefining the boundaries between the virtual and the real.",

Intrigued by this challenge, I've delved deep into the pixels of this issue. 🙂\n\nDrawing inspiration from Rev Dan Catt’s 'Tally!' and applying similar principles of Cable Management, I've assembled a fun and free OE project.\n\nThis project dynamically evolves with each iteration.Grid is determined by a random value calculated as follows: the lower bound starts at 3 and increases incrementally with every 100 iterations, while the upper bound starts at 4 and increases with every 30 iterations. In practical terms, as the iteration count increases, both the minimum and maximum possible number of cols&rows gradually increase.\n\n3200x3200px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",
