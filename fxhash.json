And while we devise systems for solving unfathomably complex problems, generating algorithmic creativity, and unlocking regenerative biological possibilities, we simultaneously cling to the power and originality of emotional feeling – believing it to be the irreplaceable source of what makes us human.\n\nIf the body is our shell for emotion and soul, can an artificial humanoid be another vessel for these thoughts and feelings – for human essence itself? If our ‘soul’ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable? That we may see answers to these questions looks more real every year, and is perhaps a little frightening. \n\nEmotional Shell uses introspective portraits of future selves to question what it means to be human, when the people around us are no longer human.\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 1-3 to select from low, medium, and high quality settings\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2400px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nTENDER x wwatkns\nAugust 2022",

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

With each iteration appears a new densely built city block. Graced with impeccable geometrical lines, devoid of any human presence, these buildings remind us of brutalist utopias like Le Corbusier’s Cité radieuse or Niemeyer’s Brasilia. But despite their clearly modernist feel, there is something hauntingly primitive about them. They could be either New Mexican adobe pueblos, Minoan palaces, or Turkish troglodyte dwellings. Both carved and sculpted, these Ghormenghasts of concrete float in a realm out of time, like in some architect’s dream.\n\nThe purpose of this creative work is to generate 3D architectural projects that could be implemented in the real world. The accelerating lives that we live, complicated by growing and unpredictable environmental crises, call for an enhanced capacity to come up quickly with new architectural solutions adapted to different contexts. From computer assisted design to 3D printing, from augmented reality to real-life housing, from sculpture to architecture, this work aims at bridging the gap between the virtual and the tangible.\n\nWorking as a visual artist, David Umemoto draws inspiration from his training as an architect. He has been using low-tech methods for a long time, refining his talent for elegant simple shapes and combinatory constructions. Now, poured concrete and home-made moulds are giving way to zero-gravity rotating models. The skills he developed while working with real objects find a new playground in the virtual realm.\n",

            "description": "All of our strong emotions, feelings and experiences come from childhood. Sincere happiness or frightening cruelty is primarily inherent in children, so they learn about the world. When we were children, we first hurt someone, first burst into tears from resentment, learned what is good and what is bad. \nOur parents did not answer our questions, either because they did not know the answer or because they thought we were too young. We learned to look for the answers ourselves. Whoever says that children don't understand is a fool. They do understand, but they do it in their own way. The world as seen through the eyes of a child is not like the world as seen through the eyes of an adult. It is often not built on the laws of physics or the laws of the marketplace. In a child's world or universe, the moon is just a little light in the sky, and the next street is already a different country. Their world is built on speculation and magical theories. Unfortunately, a child's world is not eternal. As they grow up, the \"real\" life, the life of adults, pokes into them like a sharp needle over and over again. \nThere is something incredibly tragic about this time gap between child and adult. It is this period that I wanted to trace in my work. As teenagers, it is as if we are between two trains, we are no longer children, but we are not yet adults. We get to know ourselves, we test our strength and readiness to exist in the \"real\" world. We are trying to find our place in the unfriendly world of adults, but we are also not ready to let go of the magic of childhood. It confuses, torments, and frustrates us. But it is a necessary and unavoidable tragedy. \n\nCode by PureSpider",

And while we devise systems for solving unfathomably complex problems, generating algorithmic creativity, and unlocking regenerative biological possibilities, we simultaneously cling to the power and originality of emotional feeling – believing it to be the irreplaceable source of what makes us human.\n\nIf the body is our shell for emotion and soul, can an artificial humanoid be another vessel for these thoughts and feelings – for human essence itself? If our ‘soul’ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable? That we may see answers to these questions looks more real every year, and is perhaps a little frightening. \n\nEmotional Shell uses introspective portraits of future selves to question what it means to be human, when the people around us are no longer human.\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 1-3 to select from low, medium, and high quality settings\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2400px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nTENDER x wwatkns\nAugust 2022",

What we think is artificial is but nature's inclination.\n\nAs an atom gazes at the world it can see the arrogant hand of mankind imposing its will. We are nature's inane creation built from imperceptible, discrete particles.\n\nEnjoy watching the structures form. Due to the nature of the system it may take some time to complete.

Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "Polar Grid is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, London 2022.\n\nThis is a study of color, motion, and composition, and an homage to cinema as an artform. Colorful shapes overlap and pulse in a ever repeating dance. An abstracted movie experience. Each color palette in the series (except one) is inspired by a different film director (if you want a real challenge, see how many you can guess without looking at the feature names).\n\nThe palettes were extracted from movie stills or movie posters and fine tuned by hand. As often, I have to thank independent tool makers for their indirect help. My gratitude goes to David Aerne for FarbVélo and Fabrizio Bianchi for Coolors.\n\nThe code for Polar Grid is based on early iterations of what ultimately became my carat series. Both projects come from the same fascination for color as a system, even though I used a different approach here. You could call this a carat prequel.\n\nThe animation is done using a technique called polar noise. This makes it so the motion of all elements ends up repeating in the same amount of time. This is useful for generating motion that loops perfectly while still appearing organic. In this particular case, the animation repeats every π × 100 seconds.\n\nA challenge in building any generative system is to find the right balance between coherence and variety. I designed the system with the large edition size in mind. During development I generated hundreds of iterations and tweaked my code to make sure that every iteration is truly unique and fits the overall aesthetic of the collection.\n\nI truly hope you will enjoy your own little abstract movie.\n\n— Raphaël de Courville\n\n\nReleased: July 6th 2022\n\nMedium: p5.js, html canvas, css\n\nReference: sk220621\n\n\n**About the artist**\n\nRaphaël de Courville is a generative artist, streamer, and educator.
