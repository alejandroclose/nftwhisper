            "description": "CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG is an homage to Ohne Titel (1969‚Äì1970) by Verena Loewensberg.\n\n2 of 5 in CENTURY-XXX, Series 2\nEdition of 128\n\nCENTURY-XXX is a series of software sketches that pay tribute to artists of the 20th century. Each piece is named after a specific artist and reimagines one of their original works through code, often by adding motion, variation, or interactive elements. These sketches don‚Äôt replicate the original artworks but instead extend their core ideas into new forms.\n\nBy ‚Äúsoftware sketch,‚Äù I mean something more informal than a finished artwork. While some of my projects take months or even years to complete, these sketches are created quickly‚Äîoften in just a few days. They may be lighter in process, but they‚Äôre equally important to me. Sketching with code is how I think through ideas and discover new directions for future work.\n\nThe project began with the CENTURY exhibition at DAM Projects in Berlin in fall 2012, where I premiered Network C, Network D, and the first Signal to Noise software piece. Since then, these sketches have inspired more full-scale artworks like METASOTO, METAVASARELY, METAMOLNAR (also known as Hommage √† Molnar), including the eponymous CENTURY released through Art Blocks in June 2021.\n\nCENTURY-XXX Series 1 was released from December 2021 to January 2022 in editions of 1,000. The first artwork in Series 2 followed in October 2022, also in an edition of 1,000. The remaining four works in Series 2 are scheduled for release starting in 2025, each in smaller editions of fewer than 128 based on what feels appropriate for the individual piece.\n\nThe long-term vision for CENTURY-XXX is to create 100 software sketches, each one inspired by a different artist and artwork from the 20th century.\n\nSERIES 1\n1.1 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METAMETAMALEVICH\n1.2 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METAMOLNAR(S)\n1.3 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METAMORELLET\n1.4 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METARILEY\n1.5 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METAKELLY\n\nSERIES 2\n2.1 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE\n2.2 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG\n\nMore CENTURY-XXX‚Äôs to come‚Ä¶",

            "description": "Toccata is a piece about decay, about the impermanent. The emergence over time or, rather, progression of entropy is a key characteristic of our universe. Everything evolves to nothing. We as mortal beings have sometimes trouble reconciling with this idea. Humans have sought immortality for millennia, be it through ancient potions or modern medicine, be it from leaving a legacy that we feel will stand the test of time. It will, only to decay later than us.\n\nToccata is a piece about change. Change lies at the heart of human cognition and human nature. Our thoughts and our emotions happen over time, and are a function of the change that is both around us and at the very core of our selves. Change comes in nature in cycles. Seasons of growth, seasons of ripe fruits of life, seasons of decay, of death, rebirth.\n\nToccata is music. We find music to convey some of the deepest streams of human condition, connecting it to some other form of being. Music also happens over time, and music happens because of change. Music encodes our feelings better than any other aid we may have. Toccata incorporates this at its very core, as the main sound is Andreas' family piano where he learned to play, sampled this past July.\n\nRead more about the piece, and the collaboration between Marcelo and Andreas on andreasrau.eu/toccata\n\n---\n\nBasic controls:\n- Click on the piece or press spacebar to start it (WebAudio requires user intervention for the music to start). Once the music has started, again click or press spacebar to play/pause.\n- Press ‚Äús‚Äù to save a still at the current resolution\n- Press ‚Äúr‚Äù to start recording a video at the current resolution, then ‚Äúr‚Äù again to stop.\n\n---\n\nWebM audio-video recording performed using the library RecordRTC by https://muazkhan.com/, MIT licence.",

            "description": "Richter is the second collaboration of Richard Nadler and Leander Herzog, following their first project called Gerhard. A generative animation based on multiple layers of color and data, mixed, moved and painted over in realtime. Some fragments stick to the canvas while others get discarded to leave the existing layers visible, allowing a complex surface to emerge and build up over time.\n \nRichter works with data from 4 of 24 highres images, 30mb in total. This is the maximum size fxhash allows for a project and three times more than Gerhard. Richard Nadler created stunning new textures, enabling more variation in composition and detail to emerge at much higher resolution. Leander Herzog created the code for the interplay between the layers, motion and interactions. Richter elevates the approach from Gerhard with new methods for the realtime rendering process and new features like offline-first caching. Both artists use different tools and are not aware of the details of each others process, meeting through the interface of pixels as data.\n \nRichter is featured in the exhibition \"Generative Abstraction\" at Expanded.art in Berlin.\n \n- Click to start a new layer of motion and color.\n- Doubleclick to enter fullscreen.\n- Press ‚Äús‚Äù to save the canvas.\n- Append ?dpr=4 to the url to increase the resolution.\n\nleanderherzog.ch/2023/richter/\nleanderherzog.ch/2022/gerhard/\nfxhash.xyz/generative/17030/",

In a larger context this work aims to reveal emergent aesthetics on interferences of abstract nature.\n\n's' saves the image.",

These sketches don‚Äôt replicate the original artworks but instead extend their core ideas into new forms.\n\nBy ‚Äúsoftware sketch,‚Äù I mean something more informal than a finished artwork.

The remaining four works in Series 2 are scheduled for release starting in 2025, each in smaller editions of fewer than 128 based on what feels appropriate for the individual piece.\n\nThe long-term vision for CENTURY-XXX is to create 100 software sketches, each one inspired by a different artist and artwork from the 20th century.\n\nSERIES 1\n1.1 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METAMETAMALEVICH\n1.2 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METAMOLNAR(S)\n1.3 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METAMORELLET\n1.4 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METARILEY\n1.5 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METAKELLY\n\nSERIES 2\n2.1 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE\n2.2 ‚Äî CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG\n\nMore CENTURY-XXX‚Äôs to come‚Ä¶",

            "description": "Each day at 2 pm, humanity‚Äôs demand for ecological resources exceeds what earth can regenerate that day. After 2 pm, we live on future generation's expense. This artwork changes to an expressionist version once the overshoot moment has passed, day by day.\n\nThis project closes the feedback loop between lifestyle and environmental impact. 10 countries are featured with their individual overshoot moment. In Australia, the resources are completely consumed at 5 am in the morning. In Thailand, the earth‚Äôs ecological limits are reached at about 4 pm. \n\nThe data is based on the Earth Overshoot Day which is hosted and calculated by Global Footprint Network, an international research organization.
