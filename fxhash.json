            "description": "Square Planets was inspired by a series of OP Art paintings done by Victor Vasarely, called Planetary Folklore Participations No. 2. (c. 1970). Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the third in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nSquare Planets consists of four layers of squares contained within a background square superimposed on top of one another. Each layer is translated from the previous layer but still lies within its boundaries. The background color of each layer is random and its set of squares are another random color. The squares that make up layers two and three are rotated either clockwise or counter-clockwise some random number of degrees within a predetermined range. \n\nThere are many Gestalt interactions within this piece. Layers (square planets) interact with each other in interesting ways. Each new generation with its random color assignments significantly affect your depth perception. Layers appear to come forward or recede. Sometimes there is more \"after-imagism\" between the square sets. Candy for your mind.",

            "description": "\"Herbarium\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022\n\nOccasionally, I stumble upon vintage scientific illustrations on various topics, exotically looking charts and graphs, alternative layouts for the periodic tables or psychological research diagrams, elaborate illustrations of botany and zoology, minerals, and natural and sometimes unnatural phenomena. Most of those illustrations are part of the \"art and science\" practices from the 18th and 19th centuries. At the core of those practices were observation and interpretation, unraveling complexity through visualizing abstract ideas or finding a creative approach for understanding previously incomprehensible forms. \n\nI'm an admirer of two female pioneers in the field. Maria Sibylla Merian created, with immense dedication, a book with intricate illustrations of plants and insects, later praised by scientists. On the other hand, Anna Atkins published a book with beautiful botanical cyanotypes, considered the first book with photographic images. These topics are the visual inspiration for pieces presented at ArtBasel HK. \n\nMy mathematical background makes me naturally attracted to graphs, converting numbers to curves, and everything schematically displayed. Also, combining scientific symbols and illustrations with imaginary data inspires the spectator to find meaning in unrelated or random things or provokes latent skepticism towards assumed concepts of truth, reality, and knowledge.

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "BRIDGE is a collaborative project for fx(hash), conceived by Camille Roux. The project was announced on Twitter on Feb. 7, 2022 [1]. Artists were given two weeks to contribute code that would draw tiles representing a bridge, in their own style. Artists were free to implement their own artistic vision, subject to one simple constraint: Respect the coordinates of the tiles for each iteration of the art. \n\nEach iteration has a default style determined randomly at mint. This style is named in the features and displayed in the thumbnail. However, each iteration includes all styles, and you can cycle through them by clicking on or touching the image. Styles will be shown in the order in which they are listed under INCLUDED STYLES.\n\nPress \"s\" to save a screenshot.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nI'm Camille Roux. I planned to do a lot of collab this year with fx(hash) artists I like, but it takes too much time, or maybe I like too many artists :) Some days ago, I woke up with this idea in mind: \"Hey! What if I make a collaboration with all the artists I like at once!\" This is how the BRIDGE project was born.\n\nMoreover, I love the mutual aid and solidarity between fx(hash) generative artists. The BRIDGE can be seen as a symbol of the link between us ♥️.\n\nThe project has also served as an inspiration for participants to extend and develop their coding skills outside their usual areas of interest. The code for the entire project remains available on GitHub [2].\n\nTHE INCLUDED STYLES\n\nText-to-Bridge (TTB) by Ada Ada Ada\nhttps://twitter.com/ada_ada_ada_art\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ada%20Ada%20Ada\n\nBlest Path by Anaglyphic\nhttps://twitter.com/anaglyph_ic\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/anaglyphic\n\nThe Old Woody Dock by Aqw_Zert\nhttps://twitter.com/Aqw_Zert\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Aqw_Zert\n\nBridge-Tunnel by Laurent Houdard\nhttps://twitter.com/CablesAndPixels\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Laurent%20Houdard\n\nEvaporating by Camille Roux\nhttps://twitter.com/camillerouxart\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Camille%20Roux\n\nBuildings by Camille Roux\nhttps://twitter.com/camillerouxart\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Camille%20Roux\n\nTGH Bridge by David Esq\nhttps://twitter.com/emcyze\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/David%20Esq\n\nCitadel by devnull\nhttps://twitter.com/lostpunks\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/devnull\n\nEinstein–Rosen by Elsif\nhttps://twitter.com/ElsifThen\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/elsif\n\nPath through the city by Estienne\nhttps://twitter.com/Estienne_ca\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Estienne\n\nstarry night//glitchy night by frederative\nhttps://twitter.com/frederative\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/frederative\n\nBlackboard by Generative Pen\nhttps://twitter.com/GenerativePen\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Generative%20Pen\n\nMozaik by Gorik\nhttps://twitter.com/gorikfr\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Gorik\n\nDevour by grosgg\nhttps://twitter.com/rosgg\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/grosgg\n\nburning bridges by jeres\nhttps://twitter.com/heyjeres\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/jeres\n\nSpace Disco Dancefloor by Julien Labat\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienLabat\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/julabat\n\n/nt/r/t///a/ by lunarean\nhttps://twitter.com/lunarean\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/lunarean\n\nNara by Makio64\nhttps://twitter.com/makio64\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Makio64\n\nBifrost by mandyBrigwell\nhttps://twitter.com/mandybrigwell\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/mandybrigwell\n\nRain under the stars by Matt Circles\nhttps://twitter.com/matt_circles\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Matt%20Circles\n\nEsoteric Oasis by Nick Dima\nhttps://twitter.com/nickdima\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Nick%20Dima\n\nStreet Lights by phil_osophie\nhttps://twitter.com/phil_osophie\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/phil_osophie\n\nRise by Robin Metcalfe\nhttps://twitter.com/solarise_webdev\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Robin\n\nFlower Bridge by RVig\nhttps://twitter.com/rvig_art\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/rvig\n\nhere comes the sun by shuhblam\nhttps://twitter.com/shuhblam\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/shuhblam\n\nInto another world by Claus O.

            "description": "\"Mythologic\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nMythologic is a project derived from cloud series, Cloud Atlas and Requiem: Cloud on fxhash. In the series, lines and circles are used in an organics movement like Cloud Hands, which is a move of Tai Chi. Practitioners move their hands slowly and smoothly, make circles and rotate with extreme concentrating. In Chinese we said “floating clouds and flowing water” to describe calligraphers’ freely flowing style of writing. Chi is a very important for oriental artists, and for genart as well. In the series, lines and circles start from one position to another, and develop with organic rotations and movements, like practicing Tai Chi on the canvas. \n\nMythologic was inspired from “Classic of Mountains and Seas”, also known as Shan Hai Jing, is a Chinese classic text and a compilation of mythic geography and beasts. \n\n“There is a beast that looks like a fox with nine tails.” \n“Huangbei: it is a beetle with meat like a tadpole, but with a head and a tail” \n“The beast has the body of a fish but the wings of a bird” \n\nThere are many incredible creatures in the text which describe the oriental fantasy. The idea of Mythologic is to present an illustrated handbook with random generated paintings, each one is like a framed badge, to memorize the glorious age. It uses the \"cloud hands\" technique in every parts of this piece, the center, the circle and the frame. They are all the same algorithm but perform variety with different density and components.

There is a legend in the East that before Pan Gu opened up the sky and created the earth, the world was a chaotic place, and no one knew its appearance. And I have always been fascinated by this mythical story since he was a child.\n\nThese three works have a father-son relationship, Research > Memory > Culture, with each work re-growing through the remnants of the previous work, depending on its image. From the beginning of the creative coding, I like the concept of recursion the most. Here I experiment with my central thinking through this iterative relationship so that the work is not only the shadow of the artist but also the pulling force of repetition.\n\n\"混沌\" Chaos in Eastern culture represents the initial state of things. This state is consistent with what we believe in generative art: Anything can happen if different forces are applied. Letting chaos grow out of order and then destroying it, the iterative process, is like my usual dialogue with myself, and maybe it's all just a diary.\n\nThrough these three series of works, whether I can eventually find everything in my childhood fantasy, I am not sure yet. The only thing I can be sure of is that I will continue to explore.\n\n- Click the mouse to save an artwork.\n- Collectors who own this NFT have the right to print the work.\n\nArtist: Aluan Wang (ileivoivm).\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "\"Herbarium\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022\n\nOccasionally, I stumble upon vintage scientific illustrations on various topics, exotically looking charts and graphs, alternative layouts for the periodic tables or psychological research diagrams, elaborate illustrations of botany and zoology, minerals, and natural and sometimes unnatural phenomena. Most of those illustrations are part of the \"art and science\" practices from the 18th and 19th centuries. At the core of those practices were observation and interpretation, unraveling complexity through visualizing abstract ideas or finding a creative approach for understanding previously incomprehensible forms. \n\nI'm an admirer of two female pioneers in the field. Maria Sibylla Merian created, with immense dedication, a book with intricate illustrations of plants and insects, later praised by scientists. On the other hand, Anna Atkins published a book with beautiful botanical cyanotypes, considered the first book with photographic images. These topics are the visual inspiration for pieces presented at ArtBasel HK. \n\nMy mathematical background makes me naturally attracted to graphs, converting numbers to curves, and everything schematically displayed. Also, combining scientific symbols and illustrations with imaginary data inspires the spectator to find meaning in unrelated or random things or provokes latent skepticism towards assumed concepts of truth, reality, and knowledge.
