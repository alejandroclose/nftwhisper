            "description": "Direction determination refers to the ways in which a cardinal direction can be determined in navigation and wayfinding. The most direct method is using a compass, but indirect methods exist, based on the sun, the moon, the stars. It helped humans to explore the world as we know it.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'Cardinal directions' is inspired by minimalism and express natural human predisposition to explore the world. Our curiosity led as to where we are now. We explored the nature that surrounds us and were able to adapt to various circumstances. We overcome difficulties and used it to our favor.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe collection consists of 4 different geographical areas - mountains, woods, seas and plains. Each area has its own unique element - a monument created by humans as a symbol of how we adapt in different places.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeographical areas: Mountains, Woods, Seas, Plains;\nMonuments: Castles, Watch Towers, Lighthouses, Windmills;\nDaytime: Day, Night;\nMoon phase: Full, Waxing, Waning;\nWeather: Dusky, Cloudy, Clear;\nSky objects: Stars, Shooting Star, Birds;\nLegendary creature: Sea Snake (Rare).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResolution: 2000x2000 px\nPress [s] to download the piece as a png file\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Feb 2023\nArtist: Jidoari",

            "description": "\"Garden, Monoliths\" is the result of an algorithm that started in April 2021. It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

Franke, a pioneer of computer art, passed away on July 16, 2022 at the age of 95. CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE is an homage to Franke’s MONDRIAN software developed for the Texas Instruments TI 99/4 home computer in 1979, and it’s a fundraiser to digitize his archive:\n\n“Our goal is to raise 20,000 Euro so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. If we raise more money, it will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.” \n\nEach frame, a single “pixel” is added to the CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE image. When the software first loads, 100,000 frames are run in the background to start things off. Keep it running for hours or days to see it transform entirely — it’s an “infinite animation.”",

            "description": "Each monogrid artwork gets initialized with a start up algorithm that builds up a set of rectangles and fills them with pixels. There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",
