            "description": "This project is about the exploration of chaotic structures created with lines and blurry silhouettes. They work together to make the shapes emerge without revealing them completely and create dark and light areas that compose a feeling of depth and weight to the scene.\n\nSome pieces are chaotic, some more ordered. Some have strong compositions, some don't. By zooming in on the details we can let our mind wander and start seeing shapes.\n\nBest experienced in full-screen.\n\nPress S to take a screenshot\nPress M to take a high resolution screenshot\nPress H to take a higher resolution screenshot (may not work for some devices)\n\nWARNING: Project is using webgl, it may not work on some older devices.\n\nOriginal artwork by William Watkins · Lyon, 2022",

            "description": "Inspired by traditional Japanese wagami design. We use the iconic patterns of our previous projects to recreate this artwork. All the patterns are generated first and then used to build the scene. \n\nIn this project Aluan brings his delicate texture from his 'Chaos' series, Jinyao brings his beloved pattern from the 'Cloud' series and Wen brings his iconic pattern from the 'Maze'. 'Collage' is not just about mixing our style, but it is also about finding harmony among all the elements. 'Collage' is also about working together, in that we can create something that's difficult to achieve or imagine if we were working alone.\n\nEach piece contains the patterns of all the 3 artists, each artist has a certain number of patterns with different colors. Depending which artist you get, his pattern will be shown as the primary color theme while the pattern of the other 2 artists turns into grayscale to make the primary pattern with color stand out. \n\nThere are 7 different scenes included in this project, which are : Mountains, Waves, Lake, Hexagons, Tetrapods, Chrysanthemums and Lotus. We took great inspiration from the traditional Japanese design, and we discovered these are some of the most common elements in it. Therefore we decide to use them and reimagine them by mixing our patterns. \n\nThe title 'Collage' doesn't only apply to the visual style, but also to the code as well. In this project we mixed p5.js and Vanilla JS. While Aluan and Jinyao work with their patterns in p5. Wen gathered the patterns and recreated the full scene in Vanilla JS.\n",

Like any particle, the individual can only be fully aware of his own existence and path.\n\nYou are surrounded by people. On the scale there are over seven billion people around you. Most of them you do not know and will never know. Just as you don't think about every drop in the sea, you don't think about the existence of each individual person. A person is not in your own world until he/she/they etc. touches it. But, just as in the current of the sea you may come across a sharp stone or the most beautiful pearl, so in the mass of people you may come across that stranger.\nHe is a constant variable. You can't recognize him among the faceless landscape until he stands at the edge of your world. At the same time, his figure is sacred and not accidental. You were meant to meet him, and he was meant to meet you.\nThe Stranger has a gift for you. He can show you what the future holds, or answer questions that have long tormented you. \nThis moment is a second before you meet your personal stranger.\nWhere will you meet him? Will he scare you or charm you? What gift will he give you and why? What will he predict for you?\nThis will be your personal story. Whether you want to tell it or keep it to yourself is up to you.\n\n\nCode by PureSpider",

            "description": "Inspired by traditional Japanese wagami design. We use the iconic patterns of our previous projects to recreate this artwork. All the patterns are generated first and then used to build the scene. \n\nIn this project Aluan brings his delicate texture from his 'Chaos' series, Jinyao brings his beloved pattern from the 'Cloud' series and Wen brings his iconic pattern from the 'Maze'. 'Collage' is not just about mixing our style, but it is also about finding harmony among all the elements. 'Collage' is also about working together, in that we can create something that's difficult to achieve or imagine if we were working alone.\n\nEach piece contains the patterns of all the 3 artists, each artist has a certain number of patterns with different colors. Depending which artist you get, his pattern will be shown as the primary color theme while the pattern of the other 2 artists turns into grayscale to make the primary pattern with color stand out. \n\nThere are 7 different scenes included in this project, which are : Mountains, Waves, Lake, Hexagons, Tetrapods, Chrysanthemums and Lotus. We took great inspiration from the traditional Japanese design, and we discovered these are some of the most common elements in it. Therefore we decide to use them and reimagine them by mixing our patterns. \n\nThe title 'Collage' doesn't only apply to the visual style, but also to the code as well. In this project we mixed p5.js and Vanilla JS. While Aluan and Jinyao work with their patterns in p5. Wen gathered the patterns and recreated the full scene in Vanilla JS.\n",

All the patterns are generated first and then used to build the scene. \n\nIn this project Aluan brings his delicate texture from his 'Chaos' series, Jinyao brings his beloved pattern from the 'Cloud' series and Wen brings his iconic pattern from the 'Maze'. 'Collage' is not just about mixing our style, but it is also about finding harmony among all the elements. 'Collage' is also about working together, in that we can create something that's difficult to achieve or imagine if we were working alone.\n\nEach piece contains the patterns of all the 3 artists, each artist has a certain number of patterns with different colors. Depending which artist you get, his pattern will be shown as the primary color theme while the pattern of the other 2 artists turns into grayscale to make the primary pattern with color stand out. \n\nThere are 7 different scenes included in this project, which are : Mountains, Waves, Lake, Hexagons, Tetrapods, Chrysanthemums and Lotus. We took great inspiration from the traditional Japanese design, and we discovered these are some of the most common elements in it. Therefore we decide to use them and reimagine them by mixing our patterns. \n\nThe title 'Collage' doesn't only apply to the visual style, but also to the code as well. In this project we mixed p5.js and Vanilla JS. While Aluan and Jinyao work with their patterns in p5. Wen gathered the patterns and recreated the full scene in Vanilla JS.\n",

            "description": "Inspired by traditional Japanese wagami design. We use the iconic patterns of our previous projects to recreate this artwork. All the patterns are generated first and then used to build the scene. \n\nIn this project Aluan brings his delicate texture from his 'Chaos' series, Jinyao brings his beloved pattern from the 'Cloud' series and Wen brings his iconic pattern from the 'Maze'. 'Collage' is not just about mixing our style, but it is also about finding harmony among all the elements. 'Collage' is also about working together, in that we can create something that's difficult to achieve or imagine if we were working alone.\n\nEach piece contains the patterns of all the 3 artists, each artist has a certain number of patterns with different colors. Depending which artist you get, his pattern will be shown as the primary color theme while the pattern of the other 2 artists turns into grayscale to make the primary pattern with color stand out. \n\nThere are 7 different scenes included in this project, which are : Mountains, Waves, Lake, Hexagons, Tetrapods, Chrysanthemums and Lotus. We took great inspiration from the traditional Japanese design, and we discovered these are some of the most common elements in it. Therefore we decide to use them and reimagine them by mixing our patterns. \n\nThe title 'Collage' doesn't only apply to the visual style, but also to the code as well. In this project we mixed p5.js and Vanilla JS. While Aluan and Jinyao work with their patterns in p5. Wen gathered the patterns and recreated the full scene in Vanilla JS.\n",

All the patterns are generated first and then used to build the scene. \n\nIn this project Aluan brings his delicate texture from his 'Chaos' series, Jinyao brings his beloved pattern from the 'Cloud' series and Wen brings his iconic pattern from the 'Maze'. 'Collage' is not just about mixing our style, but it is also about finding harmony among all the elements. 'Collage' is also about working together, in that we can create something that's difficult to achieve or imagine if we were working alone.\n\nEach piece contains the patterns of all the 3 artists, each artist has a certain number of patterns with different colors. Depending which artist you get, his pattern will be shown as the primary color theme while the pattern of the other 2 artists turns into grayscale to make the primary pattern with color stand out. \n\nThere are 7 different scenes included in this project, which are : Mountains, Waves, Lake, Hexagons, Tetrapods, Chrysanthemums and Lotus. We took great inspiration from the traditional Japanese design, and we discovered these are some of the most common elements in it. Therefore we decide to use them and reimagine them by mixing our patterns. \n\nThe title 'Collage' doesn't only apply to the visual style, but also to the code as well. In this project we mixed p5.js and Vanilla JS. While Aluan and Jinyao work with their patterns in p5. Wen gathered the patterns and recreated the full scene in Vanilla JS.\n",

They work together to make the shapes emerge without revealing them completely and create dark and light areas that compose a feeling of depth and weight to the scene.\n\nSome pieces are chaotic, some more ordered. Some have strong compositions, some don't. By zooming in on the details we can let our mind wander and start seeing shapes.\n\nBest experienced in full-screen.\n\nPress S to take a screenshot\nPress M to take a high resolution screenshot\nPress H to take a higher resolution screenshot (may not work for some devices)\n\nWARNING: Project is using webgl, it may not work on some older devices.\n\nOriginal artwork by William Watkins · Lyon, 2022",
