            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution. I tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge / Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iPhone, but please make sure it works on your device before minting.\n\n-----\n\nPossible features:\n\ncolor scheme: cairngorm, alborz, bardenas, atlas, bieszczady, watkins\n\nproportions: square, wide, standard, narrow\n\nframe: none, vignette, bright, dark, bright with vignette, dark with vignette\n\nvisitors: tourists, tourists and birds, solitary flock of birds, only light\n",

            "description": "Square Planets was inspired by a series of OP Art paintings done by Victor Vasarely, called Planetary Folklore Participations No. 2. (c. 1970). Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the third in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nSquare Planets consists of four layers of squares contained within a background square superimposed on top of one another. Each layer is translated from the previous layer but still lies within its boundaries. The background color of each layer is random and its set of squares are another random color. The squares that make up layers two and three are rotated either clockwise or counter-clockwise some random number of degrees within a predetermined range. \n\nThere are many Gestalt interactions within this piece. Layers (square planets) interact with each other in interesting ways. Each new generation with its random color assignments significantly affect your depth perception. Layers appear to come forward or recede. Sometimes there is more \"after-imagism\" between the square sets. Candy for your mind.",

You could get lost for the whole day, building houses on trees, collecting flowers and stones or stealing food from the vegetable garden. Having a brother of the same age made things even better, endless adventures with somebody saving you every time you are too dumb to realize you are walking into troubles.\n\nWe enjoyed the summers with the hot days, the fireflies and the nights full of falling stars. The winters with the snow, the stalactites and our box turtle disappearing for months to then reappear in the spring (Until she did not).\n\nAt the same time, taking care of the garden was a big responsibility, affecting our family life in many ways. Numerous times, I felt like the efforts we were putting in to keep it in order were never enough and nature was always faster in restoring her point of view. A struggle that affects us humans since we started to bend nature at our will, thousands of years ago.\n\nIn my gardens, I tried to capture this struggle, this constant fight to shape nature at our will.\nHowever, I also tried to represent the beauty that can be found in both savage and human shaped nature, if shaped with love and respect.\n\nI dedicate this project to my grandfather, who gave us a garden.\nI am sure he would have loved it.\n\n---\n\nHand coded with love and obsession. 💚\n\nPowered by p5, p5.createLoop and chroma.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\nPress ‘m’ to open a menu with the available outputs.\n\nThe generation of a hi-res image, up to 8000x8000, takes a few seconds.\nThe generation of an Animated GIF takes several minutes and the save command works only once the GIF is complete.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters that can be used to load different configurations.\n\n- mode = 0 | 1\n0 For static PNG images, 1 for animated GIFs\n\n- size = s | m | l\nThe Size of the output, 1080x1080, 4000x4000, 8000x8000 for static images and 512x512, 800x800, 1080x1080 for animated GIFs\n\n- fps = 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30\nFrames per second of animated GIFs\n\n=============> PROFILES <==============\n\t\nWeeds ------------------> 42%\nShapes -----------------> 7%\nFlower Power -----------> 5%\nStrips -----------------> 5%\nBadlands ---------------> 5%\nCircle Flower Packing --> 5%\nIna's Farm -------------> 5%\nFortified Pond ---------> 3%\nFalling Into You -------> 3%\nCultivar ---------------> 2%\nThe Hedge --------------> 2%\nRocky Mountains --------> 2%\nUnreachable Rivers -----> 2%\nMushrooms Heaven -------> 2%\nDante ------------------> 1.75%\nAcid Lands -------------> 1.75%\nProvence ---------------> 1.5%\nThe Springs ------------> 1.25%\nSecret Garden ----------> 1%\nThe Pump ---------------> 1%\nTetris -----------------> 1%\nThe Spiral -------------> 0.5%\nKinetic Sculpture ------> 0.25%\n\nInsects are visible only in the animated outputs.\n\n=============> MAKING OF <=============\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/article/the-making-of-noisy-gardens\n\n---",

            "description": "‘Mapped Orbits for Unbound Electrons’ is a study of circular orbits and noise-based gradients, rendered, shifted, superimposed and cropped in various ways to bring out generative patterns and shapes.\n\nThe main shape is a 'circular gradient' object, the parameters of which include a start and end radius, a number of individual arcs, a width for each arc segment, and an angle shift with some random variation taking place over all these parameters. Random numbers are, as is usual for an fxhash piece, based on a single unique hash value, ensuring the render is the same for each piece. Variations can be rendered, of course, using either the infinite variations button, or by pressing 'p' when the piece is active.\n\nThe generative process takes up to nine of these gradient objects and combines them in six main variants, ranging from a single central piece combining one or more gradients, through to complex pieces where multiple gradients are off-centred and faded across quarters or thirds.\n\nTo further add variation and the opportunity for the stochastic process to bring pleasing results, lines and circles may be overlaid according to various rules. These are curated towards quarters, thirds and sixths, depending on the rendering variation.\n\nFor this piece, palettes are not hard-coded. They are, however, carefully manipulated by selecting an initial hue value and working from this point to produce colours with various limitations. Some renders will be monochrome, or near-monochrome, whilst others will select from the full range of hues available. Others will cluster near to a central point, with one or two circular gradients taking up a contrary position on the colour wheel. There is the chance of a lighter rendering mode, something that may be considered a rare feature.\n\nOther deliberately rare features include background texture, some line overlays, particular configurations of circular gradients. Unintentionally rare features may arise, of course, according to the patterns inherent within random numbers.\n\nCollectors of ‘The Last Days of Fire and Steel’ may have enjoyed the apocalyptic lore behind the piece, and have wondered what caused events, and the nature of the machine alluded to in the piece. The last transmission from the machine may be of interest, and collectors of either piece are invited to discover its location within the piece.\n",

            "description": "'Chimalmat Relics' is a generative art project that pays homage to the great American civilizations (such as the Aztecs, the Mayans and the Incas).\n\nEach piece of the project has 4 stages. \n\nThe first is the expansion, the flourishing, the formation of the cities. In this stage each work begins to grow. The lines evoke the complexity of the cultures and how they progressed, occupying more land, becoming more intricate, complex, beautiful and elaborate. The circles represent the individuals of these cultures, they are large because they represent the greatness of these individuals. The squares represent the temples, so important to these societies.\n\nThe next stage is maturation, it is when lines begin to appear in the background that cover the entire piece and represent the acquired knowledge and wisdom of these cultures, their knowledge of nature, the stars, their art.\n\nThe third stage is decadence, we already know what happened to these civilizations, so this stage enters like a wave from the left that sweeps everything away, erases and blurs the work, the history. It represents the conquest.\n\nThe last stage represents history, memory, what survives today, what we can reconstruct, infer, yearn for those times, there is much that was lost, but the essence remains, it is still there. It allows us and obliges us in a certain way to contemplate and appreciate it.\n\n-----\n\nPress 'e' to export a PNG\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr 2022.\n\nMade with P5js and <3.",

            "description": "\"Garden, Monoliths\" is the result of an algorithm that started in April 2021. It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",
