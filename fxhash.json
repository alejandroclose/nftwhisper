            "description": "With its layered bursts of color, light, and shadow, Supernal Memories carries an underlying message of optimism through its harmony of seeming dualities – hard and soft, familiar and surprising, expression and introspection.\n\nEach newly generated circle brings its own energy, creating layered groups of light that sometimes resemble phenomena like nebula, lightning sprites, and auras – ethereal whispers of something remembered. \n\nSupernal Memories is an invitation to observe the forms & feel of each piece without labeling their qualities, to contemplate the infinite possibilities of the universe, and to explore the depths of your imagination.\n\n\n--\n\nCreated by Diego Pintos @DondiegoTez\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nTo get a high resolution file, add \"&print=14000\" to the end of the live URL / hash, using any resolution number that fits your needs.

            "description": "The code work I am most interested in creating with p5js in 2022 is a type of creation where various elements are developed in a drow() loop based on an initial state.\n\"Flux\" also recursively generates visual images based on the initial state. The result is a form reminiscent of architecture, cityscapes, or neural networks.\n\nThrough the use of the noise() function, the code initially draws lines that are then extended vertically and randomly slide across a certain area.  By repeating this process recurrently, the work itself becomes a visual image, with itself as a constituent element, while being damaged.\n\n\"Flux\" is also a work about autopoiesis (or self-organization) in damage.\n\nThe get()set() is to treat the image generated by the code as an image(), and it may damage the purity of the work as a code. Therefore, I view random get()set() as a metaphor for damage.\n\nThe parameter “interrupt” has a certain probability of being “true”; if it is “true”, the density of the strokes is reduced, but in combination with other parameters, it is not easy to determine whether interrupt is “true” or “false”. Therefore, it is a practically meaningless parameter (attribute), but I added this parameter to imagine an artificiality in the code of nature.\n\nCreating a dimensionless image (one that maintains the same output regardless of screen size) was a challenge due to the inevitable deterioration in resolution and rendering content when the same processing is performed at a smaller size. In order to prioritize resolution, the image was generated at a fixed size and displayed according to the screen size.\n\nIt is possible to get a 3240 x 5760 px png file by right click save.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any inquiries.\n\nArtwork by hasaqui, @hasaqui.\nMade with p5js\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

After that made this generative stuff for fxhash's birthday bash.\n\n#fxhashturnsone\n\nDonations:\n25% to ThreeJs team\n\nThe image contains a binary coded word or phrase with a length of 8 characters. The grays represents 0, the other colors represents 1. One row -> one character. Should be proceed decoding from left to right and from top to bottom.\n\nAn example: 'iloveyou'\n\n01101001\n01101100\n01101111\n01110110\n01100101\n01111001\n01101111\n01110101\n\nThe fxrandom selects a word and the program converts it to binary data. After that, the background (ground and sky) is randomly generated from color schemes. Then the binary gray colors are drawn. Also the color of light next to null colors is randomly generated from color schemes. Random affects also the animation.\n\nThe animation stops when you do these interactions below, then restarts after a few seconds of inactivity.\n\nPress spacebar to change:\n\n- frame view -> without frame\n- without frame -> original 8x8px size\n- original 8x8px size -> frame view\n\nPress 's' to save an svg from current view.\n\nNotes:\n- Build with ReactJs and TweenJs\n- Every upcoming day, half of the remaining pieces are burned.\n\nHappy Birthday fxhash community!\nI'm glad to be among you!",

            "description": "At moment we decide to draw a square on top of a circle, we are defining a time arrow, a third dimension on the 2D plane, where shapes can be on o top of each other, come one after the other. In this project i wanted to remove that time arrow, that third dimension, and leave the 2D plane as flat as possible.\n\nShapes are not drawn in sequence, they are formed by the continuous addition of points to each region defined by the shapes intersections. Not a single region is on top of the other. They are the result of the combination of shapes, and defined by them. Horizontal, decentralized societies. Espacios comunes. We can see the circles, squares, plane cuts, but we cannot give them an order or authority.\n\n-----\n\nKey controls:\n\n- UP arrow: Increases the sketch resolution. It will take longer to render but it will produce better quality images.\n- DOWN arrow: Decreases the sketch resolution.\n- f: Removes or adds an empty frame around the image.\n- d: Increases the points density. More points will be painted and regions will become more full.\n- n: Increases the pixel noise.\n- b: Decreases the pixel noise.\n- z: Switches on and off the simple pixel sorting algorithm. Move the mouse left and right to change the pixel stickiness.\n- x: Switches on and off a more complex version of the pixel sorting algorithm.\n- i: Displays some log information.\n- p: Pauses the sketch.\n- s: Saves a screenshot of the artwork. The image resolution will depend on the sketch resolution, which is controlled by the UP and DOWN arrows.\n\n-----\n\nURL controls:\n\nwidth=2000 will set the sketch width to 2000 pixels.\nproportion=2.3 will set the sketch width-to-height ratio to 2.3.\nYou can combine these two parameters to create any image output you want. For example, to create an image that is 3000 pixels wide and 5000 pixels high, one just needs to add &width=3000&proportion=0.6 to the URL.\n\n-----\n\nSpecial thanks to @andregorayeb (Gora) and @ItonkStudio (Itonk) for letting me use some of their color palettes for this project.\n\n-----\n\nLicense: CC BY 4.0\n\nThis project makes use of the p5.js library.

            "description": "“Klyft” is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at PARIS+ par Art Basel.\n\nKlyft is a juxtaposition of two different projections for the future. One, made by the World Economic Forum, suggests that the global gender gap will have closed by the year 2154. The other, by the UN IPCC, estimates that global warming will reach 3.2 degrees celcius by the year 2100.\n\nKlyft makes use of the unique temporal aspect of computational art by developing its expression gradually over the next 132 years. As we come closer to 2154, the space between the two shapes in Klyft will grow smaller to symbolize the closing of the gender gap. As time goes on, however, Klyft also becomes more and more glitched out to represent the projected increases in greenhouse gases and climate catastrophes.\n\nIn the end, Klyft’s expression will be heavily corrupted, and the two shapes will have reached each other.\n\n· URL parameters ·\n\nYou can add the following parameters to the URL to change the behavior of the piece.\n\ndate=<YYYY-MM-DD> — See how Klyft looks on another day. Use the format YYYY-MM-DD. \n\ncolor=<number> — See the piece in another color scheme. The numbers loop around, so 17 equals 0, 18 equals 1, etc. \n\nresolution=<number> — View the piece in a higher resolution. 1 is normal resolution, 2 is double, etc. No decimals allowed.\n\nimage=true — Save the piece as an image. \n\nrecord=true — Save the piece as a video in WEBM format.\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will show Klyft in double resolution on the day gender equality is achieved according to the WEF:\n\ndate=2154-01-01&resolution=2\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will save a video of Klyft in the ‘Stokkendahl Dalgas’ color scheme:\n\ncolor=14&record=true\n\n· Interactions ·\n\nPressing the following keys will trigger functionality as well as add related URL parameters automatically. \n\nPressing D will increment the date by 1 year.\n\nPressing C will increment the color index by 1.\n\nPressing R will toggle between normal and double resolution.\n\nPressing I will toggle the image URL parameter, which saves the piece as an image. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nPressing V will toggle the video URL parameter, which saves the piece as a video. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nThere are secret key presses as well. Some of them only work outside of iframe. \n\n· Accessibility ·\n\nKlyft is built to support screen readers. It has been tested using MacOS’ VoiceOver, and uses p5.js’ describeElement() to provide screen reader functionality.\n\nIf you have any comments (good or bad) on the screen reader integration, don’t hesitate to reach out on my Twitter: @ada_ada_ada_art. \n\n· Credits and license ·\n\nKlyft is made with p5.js.\n\nKlyft is licensed under a modified version of the Climate Strike License (CSL).",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height. In live mode, click on PNG to save the rendered image.\n\nDepending on the device and CPU usage, it takes from a few seconds (on fast computers) to a minute (sometimes more) on mid-tier phones to render the image. \n\nRequirements: 1GB of RAM. The system needs up to 200 MB of free RAM for rendering square preview images and up to 400 MB of free RAM for rendering square images at the highest resolution. I tested on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge / Windows, Mac OS, Android, and iPhone, but please make sure it works on your device before minting.\n\n-----\n\nPossible features:\n\ncolor scheme: cairngorm, alborz, bardenas, atlas, bieszczady, watkins\n\nproportions: square, wide, standard, narrow\n\nframe: none, vignette, bright, dark, bright with vignette, dark with vignette\n\nvisitors: tourists, tourists and birds, solitary flock of birds, only light\n",

The unnatural drawing order and chromatic differences of the individual faces sometimes yields illusory or paradoxical visual geometries.\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png.

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

            "description": "White Mountain Winter is collaboration between myself and the machine to describe scenes that are real, or were. Yet perhaps now foreign, or out of time, or far away. I provide the seed of a dream I remember, and trust the machine to help make it real again.\n\nI grew up in a town much like some of these, homes dispersed throughout the valley beneath the shadows of the mountains rising around. This is a tribute to the memory of wintertime in that place; bleak, cold, grey, with the light seemingly always fading. Yet at the same time, the feeling of calm, solace, peace resonating through. Exposed to the mountain elements, yet protected by them. A delicate arrangement, but essential.\n\nThe seed of magic I remember is present in the experience of falling snow at dusk. Large flakes tumbling down and blanketing everything, no end in sight. The most striking thing is the silence. The fallen snow absorbing all distraction, insisting that your focus be sharpened to a singularity; right there, right then.\n\n---\n- Best rendered in Chrome browser (best performance, & canvas blur - please be patient :)\n- Made with p5js\n- Press \"s\" to save png",

            "description": "This project is borne out of my longstanding fascination with brushwork, and the intricate textures that can be created with a brush, some paint and a canvas. Brush strokes are simulated using many overlapping lines and given texture and depth using a custom shader. Another important aspect of this work, is the composite forms that are created by the brush strokes, which are my attempt to emulate the emphatic energy of many abstract painters that have come before me. Color palettes are named after common paint colors, based on the background color used for the palette.\n\nThose who collect during the first tier of the Dutch Auction can claim a signed print. They will be printed on A3 Hahnemuhle Photo Rag, and shipped to the collector free of charge. More details on how to claim a print and specify the necessary shipping information will be provided via the artists twitter (@landlinesart1).\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
