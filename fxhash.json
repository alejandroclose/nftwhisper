J. T. Mitchell discusses the concept of \"digital imagery\" and references a mythological figure, Urizen, who appears in the works of William Blake. Mitchell states:\n\n\"Urizen represents measurement and division, drawing the circumference of the world and delineating the boundaries between light and darkness, serving as the sacred rational architect fundamental to the visible universe.\"\n— \" Image Science: Iconology, Visual Culture, and Media Aesthetics \" Chapter 11, by W. J. T. Mitchell.\n\nFrom William Blake's portrayal of Urizen, I sense a central figure in the creation of the world's myriad forms, one immersed in calculating the incalculable, measuring elusive patterns, and tracing the vortex of ever-flowing boundaries.\n\nIn my view, this represents the ongoing collaboration between humanity and computer today.\n\n▒\n\nIn mathematics, θ (theta) typically represents an angle on a plane. Through calculations involving points, lines, and angles (with the assistance of computers), we can create an almost infinite array of shapes. For me, at this level, θ has become a fundamental metaphor underlying the creation of digital imagery.\n\nIn this artwork 'θ', I attempt to connect the metaphorical aspects of mythology with mathematical calculations, imagining myself as a cartographer of creation, striving to capture the fissures in image generation.\n\nHowever, this also signifies that I cannot create anything outright; I am always an individual trying to master the elusive calculations. Only be continually captivated by the corporeal perception and temporal characteristics of digital imagery.\n\n▒\n\n[Key] commands\n\n〘P〙 - pause / continue drawing\n\n〘S〙 - save image // (keep Drawing)\n\n〘1〙〘2〙〘3〙〘4〙 - get higher res image // (Stop Drawing)\n〘2642x3852〙〘3303x4815〙〘3963x5778〙〘4624*6714〙\n\n▒\n\n[Note]\n\n-The display on mobile devices may vary slightly, and it is recommended to open live view on a computer for the best experience.",

            "description": "Summer Daydream is the final chapter in a nature trilogy that I've worked on throughout 2023. The inspiration comes from both the superbloom in California this spring, and the carefree summer vacations of my childhood. I used to live close to a beautiful woodland in northern China, with a willow-lined creek filled with lotus and water lilies. I spent many long summer days playing in the woods with my friends, pretending to be explorers, detectives, martial arts masters, and more ... back then I only dreamed of the future, and now I sometimes dream of the past. Things as small as the taste of a hawthorn berry or the fragrance of a pagoda tree would pull my mind back to that simpler time. I can't remember the shape of the creek or the paths we took, yet the colors are still vivid as new, and they bring me a sense of happiness and peace. \n\nThe artwork is best viewed in full screen mode in a Chrome browser. \n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.09\n\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is based on the width of the browser window.\n[j] Save a JPEG image of the live view, default resolution is based on the width of the browser window.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 1.78 (16/9)]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1.33]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n&res=[output size of the long edge]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac.

Un-tapered exports are intended for plotting on your favorite pen plotter, and include several Inkscape-compatible layer definitions to make plotting different colors possible. (Be sure to disable the background layer.)\n\nThe SVG has no dimensions defined so you will need to set the paper dimensions by adjusting the SVG as needed. I will provide additional detail on how to do this in an upcoming blog post. (The short version is to change the page dimensions in Inkscape and set the viewbox width and height to 1.0.)\n\njpalmer.dev\n@jeffpalmer",

Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

J. T. Mitchell discusses the concept of \"digital imagery\" and references a mythological figure, Urizen, who appears in the works of William Blake. Mitchell states:\n\n\"Urizen represents measurement and division, drawing the circumference of the world and delineating the boundaries between light and darkness, serving as the sacred rational architect fundamental to the visible universe.\"\n— \" Image Science: Iconology, Visual Culture, and Media Aesthetics \" Chapter 11, by W. J. T. Mitchell.\n\nFrom William Blake's portrayal of Urizen, I sense a central figure in the creation of the world's myriad forms, one immersed in calculating the incalculable, measuring elusive patterns, and tracing the vortex of ever-flowing boundaries.\n\nIn my view, this represents the ongoing collaboration between humanity and computer today.\n\n▒\n\nIn mathematics, θ (theta) typically represents an angle on a plane.

J. T. Mitchell discusses the concept of \"digital imagery\" and references a mythological figure, Urizen, who appears in the works of William Blake. Mitchell states:\n\n\"Urizen represents measurement and division, drawing the circumference of the world and delineating the boundaries between light and darkness, serving as the sacred rational architect fundamental to the visible universe.\"\n— \" Image Science: Iconology, Visual Culture, and Media Aesthetics \" Chapter 11, by W. J. T. Mitchell.\n\nFrom William Blake's portrayal of Urizen, I sense a central figure in the creation of the world's myriad forms, one immersed in calculating the incalculable, measuring elusive patterns, and tracing the vortex of ever-flowing boundaries.\n\nIn my view, this represents the ongoing collaboration between humanity and computer today.\n\n▒\n\nIn mathematics, θ (theta) typically represents an angle on a plane.

            "description": "Does entropy across time look the same in a universe different to ours? \n\nThe universe is full of potential energy, recognized as a difference across some scale. Differences in pressure, temperature, state, all act in pursuit of equilibrium. Given enough time, a closed system will eventually fall into an even dispersal. Somewhere in between is some yet-to-be-determined point at which beautiful unexpected forms emerge.\n\nThis system takes the standard model of equal exchange and throws it off balance, so each reaction will randomly decide which side has an advantage over the other, and instead of dispersal, one force will win out.\n\nIn this system, do similar complex patterns appear? Will we see anything new that doesn't appear with our usual rules?\n\nI found this idea very interesting, that even with no law towards chaos, actually the opposite, we can still end in formlessness. A blank end where no pixel differs from another.\n\nI think that through observation of the world and experimenting with its concepts, we can learn far more about life than just the processes we're studying. \n\nI'd be very curious to hear about what you take away from the work, and where your somewhere might be <3\n\nPress the space bar to add another step toward chaos\nPress ‘p’ to add 10 steps (enters mode 2)\nPress ‘f’ to enter an animation that will run for 1,056,993,066,125,486,216,810,417,723,659,732,792 years\nPress 'f' again to pause\nPress ‘a’ to add a new section of order to the system, you can use this when one state has taken over the canvas\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png\nPress ‘1’ or ‘2’ to begin render between the default 3200x4000px or 6400x8000px\n\nCreated by Chris McCully using p5.js, chroma.js, and GLSL.\n\nBuilt to run best on Chrome and Chromium based browsers.",

            "description": "Our lives are like a rich tapestry of interconnected moments, emotions, and decisions that weave and evolve through space and time. These experiences meld together, forming the intricate fabric of our being, shaping our perspectives, and influencing our sense of self, identity, and worldview. Within this elaborate lattice of life, the delicate threads that fill the interstitial spaces illuminate our existence's fluid and ever-changing dynamics.\n\n\"Liminalia\" is an abstract generative art collection that celebrates these liminal moments and spaces that define us, embracing the beauty of imperfection, transformation, and the interrelation of human experiences. The collection employs abstract visual language to portray the delicate balance between randomness and structure, emphasising the significance of our perception of time in shaping these elements and our individual experiences.\n\nThe collection explores life's complexity through the interwoven colours and picture planes that create fluid spaces and in-between zones. With an appreciation for natural surfaces and organic processes, such as erosion, ageing, and patina formation, the collection emphasizes interconnectedness through an organic aesthetic. The carefully designed colour palettes, inspired by various events and phenomena, capture the essence of time and enhance the liminal themes explored throughout the collection.\n\nThrough its harmonious blend of colour, form, and space, \"Liminalia\" explores the subtle junctures where time, nature, and personal development meet and interact. The collection fosters a dialogue between art, science, and the enigmatic mysteries of our existence, underlining the ties between humans and the ever-evolving beauty of the natural world. Consequently, it imparts a sense of optimism, prompting self-reflection and contemplation, and encourages us to appreciate the inherent charm of time's rhythm and the interdependence of all things.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nfx(params)\nLiminalia has recently introduced the fx(params) system, allowing initial minters greater engagement and influence over the final artwork. This innovative system lets you to personalize the final output while exposing the algorithm to greater scrutiny. As a token of appreciation, 20% of the royalties go to the minter.\n\nFor more information on Liminalia's core themes, creative process, and key parameters, see my recently published article at https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/liminalia.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nTechnical\nMade with P5JS and Chroma.js\nOptimized and best viewed in Chrome.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nResolution and Printing\nLiminalia is best experienced in print, providing an immersive and detailed view of the intricate details, rich colour palettes and dynamic interplay of themes.\n\nControls in live mode\n# Press [1] - [5] to change the resolution.\n# Press [s] or [j] to save as PNG or JPEG at the current resolution\nHigh res [5] will output a 10,500px x 16,000px image.\nPlease note that the rendering is processed in 3 main steps, and the filters applied at the end may take a few minutes to render for very high resolution.\n\nTo track the progress of the rendering process, access the development console in your desktop browser.\n------------------------------------------------------------\nLicense\nThis project is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n------------------------------------------------------------\nAcknowledgements\nA big shout-out to everyone who pitched in on this project; your input and effort were invaluable.

            "description": "There is a place in a remote village with only forest and huge meadows and hills around it. I used to spend a few days there in the summer. This year it has become my retreat for the whole summer. There is silence around and no persistent explosions from the bombing. I wanted to use this time to relax and reflect.\n\nWhen I began working on the project, I had no specific goals in my mind. I didn't set myself any tasks, didn't commit to any deadlines. Suddenly, I found something that reminded me of blooming meadows, it was in tune with my state at that moment. So I started to develop this theme. I did not aim to turn it into a realistic picture. The images were supposed to remain abstract, just to convey the general mood and impressions I was feeling.\n \nInitially, it was a story about summer meadows and grasses. But in the process, I had memories of impressions that arose in different seasons, which I observed in nature here. Colour became the main conductor of the story about various states of nature. It is common to see a lot of black soil in spring through which fresh shoots break through, creating bright splashes on a dark background. During the early summer, the area is covered in lush grasses and wildflowers, as well as butterflies. The world blooms and life is reborn. Eventually, the grasses wither due to the hot sun. Sun-burnt straw sheaves take on a special beauty and texture.  As autumn approaches, we turn to the terracotta range, which offers a variety of ripe mature flowers. Winter is all about graphics. During this period, I usually like to take black and white pictures. Every time, every state of nature has its own beauty. As well as every period of our life.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nPlease pay attention: for rendering the project you might need a rather powerful CPU. Depending on your equipment, it may take several seconds to several minutes for the process to complete. \n\nThe project was tested on different browsers; it works best in Chrome.

Differences in pressure, temperature, state, all act in pursuit of equilibrium. Given enough time, a closed system will eventually fall into an even dispersal. Somewhere in between is some yet-to-be-determined point at which beautiful unexpected forms emerge.\n\nThis system takes the standard model of equal exchange and throws it off balance, so each reaction will randomly decide which side has an advantage over the other, and instead of dispersal, one force will win out.\n\nIn this system, do similar complex patterns appear? Will we see anything new that doesn't appear with our usual rules?\n\nI found this idea very interesting, that even with no law towards chaos, actually the opposite, we can still end in formlessness. A blank end where no pixel differs from another.\n\nI think that through observation of the world and experimenting with its concepts, we can learn far more about life than just the processes we're studying. \n\nI'd be very curious to hear about what you take away from the work, and where your somewhere might be <3\n\nPress the space bar to add another step toward chaos\nPress ‘p’ to add 10 steps (enters mode 2)\nPress ‘f’ to enter an animation that will run for 1,056,993,066,125,486,216,810,417,723,659,732,792 years\nPress 'f' again to pause\nPress ‘a’ to add a new section of order to the system, you can use this when one state has taken over the canvas\n\nPress ’s’ to save a png\nPress ‘1’ or ‘2’ to begin render between the default 3200x4000px or 6400x8000px\n\nCreated by Chris McCully using p5.js, chroma.js, and GLSL.\n\nBuilt to run best on Chrome and Chromium based browsers.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s.

Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds.

            "description": "## regenerate : what is it about? ##\n\nI wanted the gradients to portray our inner energy status, like a power charge we keep regenerating. Made of many steps, they create the illusion of continuity. And, just like us, they sometimes disfunction.❤️\n\nThe title illustrates both the energy of these geometric outputs and my own return to a generative art practice. It's also a nod to the \"degen\" culture.\n\n## variations ##\n\nregenerate has 3 types of outputs:\n- the single column, in full color - these are the main outputs and define the visual identity of the drop - pure energy!\n- the single color column on grey - pure contrast!\n- the triplet - dysfunctional in the best sense!\nWell, there might be a 4th type, but that's a surprise...\n\nFor each mint, the number of steps will vary from 60 to 200+. The way the gradients blend into the larger background also depends on the mint: some blend completely, while other tend to the background color but never quite reach it.\n\n## Keyboards controls ##\n\n's' saves a high-res version of your output (4096x4096 px)\n‘m’ saves a low-res version (500 x 500 px), useful for social media\n'p' saves TWO smartphone formatted crops (1176 x 2556 px) so you can take your mint with you all day - one in full saturation, one at half saturation - you can use one for your lockscreen and one for your homescreen, for example, or you can make your own crops from the high-res image.\n\n## Technical note ##\n\nDepending on the size of your window, the number of steps may vary. That is intentional, and made to avoid any moire effects when scaling down. Instead, the overall impression of the output will remain visually the same at any scale.\n\n## Conclusion ## \n\nI hope you enjoy your mint, whether it's a single, triplet, or a powerful color on grey!\nThanks for reading and thanks for minting! 🙏\n\n-raphael, sept. 2023.",
