            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "All outputs contain embedded blueprints for cutting a physical edition with a high powered laser out of 12 layers of archival paperboard. \n\n—————-\n\nIn a realm where the very essence of creation is bound to chaos, there lies a series of masterworks, a testament to the harmonious blend of order and chaos. \n\nEach piece, a confluence of geometric precision and the untamed spirit of the shadow and light, invites the onlooker to traverse the boundaries of the physical and the ethereal.\n\nThe art, attracted to the strong emotions and vibrant events of the world, materializes in a cascade of circular motifs—each a pocket of infinity, reminiscent of echoes, ancient and brimming with latent potential. The lines flow like streams of sunlight, bending and twisting in a dance choreographed by the rhythms of the universe, defying the rigid confines of two-dimensional space.\n\nHere, in these manifestations of creativity, one might sense the influence of imagination, where thoughts and ideas cast a physical form. The colors are whispers of the cognitive realm, vibrant yet bounded by the monochrome discipline of the physical realm, creating a duality that reflects the very nature of all beings—part of two worlds, yet fully belonging to neither.\n\nThe artist, a lightweaver of sorts, has woven a pattern of lies so majestic that they reveal a deeper truth—the truth of beauty inherent in the mathematics of the universe, the geometry of existence, and the profound complexity hidden within the seemingly simple.\n\nThis generative series, thus named “Luminous Echos,” for it is a bridge between the seen and unseen, a crafted illusion that binds the soul of the observer to the eternal dance of creation and cognition—a masterful rendition regarded with a mesmerizing \"Mmmmmmm.\"\n",

This is a collab project developed with my daughter (14) as part of her STEM Fair Project. The “stacked ellipses” function was created and written by her, and will be the sole output for her project. We plan to set up a large monitor at her event and offer phyical prints on site :). She’s an amazing and beautiful human; I can't wait to see her make more art! I hope you enjoy them as much as we’ve enjoyed making this project. This artwork prints both the generative hash and the iteration number on the canvas when it’s minted.\n\n6000x8000 res\n\nPress S to save canvas as jpg.\nPreas P to save canvas as png.\n\nCreated with p5.js and a very patient and creative daughter. ❤",

They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",
