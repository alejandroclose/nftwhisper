            "description": "Hills of Chaos\n\nThe beauty of chaos is the concept that out of disorder, randomness, and unpredictability, can emerge patterns, complexity, and surprising beauty. Chaos theory suggests that small, seemingly insignificant changes in a complex system can lead to dramatic and unpredictable outcomes.\n\nIn art, the beauty of chaos can be seen in many forms, including abstract expressionism, action painting, and generative art. In abstract expressionism and action painting, artists use techniques that rely on chance, spontaneity, and improvisation to create works that are characterized by an energy and vitality that comes from the unpredictability of the process. These works often have a raw and visceral quality that can be very powerful.\n\nGenerative art is another form of art that often celebrates the beauty of chaos. Generative art is created by using algorithms and programming to generate art that is unpredictable and evolving. The artist sets up a system, but the final outcome is determined by the interaction between the system and the viewer. This creates an artwork that is constantly changing and surprising, with the potential for emergent patterns and unexpected beauty.\n\nIn nature, chaos can also be beautiful. Examples include the patterns of clouds, the fractal branching of trees, or the intricate and seemingly chaotic patterns of the ocean waves. These natural systems are often too complex to fully understand, yet they exhibit a beauty that is undeniable.\n\nIn summary, the beauty of chaos lies in its ability to create unexpected and surprising outcomes, whether in art or in nature. The unpredictability and randomness can create patterns and complexity that can be breathtaking and inspiring.\n\nIn 'Hills of Chaos' are two possible sizes, square and rectangular aspect ratios 5000x5000 and 7500x5000, 20 color palettes, some of them taken from \"Studio Yorktown Color Town Hall\" by \n@StudioYorktown (studioyorktown.github.io/coloryorktownhall)\n\nTo download high-resolution 'PNG' file, open 'LIVE' and press 'S'\n\nFebruary 2023\nMade with p5JS library \n\n\n \n",

Also, minters get a share in future royalties of their mints, which may be cool in any reality where they become popular one day.\n\nI'll probably reference these guys on other relevant art I produce, when it seems appropriate.\n\nCoded in p5js.",

To reset to all colors, press 'v'.\n\nYou can save a PNG file using 's', a JPG using 'd', a PNG with twice your window height using 'f', and a print size image using 'g'.\n\nThis work explores composition based on generative double grid system, where rotations, displacements and noisy lines intertwine to form a playful loom.\n\nCreated with p5.js rendering in WEBGL.",

            "description": "Fire Cards is a series of generative artworks inspired by 19th-century Japanese fireworks catalogues. The images in these catalogues didn't so much focus on realism, but on the visual associations of the pyrotechnic effects instead. Using a restricted color palette and relatively simple shapes, this resulted in vibrant, graphical posters that sparked your own imagination more than anything else.\n\nIn Fire Cards, the abstract, static images are transformed back into lively, dynamic worlds again, each with their own distinctive, centuries-old aesthetics. Using a custom animation and 2D render system, the algorithmically generated worlds slowly build up and show a magical fireworks performance.\n\nFire Cards are tiny, personal and unique shows of wonder.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
