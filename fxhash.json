            "description": "Somewhere between pixel-art and axonometric architectural projections, spatial compositions assembled from multi-resolution pixel precise fragments. \n\nHyper Pixel is the result of a continued interest in using projections to represent three dimensional object in  two dimensional picture image, and embracing the fact that all digital images are two dimensional arrays of discrete pixels. In that sense it is also a reaction against both skeuomorphism, or mimicking older media in digital form, and the push towards ever increasing fidelity and resolution. The project uses Military perspective, a form of oblique projection, or 45° - 45° axonometric projection, because these angels can approximated fittingly by square pixel grid. \n\nPress s, m, l, x for exporting an image with increasing resolution.\nPress p for pause.\nPress r for refresh.\n\nMade with P5.js by @introspect0r\n",

            "description": "\"Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a magical kingdom known for its beautiful landscapes and mystical creatures. The kingdom was ruled by a kind and fair queen, who loved nothing more than to spend her days exploring the vast and varied terrain of her realm.\n\nOne day, the queen was wandering through a particularly cold and snowy region of the kingdom when she came upon a strange sight. Instead of snow, the ground was covered with soft, fluffy balls of wool, as if the earth itself had been transformed into a giant ball of yarn.\n\nThe queen was fascinated by this curious phenomenon, and she decided to follow the trail of wool to see where it led. After walking for some time, she came upon a beautiful lake, the surface of which was frozen solid. But instead of ice, the lake was made entirely of woolen fibers, swirling and twirling in the gentle breeze.\n\nThe queen marveled at the sight, and she couldn't help but reach out and touch the soft, velvety surface of the woolen lake. As she did, she felt a warmth and comfort wash over her, as if the wool were alive and pulsing with energy.\n\nOver the years, the queen visited the woolen lake often, always feeling a sense of peace and contentment when she was near it. And as the years went by, the people of the kingdom began to flock to the woolen lake, seeking the same sense of warmth and comfort that the queen had found.\n\nThe woolen lake became a beloved and sacred place in the kingdom, and it was known throughout the land as the \"mar de lã\" - the sea of wool. And so it remained, a magical and mystical place that brought joy and happiness to all who visited.\"\n_AI GPT\n\nMade with <3 and p5.js",
