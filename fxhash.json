            "description": "Each monogrid artwork gets initialized with a start up algorithm that builds up a set of rectangles and fills them with pixels. There are two different styles, 'Pixel' and 'Line', to create the initial image.\n\nThere is a set of 16 animations at work. 4 noise based animations, 4 shifting animations, 4 modulo based animation and 4 reset animations, all run in parallel. Each animation selects a rectangle from the initial setup and edits the pixels in this area. The selection process runs independently and animations can overlap which results in a new style of animation.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 is based on the original series at https://monogrid.xyz, but there are no black/white versions included. The color palette is a mixture of one of 12 colors plus black or white.\nThe fragment shader has been updated in the way the 16 different animations get summed up. This version would appear more chaotic and organic.\n\nmonogrid 1.1 - Collectors Edition\nKim Asendorf, 2022\n\n",

Colors blend skillfully, creating the illusion of light and shadow, yet allowing one to feel the chill of moonlight and the lingering warmth of the setting sun.\n\nThe artist seems to have observed the shaping and destruction of the world with a detached perspective. It is a piece of art that appears to be the result of prolonged contemplation, profound insights, and strength.",

            "description": "This new special edition of Poems in the Public Domain was created for Tezos @ South Beach 2023 and in celebration of fxhash 2.0. \n\nExpanding on the original project, MILK. lets collectors personalize their iterations by including their own annotations at mint time. An acknowledgement of the deeply personal nature of reading, these annotations will also be used to create a separate “communally annotated” version of the piece, to be distributed to holders once the exhibition closes. In composing your annotations, we encourage creativity, implore respect, and recommend minimal use of special characters.\n\nWhen a poem enters the public domain, it no longer belongs to its author but to its readers, who help ensure others will read it. \n\nBy minting a copy of MILK., you are participating in a uniquely modern form of this ageless cycle. Readers, like you, write poetry’s survival. \n\n***\n\nSee the original project here: www.fxhash.xyz/generative/20750\nAnd read about it here: www.fxhash.xyz/article/poems-in-the-public-domain-marginalia-as-living-verse",

Colors blend skillfully, creating the illusion of light and shadow, yet allowing one to feel the chill of moonlight and the lingering warmth of the setting sun.\n\nThe artist seems to have observed the shaping and destruction of the world with a detached perspective. It is a piece of art that appears to be the result of prolonged contemplation, profound insights, and strength.",

Here I take the opportunity to apply this abstract blending technique in a manner that alludes to reality: refracting crystals.\n\nThese generated crystals are not based in fact but imagination. They are illustrative of the magic and wonder some people associate with real life minerals and rocks. They blend together with impossible color changes only possible in the virtual.\n\nEach individual crystal element can be one of these blend modes (with chance):\ndifference (9/16), exclusion (2/16), hard-light (2/16), color-dodge (1/16), overlay (1/16), normal (1/16)\n\nControls:\nPlay/Pause - [Space]\nRotate - [Click + Drag]\nMove - [Shit + Click + Drag]\n\nMinter's Reward: 1/3 Secondary royalties",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

It draws hundreds of thousands of tiny points according to a probability distribution calculated from the positions of the dunes.\n\nThe logic to divide the dunes into light and dark sides is simple, but produces some interesting chaotic behaviour. These are details that weren't hard-coded but emerge organically, such as the patterns on the spines of the dunes or the stripes around their bases.\n\nPlease note that the algorithm can take some time to run, especially when the number of dunes is high.\n\nCreated by lunarean.",

It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",
