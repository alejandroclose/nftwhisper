Some extreme sounds (frequency and amplitude) can be generated.\n\n-Supply can be halved/reduced and/or the price can be doubled if all iterations have not been minted (every 24h aprox).\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n-An audiovisual piece based on randomly generated patterns. These patterns generate endless unique pieces of electronic music (and their corresponding visuals).\n\n-This is a 16-step sequencer based on 2 basic patterns: the kick drum and the tuplets of each kick.\n\n-In each cycle (from 16 to 64 kicks) there can be changes to many of the parameters of the patterns, thus generating changes to the piece in an infinite way.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n-\"tipusGrid\": type of grid-> (lines, rects, soroll (noise), ASCII, mosaic or barcode).\n-\"baseShape\": first cicle base shape (rect, circle,lines, vlines or hlines).\n-\"baseSize\": size of base shape.\n-\"gridDensity\": grid size (16, 32 or 64).\n-\"alpha\": alpha of base image.\n-\"alpha2\": alpha of canvas.\n-\"darkMode\": dark mode (true) or light mode (false).\n-\"color\": color of lines (dark mode) or background (light mode)-> white, red, green or blue.\n-\"bpm\": Beats Per Minute. from 90 to 160 -> this value is theoretical, some devices may not be able to play the piece at a certain speed.\n-\"tipusBass\": type of bass drum (from 0 to 5).\n-\"maxTuplet\": max number of tuplets for each kick.\n-\"reverb\": has reverb effect (audio)",
