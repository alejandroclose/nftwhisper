            "description": "The explanation for returning home can vary depending on the specific piece, but here is a general explanation:\nHere I want to capture the essence of nostalgia, unity and excitement that surrounds the \"Homecoming\" celebration. I have shown this exciting show with squares and circles in a frame, the return of geometric shapes to the empty frame that is their home. It may have vibrant colors and dynamic combinations to evoke a sense of energy and excitement, or it may have cold and calming colors that can include both feelings of happiness and sadness. \n\"Homecoming\" style vary from traditional to contemporary depending on the viewer's point of view and the target audience. It may incorporate elements of realism, impressionism, abstract expressionism, or any other art style that effectively conveys the spirit of \"Homecoming\". It may depict scenes of returning home in the viewer's mind or remind a memory. Some pieces may focus on feelings and memories associated with returning to a particular place or reconnecting with the past or present.\nThe purpose of this work is to celebrate the sense of belonging and pride that comes from returning back to the roots. It serves as a visual representation of cherished memories and shared experiences while evoking anticipation for future encounters.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "--mirror-- is inspired by New York City's evolving skyline and its artistic representations. A couple of years ago, I was particularly struck by Elmgreen & Dragset's \"The Hive,\" an installation of upside-down skyscrapers in the hall of NYC's Penn Station. I've tried to produce images that stand somewhere between figurative representation and abstraction, distorting the shapes of inverted buildings into dream-like apparitions.\n\n/* Saving an output /*\n\nJust press ’s’ on the keyboard to save a 4096 x 4096 image of your minted output. Feel free to contact me if you want an even larger image.\n\n/* Features and variations */\n\n\"Grouping\" indicates the proximity of the shapes to one another: TIGHT means they're close, while APART signifies more distance between them.\n\n\"Filling\" refers to the degree of fullness of the drawing - WIRE draws only the outline of each square, WINDOW fills the square but leaves some blank space around it, and FULL mixes both.\n\n\"Orientation\" is predominantly MIRROR, with shapes anchored at the top. However, occasionally it's NATURAL, with anchor points at the frame's bottom.\n\n\"Background\" simply denotes the background color.The prevalent one is the dark CATSKILL NIGHT, followed by the lighter UES GREY. A few other colors make sporadic appearances.\n\n/* Colors /*\n\nRather than using fixed color palettes in this project, I generate most colors randomly, bending or constraining the choices with a few rules. This process allows for unexpected color combinations to appear. Making generative rules for colors rather than predetermined palettes makes more sense to me and allows for a wider (and wilder) variety of outputs.\n\n/* Technical info /*\n\nThis project was developed in p5js, the javascript port of Processing.\nColor blending is achieved with the help of the mixbox library. That helps in rendering more vivid and saturated colors in the gradients that compose the skycrappers.\n\nWhen you save an output, the number in the filename is the seed used to generate your particular mint.\n\n/* Conclusion /*\n\nThanks again for minting and reading!\nI hope you had fun discovering your mirror output.\nKeep dreaming.\n\n-raphael, Nov. 2023",

Things I want to use; sprites, text-font, filters, lines, 3D etc. \nLike kinda lego blocks. Some routines I re-use for 30 years now. \nAlthough often they have changed over time.\n\n\nVanilla javascript - And directly control your rgb buffer\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\ncons:\n- can be overwhelming for starting coders compared to p5js\n- you have to write / use and tinker with new drawing routines by yourself. \n- still can be optimized a lot, and run much faster\n-- (feel free to do that! - release new versions yourself)\n- I just coded it in Notepad++ and tested it in a browser.\n- I have no experience with git-hub, or those other nifty tools\n- I'm more an Artist than a coder, still learning new things as well.\n- I have my own 'old' coding style I picked up ages ago, and still use now and then. Started with basic and Z80a as a teenager.\n- for sure there are still some stupid bugs, spelling errors in it  ^___^\n\npros:\n- fxtemplate - fxpreview when done drawing / splash-screen support on top; while drawing.\n- do like 4000 x 4000 images on safari; on an old Iphone 5\n- just 1 index.html now - small file size: \n- the source of the 'cleaned-up' version is now 34b (not minified, and still comments in the source; can be even smaller)\n- direct control of the RGB buffer; every pixel.\n- I added some basic routines, like drawing points, lines, squares, sprite-brushes, filters, and my pixel-font\n- draw, add-mix or subtract - manipulate every pixel how you wish\n- I work with a big off-screen kind of image; a rgb-buffer; so drawing goes 'mucho' faster and render it to a screen-scaled image.\n- no other libraries used\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nMouse-click switches between:\n- screen scaled image\n- The large image \n\n- The work will refresh and restart after some time\n\nSave image - with s-key \n(includes the fxhash key-seed and num# of the follow-up images)\n--- It can take some seconds before the saving happens; \n--- the browser has to handle (very) large MB .png files first \n--- before it can save them \n\n- splash image support - to hide drawing at start\n- redraw the image after a while; or not.\n- mouse position check for the bigger image\n- fps counter for testing etc.\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nwritten in vanilla JavaScript, more info in the source-code\n\n\ndrawz - latest or an updated version can be found at.\nhttps://elout.home.xs4all.nl/drawz/\n\nIt would be nice; to include more routines into it\nin the future.\n\nAnd instead of 1 big library with everything in it\nI would like to have these templates; \nwhere you can add different little snippets and routines \nthat you want to use into it, and start playing next.\nStill learning new things as well. And getting inspired.\n\nI don't mind people to use the tech-source as a start for their own projects. \n\nBut the palette, and composition & structure build-up; is mine. \nDon't change just 1 or 2 -things then re-release it.\n\nIf you want to release something of your own,\nyour sketch and generative work; really should look total different!\nYou can use the technics to draw new things,\nbut you have to start from scratch again; \nchoosing points, lines etc. to play with and go from there.\nEnjoy! \n\n\n-for the love of Art and jumping in rain puddles-\n\n'like jimi and guitar'  0__.  ^____^\n\n\nxxx  amsterdam  chillout\n\nSeptember 29, 2022\n",
