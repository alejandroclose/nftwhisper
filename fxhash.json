            "description": "menToll was inspired by a series of OP Art paintings done by Victor Vasarely, called Toll (from the Permutations Series). (c. 1965) Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the fifth in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nmenToll is two layered piece. A 2x2 array of arrays of circles contained within a background square. A similar sized array of squares (with no background of its own) is superimposed and centered on top. Each array of circles with a square has an opacity gradient applied to it allowing its uniquely colored random background to show through its elements. The superimposed top layer of squares is a solid random color.\n\nThere are many Gestalt interactions within this piece. Circle groups within each of their containers interact with each other, and their background, in interesting ways. Each new generation with its random color assignments significantly affects your depth perception. The top layer appears to come forward or recede depending on the layer it overlaps. And depending on color combinations there is a variety of \"after-imagism\" interactions between the squares in the top set. More candy for your mind.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",
