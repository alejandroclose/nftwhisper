            "description": "This project is a playful attempt to depict how Neo-plasticism painters abstracted compositions, inspired and a tribute to the \"De Stijl\" movement, drawn using statically rendered block elements. The visual language reminds the original designs of famous artists of this art movement; in this project, each color palette is categorized by the name of a favorite piece of these artists. These palettes are sometimes determined by the color combination of this artist's works, which form the visual identity of their works from the color dimension.\nIn this project, different nodes are simple orthogonal shapes of color spots and thin lines to demarcate colors. I tried to create a dynamic effect by questioning the usual signs of vision in the abstract works of this period, to modify the relationship between them profoundly, and to show another field of my understanding of this movement by drawing a personal space.\nThe colors red, black, blue, and yellow were used from this turning point in the Neo-plasticism that the artists of the 'De Stijl movement cared about.\nSubtle black lines separate the vast rectangles, which for some are filled with bright or black, or gray; each small component is a member to create a whole and a single visualization, and each aspect of the components receives its visual value from the whole.\nThis work has set 27 color palettes and three variations to shape different rarities. It is better to set the browser to standard mode to see the effect better.\n\nDe Stijl\n \nThe style \"De Stijl\" of the Dutch avant-garde movement is an essential key to understanding the sources of the modern movement. The movement is organized around three central figures: the painter Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg and the furniture designer and architect Gerrit Rietveld. Other core members are the painters Bart van der Leck, Georges Vantongerlo, and Willmus Huzar; the architects J.J.P Oud, Robert van Hoff, and Jan Wills; the poet Anthony Cook, later the graphic designer Piet Zwart and the architect Cornelis van Stern.\nIn 1918, a year after the official founding of the group and publication of the magazine's first issue that published and publicized the movement's doctrine, the creators of De Stijl combined the aesthetic and social vision. The group's first manifesto calls for a new balance between the individual and the universal and fights to free art from the limitations of the cult of individualism. \n \nDe Stijl originates both in the Hegelian tradition and in the Theosophical movement, then spreading in the Netherlands, both a utopian vision and a commitment to the production of the reality of the industrial world. However, it is a formal, plastic, pictorial, or architectural transcription of the principles of universal harmony that its creators implement. Painting, sculpture, furniture design, graphic design, architecture, and soon urban planning support this experiment, carried out simultaneously by different group creators. De Style productions naturally go beyond the traditional and academic division between primary and secondary arts, decorative arts, architecture, and urban planning.\nFrom the realm of the mind to the city, this can be the guiding thread for the evolution of the Style's productions during its fourteen years of life. The spatial nature of the work of art gradually reaches from the status of supporting the analysis of the world to a factor in building the social and political environment of the city. In this way, the spatialization of the work forms an experience of the world, gives order to the world, and gives essence to society. \nThe Style's priority is to invent an official language that responds to the challenges of the industrial society after World War I and outlines strategies for implementing the new social order.\nThe method of this vision is Neo-plasticism, which initially consists in radicalizing the approach of the contemporary avant-gardes.",

Franke, a pioneer of computer art, passed away on July 16, 2022 at the age of 95. CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE is an homage to Franke’s MONDRIAN software developed for the Texas Instruments TI 99/4 home computer in 1979, and it’s a fundraiser to digitize his archive:\n\n“Our goal is to raise 20,000 Euro so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. If we raise more money, it will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.” \n\nEach frame, a single “pixel” is added to the CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE image. When the software first loads, 100,000 frames are run in the background to start things off. Keep it running for hours or days to see it transform entirely — it’s an “infinite animation.”",

Differing opacity, blend modes, and pixel skipping were used to create some interesting textures.\n\nIn my testing, many of the renders, especially the more earth-tone ones, reminded me of art used in fast food restaurants in the 90s when I was growing up.\n\nFeatures:\nFour different sizes: 9x16, 11x14\", 12x18\", 12x12\"\nPortrait or landscape orientation\n~500 color pallets, one black and white, one CMYK, one RGB, and the rest from Jam3/nice-color-palettes.\n\nDependencies:\nprocessing/p5.js\nlodash/lodash\nJam3/nice-color-palettes\n\nExport to a PNG format at several different sizes.\n- Press s: save the current render size\n- Press t: scale to screen size\n- Press f: full print size (see features for dimensions)\n\nLicense: CC-BY\n\nPlease find me on Twitter and Instagram at @natenolting.\n",

The human settlements are growing like huge organisms – and the growth is often impossible to plan, control or limit.\nCities as a phenomenon are with their incredible complexity highly enigmatic structures, that are as fascinating as they are terrifying.\n\nThis project is a study of the beauty of complexity.\n\nEach city iteration is an entirely unique structure with unique hatching, arrangement of buildings, heights, sizes, additions and rare items.\nThe cities are made even more organic by the meticulous modelling of analog ink drawing.\n\nThe project is 100% generative. All lines, hatching and dots are generated for each iteration.\n\nAs a gesture of appreciation towards our supporters, 20% of royalties will go to the original minter.\n\nKey commands:\nPress 's' to save a png version\nPress '2' to render at twice the resolution\nPress 'b' to remove the colored background before saving\n\nThe loading progress is animated, hence the epileptic trigger warning.\nDue to memory constraints on mobile devices, rendering uses a lower resolution on these.\n-----------\n\nOriginal concept by @Lax_raven\nAll code by @r1b2art",

What thoughts and feelings swirl around in the dark at 3am? \n\nThis generative work explores the connectedness of our thoughts at night, how things can slip in and out of consciousness into the realm of sleep.\n\nEach piece is a map of worries, a chart for a sleepless night. Some nights are sparse and peaceful, others full of competing ruminations.  \n\nEach variation has been generatively created by code:\n- Hand-plotted rumination shapes that are generatively altered for each variation. \n- Each shape is unique in form and movement. \n- Generative properties determine the complexity or otherwise of the map, along with form and colour. \n- Subtle movement gives life and a sense of nocturnal unease.\n\n\nMade with code and love by AutoEclectus.\n\n AutoEclectus is a visual artist specialising in algorithmic-based generative works. \n\n@autoeclectus everywhere: \n- Links and gallery: https://autoeclectus.art\n- Twitter: autoeclectus\n- Instagram: autoeclectus",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.

Collectors should still look closely and choose what they like when buying on secondary.\n\nWhich team are you on? X or O?\n\nfollow culla on twitter for updates. Or maybe __acolyte__\n\nIf the non reserved tokens mint out quickly, Access List mints will have 24 hours to mint reserves assigned to those wallets\n\nThank you for supporting an emerging artist in the generative art space\n\nAccess List reserves were given to holders of the following PFP collections created by culla\n2x for each Basqunk held\n1x for each Inkspunk, TwoFourQunk, V0iD, DeeManz, Punkasso and CR0$$KULL\nYou would have needed to transfer the above tokens to your mint wallet at the time of the snapshot\n\nshare your tokens on social media with #genxyznft\nMade with love by culla using p5.js",

Today, our most basic human rights are being ignored in Iran, and we fight for them every day. In my land, women fight and die but do not accept humiliation. Women and men stand shoulder to shoulder and fight together.\n\n🟢I published this collection of 1401 generative tokens to show my support for the people of Iran. 401 tokens are reserved for other known supporters of this cause, and 1000 tokens are free to mint.\n\n🟢All my works about Iran's freedom are royalty-free and will always be.
