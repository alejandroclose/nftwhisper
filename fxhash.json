            "description": "Kelp represents the third \"published\" output of our renewed collaboration. We were inspired by an underwater photograph taken looking through a kelp field and upward toward the sun. An old art professor of mine told me that art comes from nature so this is a concerted effort to bring some of that into our imagery.\n\nThis is a layered image. The background layer has a 50% probability of being a radial gradient representing the sun. Of the remaining 50%, the background can be a solid random color 25%, or 25% of the time no color or white. \n\nForward from the background, based on some more random probability, from one to possibly four layers of kelp lines can be drawn. The kelp lines are a variation Chris' vector field/ linear interpolation algorithm where the lines never cross but with a refinement. The thickness of a \"kelp\" line is not constant, it varies in width sinusoidally. The amount of thickness is relative to the z-depth of the layer. \n\nIt was very tempting to sway the kelp in the ocean current but we'll save this idea for another time.\n\nWe give you the option to decide. The images produced by the algorithms in this composition have the voluptuous, organic quality of an underwater landscape with or without the sun in the background. We hope you enjoy our attempt at nature in this collaboration.\n\nOur story: In 1973 I was an instructor of Engineering Graphics in the College of Engineering at Michigan State University as well as a graduate student in Graphic Design. In the College of Engineering I was fortunate enough to meet Christopher Scussel, a fellow graduate student who was majoring in a new program called Computer Science. I was struggling using the earliest forms of computer equipment and the cumbersome programming language called FORTRAN to make make computer art. I asked Chris for help and he graciously consented. That began our amazing friendship that has lasted to this day.\n\nChris and I collaborated on a number of early pieces. He showed me how to formulate algorithms into code. He showed me how to program the primitive equipment of the time: line printers, storage scopes and pen plotters to make graphic output. We even built our own graphic output device, an 8 x 8 array of light bulbs. We were indeed pioneers.\nChris graduated in 1976 and has since retired after working 37 years as a research scientist at Bell Labs. I went on to get a Ph.D in 1981 and moved on with my life (see my story on (www.drbillkolomyjec.com). I started making generative art again in 2020. In true \"glory days\" spirit I tracked Chris down to see if he was interested in collaborating. Once again he graciously consented citing an opportunity for \"creative stimulation\", so here we go again. It is pure joy to be working with Chris again. \n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Square Planets was inspired by a series of OP Art paintings done by Victor Vasarely, called Planetary Folklore Participations No. 2. (c. 1970). Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the third in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nSquare Planets consists of four layers of squares contained within a background square superimposed on top of one another. Each layer is translated from the previous layer but still lies within its boundaries. The background color of each layer is random and its set of squares are another random color. The squares that make up layers two and three are rotated either clockwise or counter-clockwise some random number of degrees within a predetermined range. \n\nThere are many Gestalt interactions within this piece. Layers (square planets) interact with each other in interesting ways. Each new generation with its random color assignments significantly affect your depth perception. Layers appear to come forward or recede. Sometimes there is more \"after-imagism\" between the square sets. Candy for your mind.",

It was a grueling process that's why I remember it; quite the way to develop an appreciation for the letterforms and type faces. \n\nThis algorithmic artwork is modern cuneiform. It is based on a theory I've developed called \"Language of Vision\" which in itself is an approach for creating a \"plastic\" image. The space-frame or background square consists of a subtle paper texture and defines the tablet. A resizable tile (spatial force) forms the boundary for a \"stroke.\" The stroke within the tile element is created by joining two bezier curves. \n\nAn algorithm called \"fractions of the whole\" is a \"form of spatial organization\" which divides the picture frame into randomly sized intervals along each axes that form the variable sized tile areas. The stroke is programmed to fit each area. This theory lends itself very nicely to algorithmic art and provides a general framework for generative art.\n\nThere is meaning in every image but that meaning comes from your experience and imagination.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "MINI-EXPLOR, Example 3, Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids\n\nThis is the first in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nChristopher Scussel and I have collaborated to recreate a faithful translation of MINI-EXPLOR from its original FORTRAN and the limited graphics capabilities of output equipment of the day (c. 1975) to JavaScript that takes advantage of today’s personal computers and their graphical capabilities. This has been a labor of love. Chris worked at Bell Labs for 37 years. I knew Ken as an artist and contributor to a computer art exhibit I curated in 1980. Our intention is to “modernize” the code and use in today’s genre of Generative Art.\n\nIn Knowlton’s paper he gave a programmer’s description of MINI-EXPLOR as well as several example to test the described functions and routines. Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids was one of those examples. \n\nMINI-EXPLOR generated images for output on line printers and early CRT displays. It had a limited palette of 4 “characters” that consisted of configurations of alphanumeric characters, some over-struck, to produce a grayscale. In our representation we have replaced these alphanumeric character configurations with the concept of a “cell” consisting of 5x5 pixel blocks. For now, our picture space is in keeping with the original 140 character limit thus, the image size is 5 x 140 or 700 pixels in height and width.\n\nWe present to you the reincarnation of MINI-EXPLOR. We’ve kept the output as faithful as we could to Ken’s original test example. We’ve done three things to modernize the output for this NFT: 1) reformatted the output of the test example to use the full picture space. 2) replaced the original alphanumeric characters that made up a gray scale with blocks of 5x5 pixel “cells” and, 3) we’ve added color. Color EXPLOR images back in 1975 were produced using post-production techniques (printing inks or color gels). However, today full-color capabilities are an inherent part of the media and we use several algorithms to build gray-scale and RGB palettes limited to 4 colors as it was a restriction of the medium in the original design.\n\nWe honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history.",

            "description": "Organic Illusion is one of the very first computer graphic drawings I produced that I considered worthy of being called Art. This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory. Like a child you never forget. I submit to you again in new media for you all to enjoy.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Creature Transformations is the application of the algorithm of a previous work published here on fxhash called TransformationStudy23. For this generative artwork, I reconstructed the same database from sketches I saved for almost 50 years. A database of the digitized coordinates for four outlined figures (a frog, a cat, an elephant, and a frog) which I used in several plotter art works. These representational figures were contrived; in the sense that they all were all designed to be drawn as a continuous line, digitized in the same direction, and they had the same number of points. This made it relatively simple for me to manipulate them as I learned to program and formulate simple algorithms.\n\nPlease refer to the description for TransformationStudy23 for more background.\n\nBy superimposing two creatures, one over the other, an interesting visual transformation can be made. Line segments of one image are randomly removed based on a percentage which it is drawn over another image whose line segments are added randomly with the inverse percentage. Over a series of frames, it appears that one image changes into the other. To make things a bit more visually interesting I randomly rotate the images in each frame.\n\nFigure one (upper left corner) is a randomly selected creature that I transform to a second creature (lower right corner) over 81 frames. (The sequence represented here as 9 stacked rows of 9).\n\nI choose to not add color and keep the image as true to being drawn on a plotter as was the case back in the 1970's. Black pen on a white background.\n\nI hope you enjoy my retrospective recreation of both the algorithm and its application to the creature menagerie.\n\nPlease visit: www.drbillkolomyjec.com",
