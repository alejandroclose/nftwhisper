            "description": ">>> GAN ⫷glitch⫸ Ting Xu |  幹亭序 <<<\n\n• Generative glitch collage: More than simply a + b + c •\n\n\nAt the apex of Chinese calligraphy, Lantingji Xu, the preface, was written by the most renowned calligrapher in China, Wang Xizhi (王羲之).\n\nDuring the Spring Purification Ceremony, forty-two literati gathered along the banks of a coursing stream and engaged in a \"winding stream\" drinking contest: cups of wine were floated on the water upstream, and whenever a cup stopped in front of a guest, they had to compose a poem or otherwise drink the wine. At the end of the day, twenty-six literati composed thirty-seven poems in total and the Lantingji Xu, as a preface to the collection, was produced by Wang on the spot.\n\nIn the GTX collection, we create new intricate and expressive relationships between ink, paper, and pixels using Jimi's raw calligraphy work, their GAN offsprings, and Thomas's CHX-like glitch processing, generating unique calligraphy on mint and toasting at the same time.\n\n\nHow it works:\n\nCombining sets of raw layers that range from paintings, calligraphy, and GAN seeds, our algorithm applies an array of image processing magic, creating intricate novel outputs.\n\nWe have 102 raw layers separated into four groups. Each final output is formed by mixing and processing four randomly selected layers. \n\nGroup 1 contains textures, and it is composed of Jimi's paintings, GAN seeds from mixed custom models, and CLIP Guided Diffusions. \n\nGroup 2 contains Jimi's calligraphy work. \n\nGroup 3 contains GAN calligraphy seeds from custom models we trained on Jimi's body of work. \n\nGroup 4 contains digital grain textures.\nOur algorithm starts by selecting one layer from each group, assigning them sizes, opacities, orientations, and other parameters. Then it sets a dithering combination to be applied. We have eight combos formed by combining seven different custom dithering algorithms (3 at a time). \n\nAfter each dither gets applied to its corresponding layer, images get mixed using different blend modes to help combine them in fun ways. Afterwards, a couple more filters get applied to glue everything together. When all is said and done, final artworks get rendered onto the canvas.\n\nSit back, open the live view, and enjoy. \n\n\nAppreciate the art, not the speculation. Pay what you can. \n\nWith love, sweat, and tears –drops– \nJimi and Thomas.\n\n\nJimi's notes:\n\nI provided the calligraphy representing the extreme spectrum of my expression in brushwork and poetry. I also evaluated the GAN calligraphy outputs, helping Thomas hone the models. During the training process I was horrified and in awe by both the stupidity and sometimes brilliance of the GANs.\n\nThrough the layering techniques developed by Thomas, I have also gained new insights into calligraphy, taking it beyond brush, ink and paper. The spectrum of expression in calligraphy gets freed from traditional constraints in GTX. Fx(hash) calligraphy has become brush, code and screen. \n\nThomas does not read Chinese, but I was happy to let him crop my scrolls into square layers in ways he saw fit with the project's aesthetic. To my surprise, I did not only agree with his visual choices but also noticed how the illiterate crops had many Freudian slips. That is, my poetry made sense fractally. I think this is no coincidence for calligraphers that write their poetry. Calligraphy is more than the sum of beautiful brushstrokes and also greater than the sum of pretty characters. Calligraphy is the composition of space and semantics. Only in turn does meaning takes its place in parts of calligraphy. \n\n\nControls:\n[s] save as PNG.\n\n\nPaint / Ink / Photography –> GANs / Diffusions –> p5.js –> Blockchain\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2022 Thomas Noya and Jimi Wen\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n◉_◉ ◉_◉",

            "description": "\"◉◉◉\" presents a collection of pointillistic drawings generated by p5js. However, the work deviates from the traditional method as employed by Georges Seurat; rather than placing the smallest units of dots, the process involves scaling down the dots from larger to smaller sizes. As a result, finer details are progressively drawn, creating a visual blend of colors as the dots overlap.\n\"◉◉◉\" project is an exploration of pixels and dots in the computer, but also of painting itself.\n\nThe technique is an application of a simple random walk algorithm. Walkers, each designated with a color, traverse the canvas. The overlapping and colliding footprints of these walkers instigate a color-on-color confrontation, eventually creating distinguishable ground and figures. This process elicits the illusion of a visual object, exposing the viewer's cognitive processes and continuously reenacting the site of image formation.\nIn fact, I have painted such an abstract on a physical canvas before, and the way the p5js develops the sensation of brushstrokes and color combinations does not seem very different from the sensation of the paintbrush and canvas at that time.\n\nMuch like Damien Hirst's Spot Paintings, the multi-layered dots eventually settle at regular intervals after a specific number of iterations. The smallest dots, resembling the texture of a canvas, along with the added motion of the dots, akin to dripping paint, bestow the work with a more painterly flavor.\nThis piece serves as both a token of gratitude for my existing collectors and a technical demonstration of my craft.\n\n2400 × 2400 px\np5js\n2023 July\nhasaqui\n",

            "description": "Acequia (“ah-seh-kee-uh”) - a Spanish adaptation of the Arabic word as-sāqiya, meaning “water carrier”. \n\nIn our second collaboration, Rich and Rick are back with our blend of generative code, intricate design, attention to detail, and a splash of charm. \n\n Acequias are traditional irrigation canals used to distribute rainwater and snowmelt along a complex network of narrow channels. They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

That is the default Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ when switching \n  orientations\n\n  For animation:\n- Spacebar: toggle animation (on/off)\n- R: Reset the center of animation (if has been modified with click or drag)\n\nMOUSE:\n\n- Click (or Click & Drag) to set the center of animation\n\n----\nMade with p5js and custom shaders\n\n© Dec. 2022  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

            "description": "This project began as an exploration of how human beings across all sorts of cultures respond in remarkably similar ways in terms of associating sounds with shapes.  That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",

            "description": "\"初夏の旅路 Traveling in Early Summer\"\nis part of the interactive minting experience at Proof of X with KUMALEON, Tokyo, 2023.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nConcept:\n\nAs the rainy days came to an end, the gentle fall of cherry blossoms marked the arrival of early summer. This transitional phase between spring and summer brings a mild and pleasant climate. Nature awakens, showcasing vibrant shades of green as plants thrive and flourish. A stroll through the streets of Tokyo reveals a captivating sight: hydrangeas of various colors grace every corner, casting a spell of natural beauty. While the occasional typhoon may pass by, it does not overshadow the charm of this season. Moreover, the ripening plums offer a taste of traditional Japanese flavors, with options ranging from sour plums to plum wine.\n\nMy inspiration for this piece draws upon my own impressions of early summer in Japan. In 2019, having recently arrived in Japan, I embarked on a journey to Kamakura with my friends. The vivid hydrangeas and serene ponds at Hasedera Temple left an indelible mark on my memory as my first encounter with the essence of early summer in Japan. It was during that year that I delved into the realm of creative coding, by using Processing. The following year, in 2020, I ventured further into generative art using P5.js. Both my pursuit of knowledge in Japan and my creative endeavors became integral parts of my life's journey, akin to cherished scenic spots that leave a lasting impression. Through my artwork, I aspire to share my sentiments from this transformative voyage with the audience.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nNow, let's delve into the details of my creation. The objective of this artwork was to portray a top-down perspective of a pond encircled by lush vegetation, reminiscent of a landscape painting. To imbue the work with different atmospheres, I incorporated four distinct styles for the plant elements: grass, leaves, pine needles, and bubbles. The interplay of these elements breathes life into the still scene, infusing the entire artwork with vitality. The rippling water and gracefully swimming koi in the pond evoke a sense of movement, juxtaposing the serene setting. In Eastern culture, koi symbolizes wealth, auspiciousness, health, and happiness. It bestows good fortune upon those who encounter it. Ultimately, my artwork encapsulates my initial impression of early summer in Japan through a creative approach that intertwines reality and imagination, merging motion and stillness.\n\nThrough this artistic endeavor, I aim to transport the audience to the captivating realm of early summer in Japan. With its vibrant colors, gentle breezes, and the promise of new beginnings, this season captures the essence of natural beauty and the richness of Japanese culture. May my work resonate with viewers, allowing them to embark on their own journey through the enchanting landscapes of their imagination.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nSave as a Picture:\n\nPress “s”or “S” to download a PNG copy of the artwork.\n",
