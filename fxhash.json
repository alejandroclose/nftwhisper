Most strokes are blurred, some are repeating.\n\nAll editions share the same base color palette. From it three different palettes are derived for the light, medium and dark colors. Press 'c' to get a better idea of how this works.\n\nInitial sketch made for the Weekly Creative Coding Challenge hosted by Raphaël de Courville (@Sableraph).\n\nCommands:\nf = fullscreen toggle\nb = change window background color\nc = color palettes overlay toggle\ns = save image at 1080 x 1920 pixels\np = save image at 3240 x 5760 pixels",

Ant colonies, mushrooms, and trees all follow basic principles, yet their resulting actions and growth patterns are fascinatingly intricate. For example, ants can exhibit intelligent collective behavior, fungi are highly successful organisms that make up a larger biomass than all animals combined, and each tree is unique.\n\nThese emergent properties arise from the environment in which these simple rules operate. A tree's growth is influenced by many factors such as soil, water, seasons, wind, humidity, light, and interactions with other plants and animals.\n\nThis series is a reflection on the beauty and uniqueness of each living thing, and how complexity emerges from simplicity.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, we’ve used a custom variant of the \"reaction-diffusion\" algorithm, which approximates some biological systems. This algorithm was introduced by Alan Turing in 1952 in his paper titled \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis.\" The rules are very simple but by changing the initial conditions and adding perturbations, we can reach very different visual outcomes.\n\nIn this way we create a dialog between the strict mathematical rules interpreted by the machine and the organic visuals that emerge from it.\n\n--------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2560px resolution\nPress 'P' to save the image at 3840px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\n\n--------\n\nWilliam Watkins\nApril 2023",

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however.

This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation.

This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1.

            "description": "After years of exploring the possibilities of algorithmic art, I have come to believe that I should enjoy the process and be guided by the exploratory nature of creative coding. This whole project began with a happy accident - my innocent desire to recreate by code a piece of art whose layers my friend Flexasaurus had forgotten to save.\n\nWe both have been pursuing the creation of simple shapes and compositions that could evoke a range of thoughts, associations and emotions in the viewer. Our inspiration is rooted in non-objective art, Suprematism, and Brutalism architecture, focusing on the use of basic geometric shapes, bold colors, and digital textures to create visual interest and depth.\n\nWe certainly know that geometric, non-objective art is probably the most overused concept in creative coding, and yet our \"non-objective Cliché\" was too entertaining and too provocative. I was intrigued, and Flexa loved to curate and inspire me along the way, so I could not work on anything else until it felt finished.\n\nWhile working on this long form project, I grew to want each output unique enough that it could not be confused with any of the other iterations. This led me to explore a variety of compositions and algorithmic ways to create them. In the process, I discovered even more of the unique possibilities offered by the algorithms, and the result came out beautiful.\n\nSomething was missing, however. Kazimir Malevich's \"Black Square\" or any of Rothko's color field compositions would not evoke the same feelings without their unique physical texture. I could try to recreate a physical texture, but that was not my way.\nI wanted to find a purely digital, code native way to achieve texture that moves you.\n\nI started with something as simple as a dashed line.\n\n- - - -\n\nthen a dashed rectangle\n\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n- - - -\n\nand a dashed disk, and a triangle. Such a purely digital concept is in the nature of the code - the sequence of ZERO's and ONE's.\n0101010101 - It is a ONE or a ZERO. A signal or its absence. Something or nothing. I loved it! I guess it loved me too, because the coding gods allowed me to dig and dig and dig and dig, adding different shaped 'strokes', different intervals, random endings, circular strokes, Perlin noise matched fields of strokes, noise or pattern filled strokes - I myself do not know all the possibilities for all the different digital textures, because they are too much.\nStrokes and their successors filled the shapes and the compositions, giving them the power to inspire thoughts, associations and emotions even better.\n\nOne of the things I find most exciting about this work is the way it invites interpretation. Although the shapes are abstract, they suggest something different to each viewer. Some may see a cityscape, others a landscape, others a microcosm of cells or molecules, space or a situation or emotion. The eye is drawn into the forms and follows the interplay of color, shape and texture.\n\nAt its core, this work is about the power of algorithmic art to create something beautiful and thought-provoking from simple building blocks. It's a testament to the endless possibilities of generative art, and I am excited to share it with the world.\n\nSo here it is. A non-representational geometric project with some fun elements to help you find your own meaning and purpose.\nIt could be happy or blue, serious or fun. Please, enjoy it and consume it in moderation.\n\nIf you have these rare qualities:\n- Dawn is near\n- Flexasaurus is crazy\n\npress \"n\", for a surprise!\n\nCapture in high resolution for printing / large displays:\n\n1. Open in IPFS.\n2. Press S - to redraw your work in 2160x20160px (UHD), and then right-click on the screen to Save.\n3. Add \"?res=2\" to the end of the URL and press S to double the resolution (4320x4320px) via higher pixelDensity().\n4. Add \"?res=3\" to triple the resolution.\n5. Keep increasing to break it.\n\nValid for PCs. On mobile, please just enjoy it. On Mac, the resolution is already too high!\n\np.p. The utility combo function will be used after it is sold out!",

            "description": "\"Before the Storm\" captures a fleeting moment of calmness amidst an impending tempest. Heavy clouds loom overhead, suffusing the air with palpable moisture and an alluring aroma. Majestic evergreens stand tall and proud, bravely facing the ominous yet strangely inviting sky. The air crackles with electrifying energy, foreshadowing the raw power of nature about to be unleashed. In this fleeting moment, one cannot help but be mesmerized by the sublime forces at play, but beware, the calm will not last forever.\n\nTechnical Note:\nIf you wish to render a high-quality version of your iteration, I strongly recommend increasing the resolution (press \"R\") and setting anti-aliasing to >1 (press \"A\"). However, be aware that it might take longer to compile and may not render at all on older hardware. To save the image, press \"S\".\n\nThe code has been tested on my old MacBook and on various Windows machines. For best results, use a modern Chromium-based browser, and make sure your browser supports WebGL 2.\n\nsuperbialux",
