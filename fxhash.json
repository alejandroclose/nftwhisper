Over 11 million metric tons of waste plastic enter our oceans every year. Thankfully, there is a growing force of ocean defenders rising to combat this crisis. Activists and non-profit organizations around the world are working diligently to solve the ocean plastic problem — but they don’t have nearly enough resources to succeed. This project aims to help.\n\nTurtle Vision uses code, chaos, and regl.js to offer us a glimpse into the experience of a sea turtle in 2023, struggling to survive in an ailing ocean. Turtles prey heavily on jellyfish, but have trouble distinguishing them from the countless plastic bags clogging our oceans given their similar shapes and movement patterns. Because of this, we are finding more and more sea turtles dead on beaches, having starved to death with bellies full of plastic bags.\n\nWe believe that generative art can help to reverse this trend and restore sea turtle populations to pre-plastic levels. Turtle Vision aims to raise money for 5 Gyres, one of the foremost nonprofit groups in the war on single-use plastic. 5 Gyres has a storied pedigree in this space, and has also emerged as a leader amongst conservation organizations in its embrace of blockchain technology.\n\nThis project is a collaboration between renowned generative artist @s_r_r_z, the creator of the iconic Generative Octopuses, and @Casson.tez, a professional ocean conservation activist who works at the intersection of environmentalism and web3.\n\nWe are grateful for the support of Tender.art, fx(hash), TZAPAC, the Tezos Foundation, and the entire Tezos community.\n\n\n## EDITION\n\n- Series size: 534 (it's SEA)\n- Price: 111-99-77-55-33\n- Charity share: 40% of primaries, 5% of secondaries\n\n\n## TECHNICALS\n\nVisuals:\nThis artwork portrays jellyfish intermixed with litter in the ocean, such as plastic bags and masks.

            "description": "An automatic painting journey\n\nAUTOJOURNEYPAINT  uses a series of custom built walkers to make plots with a great variety of properties, including packing gaps, directions and propensity for turning. These plots are then drawn over with varying, incremented pixel brushes.\n\nAUTOJOURNEYPAINT chooses color for itself from a broad list of more than 100 colors. It selects a palette of 8 but might not use all of them.\n\nThe background consists of a single color at the back and then one channel (either r, g, b) of the same color iterating from 0 to 255 while also iterating over a number of pixels within a border, all fixed to a pixel grid of variable size. The iteration over pixel numbers means the background produces very different patterns at different screen sizes\n\nIf you want to know more about the variables used they are output in the console log\n\nResponsive to screen size. Larger resolutions will implement more brush strokes.\n\nSome renders may be slower due to more complex collision detection in some brush settings.\n\nPress “s” to save the image as a png.",

Heavy clouds loom overhead, suffusing the air with palpable moisture and an alluring aroma. Majestic evergreens stand tall and proud, bravely facing the ominous yet strangely inviting sky. The air crackles with electrifying energy, foreshadowing the raw power of nature about to be unleashed. In this fleeting moment, one cannot help but be mesmerized by the sublime forces at play, but beware, the calm will not last forever.\n\nTechnical Note:\nIf you wish to render a high-quality version of your iteration, I strongly recommend increasing the resolution (press \"R\") and setting anti-aliasing to >1 (press \"A\"). However, be aware that it might take longer to compile and may not render at all on older hardware. To save the image, press \"S\".\n\nThe code has been tested on my old MacBook and on various Windows machines. For best results, use a modern Chromium-based browser, and make sure your browser supports WebGL 2.\n\nsuperbialux",

            "description": "## PROJECT DESCRIPTION\n\nWhat is it like to be a sea turtle in the age of plastic?\n\nOur global addiction to single-use plastic is destroying our marine environment. Over 11 million metric tons of waste plastic enter our oceans every year. Thankfully, there is a growing force of ocean defenders rising to combat this crisis. Activists and non-profit organizations around the world are working diligently to solve the ocean plastic problem — but they don’t have nearly enough resources to succeed. This project aims to help.\n\nTurtle Vision uses code, chaos, and regl.js to offer us a glimpse into the experience of a sea turtle in 2023, struggling to survive in an ailing ocean. Turtles prey heavily on jellyfish, but have trouble distinguishing them from the countless plastic bags clogging our oceans given their similar shapes and movement patterns. Because of this, we are finding more and more sea turtles dead on beaches, having starved to death with bellies full of plastic bags.\n\nWe believe that generative art can help to reverse this trend and restore sea turtle populations to pre-plastic levels. Turtle Vision aims to raise money for 5 Gyres, one of the foremost nonprofit groups in the war on single-use plastic. 5 Gyres has a storied pedigree in this space, and has also emerged as a leader amongst conservation organizations in its embrace of blockchain technology.\n\nThis project is a collaboration between renowned generative artist @s_r_r_z, the creator of the iconic Generative Octopuses, and @Casson.tez, a professional ocean conservation activist who works at the intersection of environmentalism and web3.\n\nWe are grateful for the support of Tender.art, fx(hash), TZAPAC, the Tezos Foundation, and the entire Tezos community.\n\n\n## EDITION\n\n- Series size: 534 (it's SEA)\n- Price: 111-99-77-55-33\n- Charity share: 40% of primaries, 5% of secondaries\n\n\n## TECHNICALS\n\nVisuals:\nThis artwork portrays jellyfish intermixed with litter in the ocean, such as plastic bags and masks.

            "description": "1) INTRO (MUST READ)\n\"Emotions\" is a unique Animated, watercolor or liquid painting-like abstract generative artwork which incorporates some \"innovative\" or unique techniques and approaches.\n\nIf find the above too selfish or wonder if its worth to buy this sh**t in a relative high price from an unknown \"artist\" please give some time to read the whole description. You will not regret!\n\nI don't like to talk about myself or using marketing expressions, however sometimes have to, in order to clarify some points & spot some important features\n\nAll started as an exercise to shaders on Nov. 2022 and is the completion of this experimentation (rotating colors): twitter.com/Uniray_net/status/1587588272842280961 \n\n\n2) SHORT BIO\nI was always between graphics & programming. Was very good in both areas (as my teachers were saying) & remember me also drawing from childhood \nThe first years i was focusing more in graphics (i was teaching graphics as well) and i was programming graphics for hobby\n\nFrom 2005 & later i started a turn in my career & made programming my profession for the last 13-14 years (developer in some private companies)\nIn 2020 I started again a more serious involvement with graphics without knowing anything about NFTs or WEB3. And from 2021 i started getting more & more involved. Still so many to learn\n\nI am new in gen art, started few months ago with plain javascript.\nStarted learning p5js in Aug. 2002 and shaders in Oct. 2022 & \"Emotions\" is my first \"large\" work. \nAlready published some simpler & old works (eg. 3D) & things i developed as i was learning\n\n3) FEATURES\nI think i am presenting something relatively different with \"Emotions\" & always try to apply one of my favorite motto: \"Lead, don't follow\"\n\nThe general experience in programming & the fact that i had already programmed graphics in conjunction with my love for experimentation & searching behind the things, helped me to incorporate in \"Emotions\" some \"innovative\" i believe features & techniques (it sounds selfish but let me explain)\n\n- First i am \"proud\" of the shader work. I developed completely custom \"advanced\" techniques that discovered after experimentation & some knowledge of course.\n\n- \"Emotions\" includes 51 palettes (with several color each) that have been stored externally (in the application folder) as Adobe \".act\" color table files so that avoiding hard coded (including all palettes in the code) consuming in this way resources eg. memory from user's system. I just load only the one palette i am going to use\n\n- A fast svg Convolution kernel Matrix filter along with a displacement filter used for the texture\n\n- Lastly & minor, you can switch Orientation (Portrait, Landscape, etc) & Resolution with the press of a key (no need to manually add params in the url)\n\nFrom the above the most important part is the webGL shader.\n\n4) CONCLUSION\n\"Emotions\" is an animated watercolor painting-like (or liquid pigments material) abstract \"live\" work, that instead of staying static, starting with an initial state & slowly flowing, changing shapes & colors as sometimes happens with our emotions & feelings which may changed over time. \nColors also represents emotions eg. red is for passion, green is the color of hope, etc \n\nGive some time to observe the progress and liquid feel and motion in shapes and colors.  Relax and look the flow and color diffusion - spread  & the whole \"painting\" to transformed slowly. \n\nKEYS:\n- 1-4: Set resolution from 1x to 4x of the current dimension (slower performance in higher values)\n- T: Texture on/off\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait (default). Aspect ratio 0.75\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape with ratio 4/3\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ between orientations\n\n- Spacebar: animation on/off\n\nMOUSE:\n- Click: animation on/off\n- Move: left - right on canvas (when in animation) to interact\n\n----\nMade with p5js & custom shaders. Pure code. No Images used\n\n© Dec. 2022  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

Or maybe it's all the drugs.\n\nA semi-abstract semi-figurative look at the city, either a cage or an ocean of possibilities, under a future sky that alternately oppresses and inspires.\n\n------- Viewport controls ( mobile in parenthesis ) -------\n- Mouse Wheel/Middle (Pinch) to zoom\n- Mouse left and drag (Two fingers drag) to pan (after zooming in).\n\n------- Menu -------\n!!! Press SPACE to show/hide the MENU. !!!\n\nIn this MENU you can :\n\n- Adjust the anti-aliasing quality : Default is \"medium\". Set it to \"ideal\" for optimal quality.\n- Aspect ratio : you can change the desired aspect ratio from the default \"Poster\" to \"Window\", in which case the piece resizes itself to fill the window in which it is displayed. Useful if you want to capture in other formats. It has its limits though, extreme ratios will be weird.\n- Display frame : toggle to hide/show the frame\n- Display stats : toggle to display a small FPS counter in the top left.\n- Export : choose the resolution and press the \"Export capture\" button to export a PNG of what is currently displayed. Warning : large resolutions can take a few seconds and weigh around 400Mo. This is the recommended method if you want CLEAN graphic files.\n\n------ Params ------\nFirst get a feel for the generator like for any gentk. Then I'd recommend picking a palette and locking it, then start playing with the different options and progressively lock them. Finally, either play with the fxhash seed or the \"Override seed\" parameter.\n\nThe \"Override seed\" param : Leave blank if you want to be surprised by your mint and design only a general look. Inversely, if you want to mint the precise artwork you see while designing, this field should have a value in it.\n\nNFT License\n\nRuns on Three.js : https://threejs.org/\nGUI uses lil-gui : https://www.npmjs.com/package/lil-gui",

There are seven composition types that produce different styles of output.\n\nThis project uses the fx(params) WYSIWYG functionality so the minter will get exactly the output they configure.\n\nExplanation of Numeric Params (all have range 0-100):\n\nXBounds - low values have primary structures near the middle of the horizontal axis\n\nYBounds - low values have primary structures near the middle of the vertical axis. For Quantized composition types this also affects the vertical level of the vanishing points.\n\nStructureSmooth - low values have a more complex global structure\n\nDetailSmooth - low values have a more complex fine structure\n\nSegmentLength - low values have more but shorter lines drawn\n\nAngleVariation - low values have more coherent line direction\n\nColorNoise - the higher the value the more random color variation for each line segment\n\nOrder - low values have the lines follow the flow fields in a more chaotic fashion\n\nBlur - higher values will use blur on top and bottom of output to simulate depth of field\n\nSymmetry - The possible values are no symmetry, 3, 4, 6, or 12. Any symmetry will be imperfect - it guides the construction of the composition but other random factors will usually prevent an exactly symmetrical result.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThere are some keyboard operations available.\n\nClick on the output and use these keys to affect it:\n's' - save at current resolution\n'2' - change to 2000 x 2000 resolution\n'3' - change to 3000 x 3000 resolution\n...\n'8' - change to 8000 x 8000 resolution\n\nNote that at higher resolutions there will be some minor variation in output.\n\nCopyright 2023 Jeff Clark\n--------------------------\n100% generative\n\nAll drawing and geometric code created by Jeff Clark using standard javascript and canvas 2D api. Perlin noise was used with support from perlin.js at https://codepen.io/sixsided/pen/emxxea.js\n\n",
