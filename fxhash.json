            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. \nwww.tribute-hwf.com\n\n“One criterion for art involves the process used by the artist for shaping the work. In the special case of mathematically supported fine art, the artmaking process occurs in a mathematically defined operation that allows the generation and transformation of images, methods used for picture processing.” - Herbert W. Franke\n\nI first came across Franke’s ‘Ornamental Alphabets’ in his book 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘎𝘳𝘢𝘱𝘩𝘪𝘤𝘴 - 𝘊𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘳 𝘈𝘳𝘵, and was intrigued with the idea of using a simple letterform to explore different generative image processing techniques. \n\nI’ve used letters and writing in my work for a long time, both with letterpress printing and in my asemic poetry programs. With asemic writing, I generate unrecognizable letters to reference text, and here I use recognizable letterforms removed from their typical function as language signifiers. \n\nMy goal with this project was to build as much texture and layering as possible by warping and collaging the letters together in various ways. The font I’m using is a design I made years ago to supplement my wood type collection for printing. I really enjoyed being able to bring that part of my past work into my generative art practice. \n\nEach image is composed of the letters found in the hash for that piece, divided into either vowels or consonants. The program builds on a technique I’ve used before, where I generate an image to an off-screen canvas and then dive through the pixels to pull out the color and form I want to surface in the final image.\n\n25% of the primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke. These funds will be used by ZKM Karlsruhe to digitize Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any additional funds raised will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n- Press “R” to increase the pixel density and reload the image (this can be render intensive and will create a really large file suitable for printing)\n- Press “S” to save a copy\n\nMade with p5js\nArtist: Sarah Ridgley\nOctober, 2022",

Collectors should still look closely and choose what they like when buying on secondary.\n\nWhich team are you on? X or O?\n\nfollow culla on twitter for updates. Or maybe __acolyte__\n\nIf the non reserved tokens mint out quickly, Access List mints will have 24 hours to mint reserves assigned to those wallets\n\nThank you for supporting an emerging artist in the generative art space\n\nAccess List reserves were given to holders of the following PFP collections created by culla\n2x for each Basqunk held\n1x for each Inkspunk, TwoFourQunk, V0iD, DeeManz, Punkasso and CR0$$KULL\nYou would have needed to transfer the above tokens to your mint wallet at the time of the snapshot\n\nshare your tokens on social media with #genxyznft\nMade with love by culla using p5.js",

What we think is artificial is but nature's inclination.\n\nAs an atom gazes at the world it can see the arrogant hand of mankind imposing its will. We are nature's inane creation built from imperceptible, discrete particles.\n\nEnjoy watching the structures form. Due to the nature of the system it may take some time to complete.

            "description": "'Part:Counterpart' is an experiment in form, disintegration, and context. Each work is created within one of three modes, Part, Counterpart, or Part:Counterpart.\n\nIn experimenting, I've enjoyed taking a simple composition and breaking it down with various methods. This transforms the original composition into something new, but it also begins to lose what the original had to say. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I want to dive a little deeper and explore ideas as a sort of tangible substance. Already we're comparing ideas against their translations and evolutions, but what happens if we present them both within the context of the other?\n\nAdditionally, what if we present both of these ideas with echoes and tangents, discussion around the ideas and their practical applications instead of imagined? Sure, these aren't our idea, or even our translation, but they exist only because the originals do.\n\nHow does this change our opinion of the original? Is every idea destined to be picked apart and reimagined forever until it bears only a faint resemblance? Where is the line between our Counterpart and an echo?\n\nThis piece hopes to inspire contemplation on the nature of storytelling and artistic inspiration.\n\n10% of ideas are encrypted to obscure the original Part.\nPress ’s’ to save a 3600x4500 png.\nPress ‘p’ to save the original Part, pure and untouched.",
