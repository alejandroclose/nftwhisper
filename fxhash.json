            "description": "\"The Pure Zone\" is a captivating and visually stunning form of artistic expression. \nIt is characterized by its use of clean lines, minimalistic designs, and a focus on creating a sense of purity and tranquility.\nI employed a limited color palette, consisting mainly of neutral tones such as whites, grays, and pastels. This deliberate choice enhances the overall sense of calm and simplicity in the artwork.\nThe subject in \"The Pure Zone\" is abstract representations of emotions or concepts. The aim is to evoke a feeling of serenity and inner peace through this artwork.\nOne notable feature of \"The Pure Zone\" is its meticulous attention to detail. Each line and stroke is purposefully placed to create a harmonious composition that draws the viewer's eye into the artwork. This attention to detail adds depth and dimension to the piece while maintaining its overall minimalist aesthetic.\n\n\"The Pure Zone\" serves as a visual reminder to find beauty in simplicity and embrace moments of stillness in our busy lives.\n\nControllers (Save as PNG)\n[S] - [2480*3508]\n[1] - [4960*7016]\n[2] - [7440*10524]\n[3] - [9920*14032]\n[4] - [12400*17540]\n\nMade by p5.js",

I used circles of different sizes, colors, textures, and opacity to create depth and visual interest, and added compositions like squiggly lines for complexity and variety.\nThe possibilities are endless when it comes to circles, as they have the freedom to experiment with different techniques and styles. It can take many forms including minimal, abstract designs, mandalas (spiritual symbols), optical illusions or even representational images made entirely of circles.\nBy focusing on the simplicity and versatility of circles, I have created a visual approach that evokes harmony, unity, and balance while also allowing for creative expression.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

Each strand, like a thread of a tapestry, weaves a narrative of the self that is inseparable from the whole. Walking through a thick confusion, you see a solitary slice of the self in each iteration. \n\nCreated in Cables.gl, \"Now There’s None of You Left\" is made from layers of randomly generated transparent shapes and various noise textures that are then distorted with a combination of Perlin and Simplex noise. The distortion is also built up in multiple layers, making the shapes sometimes overlay or coil over each other. All these layers of shapes, textures, noises, and distortions create a complex composition that illustrates distorted memories and eroded mind. The resulting scene can look tranquil, sometimes violent, sometimes almost empty. Strands of memory, tendrils of emotions, all brewing in the broth of forgetfulness. And in the midst of this dense confusion, you pray to find a glimpse of clarity. Are you still you, or are you me?\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024 (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example, to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot at rendered resolution in live view\n\nNote:\nThere might be a very slight difference in the minor details between live view and the preview image rendered by fxhash engine. This discrepancy won't appear when you capture a screenshot using the built-in keyboard shortcut.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "Orbit of Influence is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, ZeroSpace NYC, 2023 and is a unique generative program created using processing's p5js and SVG. Developed from scratch, it employs a system of rule-based environments that have been a source of satisfaction for me since 1995.\n\nThe program generates three invisible planets, each at a different scale - small, medium, and large. Fifty objects then randomly select a planet, a speed to orbit around it, and one of three brush sizes - small, medium, or large. These objects move around their respective planets, painting color and texture across the planetary orbit in three-dimensional space.\n\nTo reveal the blueprint of the system, press the \"s\" key on your keyboard. The hidden algorithm that governs the brushes' movement is then displayed, revealing a mesmerizing display of synchronized choreography as the brushes interconnect with each other.\n\nPress the following keys to interact :\n\n- '1': swap the background color to \"ocean\"\n- '2': swap the background color to \"mist\"\n- '3': swap the background color to \"lilac\"\n- '4': swap the background color to \"amethyst\"\n- '5': swap the background color to \"crimson\"\n- '6': swap the background color to \"emerald\"\n\n- 'l': toggle animation loop on/off\n- 's': system reveal, show the blueprint of the algorithm\n\nJoshua Davis / PrayStation 'Orbit of Influence' / (2023) real-time generative program, 1240 x 1653 px, Date Minted: April 2023\n\nTwitter: @joshuadavis\nInstagram: @praystation\nWebsite: https://joshuadavis.com\n\nBio :\n\nSince 1995, Joshua Davis is an artist, technologist, author and designer in algorithmic image making & animation. Using programming, he writes his own code to produce interactions with users and to generate visual compositions according to rule-based, randomized processes.\n\nJoshua has exhibited his works and/or lectured at the Ars Electronica (Austria), Centre Georges Pompidou (France), Contemporary Arts Center (Cincinnati), J. Paul Getty Museum (Los Angeles),  the Tate Modern (London), the Design Museum (London), the Institute of Contemporary Arts (London), PS.1 MoMA (New York), the Whitney (New York), the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum (New York), the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (Spain), among others.\n\nSince 2000, Joshua has lectured globally about his work, inspirations and motivations at museums, galleries, institutions, art festivals, etc., and has spoken at the TED (2005) and 99U (2013) conferences about his career in algorithmic image making and open source.",

            "description": "The inspiration for this work stems from Ilya Kabakov’s series 'Holidays’.\nCreated in 1987, this collection of twelve paintings delves into the complex emotions of contradiction and duality. It explores the discord between external reality and an individual's internal psychological state, highlighting moments when the outer world fails to align with one's inner experiences. The notion of a 'holiday' within the series implies a yearning to escape reality, if only temporarily.\n\nThe artwork achieves a sense of depth through intricate compositions and a play of interacting layers. Over the abstract background, which inherits the plasticity and color palette from our previous works, we superimpose a regular grid, reminiscent of sweets and candy wrappers.\nIn our ever-changing world of perpetual decay and renewal, we constantly seek ways to restore and rediscover joy.\n\nKey commands to save hi-res PNG images:\n1 = 1024 px (width)\n2 = 2048 px\n...\n6 = 6144 px\n\nMade together with YulikolaY, love, AI and p5.js code.\n\nOctober, 2023",
