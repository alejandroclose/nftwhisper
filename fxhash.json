            "description": "A study of building and destroying. I built this. You may knock it over.\n\nHumans are both creators and destroyers. One of the earliest games children learn to play is building with blocks, then knocking them down. This simple activity is teaching kids about gravity, cause and effect, and imposing their will on the world around them. As children grow older, the gap between these opposing actions widens. The intention behind knocking things down becomes less innocent, and creators aren't as excited to see their work destroyed.\n\nIn 1915, the Russian avant-garde founded the abstract art movement known as Constructivism, rejecting everything except for the absolute purest aspects of form and material. This art was used in service of the Russian revolution and utilized heavily in its propaganda, intended to highlight the utilitarian nature of industrial progress. Mainly, building the new Russia. Its influence is lasting, and can be seen throughout art and design trends even today.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, footage of missiles and airstrikes decimating Ukrainian buildings permeated the media. Ukrainian lives, kitchens, windowsill gardens, and family photos tumbled to the ground. Like children's blocks. Things that took a lifetime to build were destroyed in seconds. \n\nKONSTRUKTS represents this duality in creation and destruction. Stacked children's blocks are rendered in the style of Constructivist designs like El Lissitzky's Proun series, and Alexander Rodchenko's posters. With a simple tap, blocks (or buildings) can be knocked to the ground.\n\n- Tap anywhere to reveal the KONSTRUKTS menu in the top left. Tap the menu for several options.\n- KONSTRUKTS can be exported as USDZ or GLTF models to be used in augmented reality or the metaverse.\n- Export a full resolution PNG image from the menu.\n- If you knocked over the blocks, you can reset them from the menu.\n\nKONSTRUKTS is built entirely with code, using Three.js, JavaScript, and GLSL.",

            "description": "A study of building and destroying. I built this. You may knock it over.\n\nHumans are both creators and destroyers. One of the earliest games children learn to play is building with blocks, then knocking them down. This simple activity is teaching kids about gravity, cause and effect, and imposing their will on the world around them. As children grow older, the gap between these opposing actions widens. The intention behind knocking things down becomes less innocent, and creators aren't as excited to see their work destroyed.\n\nIn 1915, the Russian avant-garde founded the abstract art movement known as Constructivism, rejecting everything except for the absolute purest aspects of form and material. This art was used in service of the Russian revolution and utilized heavily in its propaganda, intended to highlight the utilitarian nature of industrial progress. Mainly, building the new Russia. Its influence is lasting, and can be seen throughout art and design trends even today.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022, footage of missiles and airstrikes decimating Ukrainian buildings permeated the media. Ukrainian lives, kitchens, windowsill gardens, and family photos tumbled to the ground. Like children's blocks. Things that took a lifetime to build were destroyed in seconds. \n\nKONSTRUKTS represents this duality in creation and destruction. Stacked children's blocks are rendered in the style of Constructivist designs like El Lissitzky's Proun series, and Alexander Rodchenko's posters. With a simple tap, blocks (or buildings) can be knocked to the ground.\n\n- Tap anywhere to reveal the KONSTRUKTS menu in the top left. Tap the menu for several options.\n- KONSTRUKTS can be exported as USDZ or GLTF models to be used in augmented reality or the metaverse.\n- Export a full resolution PNG image from the menu.\n- If you knocked over the blocks, you can reset them from the menu.\n\nKONSTRUKTS is built entirely with code, using Three.js, JavaScript, and GLSL.",

            "description": "- Last day with the dying planet -\n\nA sentimental start.\n\nIt is the last day of this planet, you once lived and shared so many meaningful memories.\n\nTake a last good look at the places of the planet. Look to the far side. You see people were leaving already. But you loved the planet so much that you dare to risk and stay a bit longer before you leave.\n\nThis moment becomes bottomless. Landscapes glitter vividly with altered gradients, fog emits at the far end of the land, and Energy leaks and escapes from the core, thru the cracks in form of aurora structure.\n\nIt is a mix of sadness, grief, missing, and anxiety.\nIt is the end.\nIt is breathtaking.\nIt makes you hesitate.\n\n// About the scene\nThe planet was vast.\nYou may experience Rocky Sierra, Fluidy Mountains, Wide Dunes, and even Calm Ocean.\n\nThe Breakdown\nIn the rare case, you might be able to see a highly pixelated/extreme wide/flat landscape with finely emitted aurora, which is considered a rare scene. i.e. absolute strength of light vs breakdown of limited matters.\n\n// About the presentation style\nThe Texture & The Drawing : Heavily inspired by pencil sketching techniques that emphasize shading and outline relationship towards an angular light source.\n\nApply color scheme from other Astro objects to give an alternative look for the planet.\n\nThe Animation Sequence: Custom storytelling algorithms combine the formation of the aurora, landscape, and scene detail all in a timeline. The resulting sequential narrative style illustrates the history of the landscape and the aurora formation.\n\nNot just giving the collector the final look but also sharing the cause and reason of such composition.\n\nThe Tiny Zoom: A tiny zoom-out movement is implemented in the piece to echo the theme of the piece. i.e. leaving and departing the planet.\n\n// About the Music\nTwo theme songs were made for this piece.\n\nTheme I: [Solitude]\nTheme II: [Fragmented]\n\nBoth songs were made to present the process of departure: the sleep of the planet and the awakening of the observer.\n\n// Metaphor\nWe face departure and arrival all the time. They might be the best or the worst memories of our life. Whether you are willing to or not.\n\nThe ending is an ongoing process and on the other side of the Ending comes the beginning.\n\nIt is ok to be sentimental.\n\n// Control\nBest viewed in large and wide proportion.\n(Open in new window)\n\n[S] - save the scene once the drawing stops\n[L] - leave and take a look at other places\n[Mouse Click] - click twice to initiate music. then click one to mute/show\n\n\n- 與垂死星球的最後一天 -\n\n從感傷開始。\n\n這是你曾經生活在的星球之最後一天，你們的關係將要結束，許多有意義的回憶也將封印成回憶。\n\n看看遠方。其他人已經開始離開了。\n你還留著，想好好看看這個星球。\n\n你請願冒險，也要在離開之前多停留一段時間。\n\n此刻像是無限。景觀隨著漸變的顏色而變得更加生動，在陸地的遠端散發出最後的火霧，能量從核心洩漏，以極光狀的結構從裂縫中逸出。\n\n它是悲傷、內疚、思念和焦慮的混合體。\n這是結束。\n但又嘆為觀止。\n讓你猶豫不決。\n\n// 關於現場\n這個星球曾經很大\n您會經歷到寂靜的岳峰、流動的山脈、寬闊的沙丘以及平靜的海洋。\n\n罕見的一刻 - 物質崩壞\n在極少數情況下，您可能會看到極寬/平坦/鋸齒化的景觀與高像素細膩的極光並存，即光的絕對強度與有限的物質瓦解。\n\n// 關於演示風格\n紋理與繪畫風格 : 深受鉛筆素描技術的啟發，這些技術強調與角光源的陰影和輪廓關係。\n\n應用其他天文物體的配色方案，為地球提供另一種外觀。\n\n動畫序列 : 自定義敘事算法將極光、風景和場景細節的形成全部結合在一個時間軸中。由此產生的順序敘述風格，說明了景觀的歷史和極光的形成。\n\n不僅給收藏家最終的外觀，而且還分享了這種構圖的原因和原因。\n\n小變焦 : 作品中實施了微小的縮小運鏡，以呼應作品的主題 - 離開。\n\n// 關於音樂\n為作品製作了兩首主題曲。\n\n主題一：【獨】\n主題二：【碎】\n\n兩首歌表達/呈現離開的過程：星球的沉睡和觀察者的覺醒。\n\n// 隱喻\n不管你願不願意，我們無時無刻都面臨著離去和到來。離去前它們是我們一生中最美好/最糟糕的回憶。\n\n結局是一維，離開是二維的，另一端叫作開始。\n\n覺得感傷是ok 的。\n\n// 控制\n但在大寬視窗下視覺效果最好\n(Open in new window)\n\n[S] - 繪圖停止後存取畫作\n[L] - 離開去其他地方看看\n[鼠標單擊] - 單擊兩次以啟動音樂。 然後單擊一個靜音/顯示",
