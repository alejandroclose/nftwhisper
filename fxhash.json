By that, I do not mean that I want to know what you are doing as an individual person, but rather what the whole of us is to achieve. Am I responsible for myself or am I responsible for you too? Am I responsible for what every single person does, or for what we collectively do as a group? Both? Neither? \n\nWhat does it mean to live together?\n\n===\n\nTrame communale is a generative architecture project.\n\nThe generator is made to produce 64 iterations of buildings whose structures are consistent with most plastic bricks brands.\n\nIterations can be virtually loaded in the anaverse under a new \"village\" system, which loads them all in a same space (positioned according to their order of creation).\n\nEvery owner inhabits the same commune.",

It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

Generally, cells are formed when the stripes intersect to form a mesh or grid. Each cell formed by these stripes can be filled with a color to create a design.\nI love the way I can play with the horizontality and verticality of the stripes to create unique and original geometric patterns, and how through different sizes of stripes an infinity of pieces are formed ranging from the minimalist and sophisticated to the most colorful and expressive, bringing each piece a fresh and current air within a vibrant color palette.\nThe DNA of this collection is my passion for stripes and colors, both united in a single project that reflects my love in each piece.\nI hope you enjoy it as much as I do!\n",

            "description": "“Raoul Pictor cherche son style…” (Raoul Pictor is looking for his style…) was launched in Saint-Gall, Switzerland, in 1993. It consists of a Mac LC computer, a 12-inch color screen, and an HP 500C printer.\nThe program presents an animation in which we can observe an artist, Raoul Pictor, working in his studio. He paints, paces while deep in thought, consults books from his library, plays the piano, and enjoys red wine. The sequence of these activities is non-linear. The canvas is seen from behind, resting on the easel in the center of the room. We are unable to see what is being painted. Once his painting is complete, he picks it up and exits through a side door. It is at this moment that the printer springs into action, delivering his unique, dated, and signed work.\nThis project has been exhibited in numerous exhibitions around the world. Subsequently, a Flash version, \"Raoul Pictor Web Studio,\" was developed to make it available on the internet (2001). In 2013, for its 20th anniversary, an iOS version, \"Raoul Pictor Mega Painter,\" was developed in collaboration with the great Matthieu Cherubini (mchrbn.net). \nIn 2023, for its 30th anniversary, an update seemed necessary to continue the adventure on the fx(hash) platform – thank you for making all of this possible! The development of this first fx version (“Country Spirit I”) was greatly enhanced by the wonderful support and expertise of the sha22.art team as well as our friends. Additional collections are now planned for the near future or special events...\n\n[up_arrow], [space bar] : Painter jumps in first part of animation.\n\n[p], [mouse click], [touch screen] : Save the painting when it is displayed.",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

It consists of a Mac LC computer, a 12-inch color screen, and an HP 500C printer.\nThe program presents an animation in which we can observe an artist, Raoul Pictor, working in his studio. He paints, paces while deep in thought, consults books from his library, plays the piano, and enjoys red wine. The sequence of these activities is non-linear. The canvas is seen from behind, resting on the easel in the center of the room. We are unable to see what is being painted. Once his painting is complete, he picks it up and exits through a side door. It is at this moment that the printer springs into action, delivering his unique, dated, and signed work.\nThis project has been exhibited in numerous exhibitions around the world. Subsequently, a Flash version, \"Raoul Pictor Web Studio,\" was developed to make it available on the internet (2001). In 2013, for its 20th anniversary, an iOS version, \"Raoul Pictor Mega Painter,\" was developed in collaboration with the great Matthieu Cherubini (mchrbn.net). \nIn 2023, for its 30th anniversary, an update seemed necessary to continue the adventure on the fx(hash) platform – thank you for making all of this possible! The development of this first fx version (“Country Spirit I”) was greatly enhanced by the wonderful support and expertise of the sha22.art team as well as our friends.
