It represents the generative processes driving fxhash tokens. Generative Tokens are fed with a unique hash to produce unique outputs based on the hash — they are functions with a hash as single input.\n\nThe growth that comes out of the text is driven by a \"Dividing-Aggregating Walkers\" (DAW) algorithm. The hash drives all the DAW settings, as well as a mutation factor which is responsible for changes in each Walker parameters as they divide.\n\nSome iterations will produce very simple outputs whereas others might be more chaotic.\n\nPiece by @ciphrd for fxhash",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch B remains simple. The basic grid of Sketch A is there, but is starting to be filled. Grid lines are trimmed as if sketched. Colors continue to be borrowed from Echos/Orbits and new colors from Bent are incorporated. Grid size, padding, line thickness, fill color, and fill percentage and patterns vary.",

            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

            "description": "Released on the occasion of the Tribute to Herbert W. Franke. www.tribute-hwf.com\n\n\"Since the classical age of Greece, the golden ratio has been well known as the most balanced and therefore most aesthetically perfect proportion. In fact, it is supposedly often found in the fine arts and architecture and it is certainly important in geometry. But where is the proof that it is really the most beautiful proportion?\n\n\"The computer is proving to be a useful tool in exact art theory. Works of computer art are produced with the help of programs that describe the logic of the construction and its relevant measures. By varying the parameters you can vary the shapes of objects, and on the basis of the reaction of the public you can determine the best option. So it is possible to find valid rules to design works of art.\n\n\"A statistical evaluation would be interesting. Please email me with your results for the optimal proportion.\"\n\nI found it heartwarming that in 2011, Herbert W. Franke wrote the above, accompanied with a simple functional program on a Wolfram Demonstration page (https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/IsTheGoldenRatioReallyTheMostBeautifulProportion/) titled 'Is the Golden Ratio Really the Most Beautiful Proportion?' and invited people to submit their findings to him.\n\nThe main idea behind this project is ratios, a variety of them, used in a variety of ways, such as how a rectangle is repeatedly subdivided, or how it influences the aspect ratio of the piece, or how the colors in a palette are selected. These are represented in various styles, some of which are inspired by the aesthetic of Herbert W. Franke's diverse artworks, and his openness to experimentation with new technologies, such as plotter drawings, screens, screenprints, or 2D and 3D digital renderings.\n\nThis project, while not designed to be a formal statistical evaluation, is but my fun, colorful, and humble response to your inquiry, dear Herbert.\n\n---\n\n25% of primary sales will be donated on-chain to the Foundation Herbert W. Franke, with the goal of raising 20,000 Euros so that ZKM Karlsruhe can digitize Herbert W. Franke’s 1,800 manuscripts and make them publicly available. Any money raised beyond this goal will be donated to the Rütgers Foundation which supports children and young adults in Africa so that they can get access to and work with technology.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• Double-click/tap or 'R' reassembles the piece (This automatically happens every minute)\n\nNote: Some mints require WEBGL and/or may take several seconds to fully render.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid",

            "description": "This is an album of cities too ideal to ever materialise.\n\nIt consists of 256 algorithmically generated plans that resemble drawings of Vincenzo Scamozzi, Pietro Cataneo, Filarete and other theorists of the Italian Renaissance. The cities differ in size, the grid of the streets, the landscape around them and the people that inhabit their utopian walls. They carry names that are Italian exonyms of real European cities, drawing a vision of a different world that enacts a mixture of military perfection with social superiority. Flawless, harmonious, unconquerable and utterly impossible.\n\nHistory brought us many theories about ideal cities, but very few examples exist today. Italian Palmanova or Polish Zamość are the few to remind us how hard it is to shape reality according to ideals. When confronted with the material world, its idealism becomes the city's grates foe.\n\nTo zoom, press a mouse button over the image or touch the screen.

With this option checked, the piece may need to process for up to a minute before rendering begins, but subsequently the rendering will proceed much more quickly than normal. This can be used to generate high-quality captures more quickly than when the option is not checked.\n\nWhen the \"filtering\" option is checked, a noise filter will be applied to the result of the render, reducing the appearance of noise.\n\nThe \"logic multiple\" slider can be used to multiply the amount of rendering work done each frame. Increasing this number may allow the piece to render more quickly, but may also make the page laggy. It is not recommended to increase this number unless you have a powerful GPU.",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

            "description": "WHISPERS (in code) is part of the fx(hash) interactive minting experience at Performance in Code: Deciphering Value in Generative Art, Art Basel Miami Beach, 2022. \nThe project is a collaborative performance between the viewer and AI. It reverses the usual approach of using AI as a tool to perform our intents (as in popular prompt-based AI methods) and gives the decision-making power to the AI, where we, humans, receive instructions on how to proceed in the creative process. Interaction happens in a multi-stage manner, in a metaphor for the process of training neural networks. At each step, after the user performs the action, they can send the image for evaluation by the neural network and receive another instruction (similarly to how networks learn by receiving feedback from the loss function).  What makes us different from the machines, however, is the presence of free will, and our ability to disobey the machine’s guidance. We are not restricted to its instructions and are free to interact with and break the artwork. \n\nArtwork is built on layers of photography, AI, GAN, diffusion, classification convolutional networks, random pixel manipulations, and user interaction. Like with most artist projects, it starts with a few memories, that are then re-imagined by GAN. The initial building blocks are a combination of photographs and AI outputs. The apparent lack of coherent subject choice in input images signifies how we build the perception of the world around us and apply an individual hierarchy to elements worth remembering. The blocks are then stripped of meaning by reducing them to abstract shapes and applying stochastic image transformations, guided by randomness. The neural network then learns to classify the images and outputs its best guesses on how to improve the pictures. \n \nThe goal of the project is to explore the controversial question of authorship through the use of tools incorporating AI. Does it lie with decisive or executive power? Here, the boundaries are blurred and one can no longer distinguish the clear author of a finished artwork - is it the artist, AI, serendipity, or viewer? \n\n\n- Use your mouse to perform machine instructions.\n- Use the \"E\" key to ask the neural network for instructions.\n- Use the \"R\" key to reset the drawing.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.\n",

How will they be arranged, \nand what will they sound like\nwhen they arrive at their destination?\nWhat will they be doing?\nWhat will the world be doing?\nWill the words be quiet or loud?\nWill they be full of themselves,\nor full of longing,\nor full of longing’s opposite?”\n \nAn ars poetica on the future of literature and humanity. \n \nThis project is a one-time generative poetry performance of a transhuman text by Sasha Stiles and her AI alter ego, Technelegy – read and unread by an algorithm authored by Nathaniel Stern. Every hash transforms one of 353 lines of AI-written poetry from legible letters into wordless language, generating a unique textblock from millions of possible combinations; each algorithmic translation unwrites itself, forever. Press \"s\" to overlay and toggle the original line of verse, and watch its shapes and meanings degenerate – or evolve – into an infinite visual poem.\n \nAll minters will receive an airdropped broadside (mp4) of the entire original poem after the performance is complete. A 1/1 media-rich audiovisual version of THE WORD AFTER US will also be made available.\n\n \nPoetic traits:\n- 353 possible lines of generative poetry produced by a GPT-3 language model fine-tuned on Stiles’ and Stern’s writing and research.\n- 28 possible color palette combinations selected from Stern’s performative scanner art, with rare palettes including RGB, Hacker, Charcoal, and Chalkboard (black background).\n- 6 possible fonts, including the premiere of Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer.”\n- millions of layout and layering possibilities, including a rare “spiral” effect.\n- billions of animation attribute combinations, which carry on forever.",
