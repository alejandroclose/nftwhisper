            "description": "\"the Pazyryk\"\n\"In the years 1326 to 1328 of the Solar Hijri calendar (equivalent to 1947â€“1949 AD), during a time when the Pazyryk carpet, the world's oldest known carpet, was discovered by Sergei Rudenko, a Russian archaeologist, in the Pazyryk Valley. This woolen carpet, adorned with vibrant colors, depicts images of horse riders, grazing deer, and mythical creatures.\n\nIn 'the Pazyryk' collection, inspired by the Pazyryk carpet and the exquisite artistry of carpets and kilims from the eastern regions, an exceptional display of the essence of color in abstract art has emerged. This collection has transformed into a comprehensive exhibition of timeless historical and artistic endeavors, offering viewers an innovative and profound experience through a wide spectrum of colors and artistic creativity.\n\nThe Pazyryk collection has been meticulously designed using 153 different color palettes and three distinct sizes with high resolution suitable for printing. This collection aims to present the colors, essence, and art of the eastern regions to the audience. Each color palette acts as a testimony to the amalgamation of emotions and insights of prominent artists throughout art history. Every color palette has been meticulously derived from the works of these famous artists, representing a fusion of interpretation and personal perspective. These palettes convey an abstract representation of artistic and technological trends, where color and coding techniques blend harmoniously.\n\nBy merging historical art with contemporary innovations, The Pazyryk reflects a living connection between the history of art and contemporary artistic currents. In this piece, I have endeavored to provide the audience with an abstract bridge for a deeper understanding of new art and creativity.

The series is inspired by the human-led speciation of plants such as orchids and irises, and animals such as goldfish and betta fish - whose features are often exaggerated. Not all speciation is towards ornament - our ancestors developed foods and natural materials through years of selection and hybridization, and this is continued today helping discover new resilient forms. Our ability to imagine and reshape living organisms as well as entire ecosystems is brought into focus through climate change. \n\nThe name Aluna is based on the philosophy of the Tairona people of Colombia, survived through present-day descendants. This Andean philosophy maintains a fundamentally different perspective about the role of humans - occupied with the imagining, enhancement, and nurturing of life.",
