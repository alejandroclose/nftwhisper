            "description": "\"Garden, Monoliths\" is the result of an algorithm that started in April 2021. It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "In Flow is the first in a series of four projects exploring flow fields, produced with 100% code in p5.js.  This one has a consistent gap between flow lines and a low noise resolution, producing a wispy effect that often looks like thread or felt.  Sometimes the background is a bit garish, which can be fun.  There's a good chance some texture will be added in the end, either mixing the colors and softening, or adding a fine paper texture.  It finishes off with a grain shader by Dave Pegurek found here: https://editor.p5js.org/davepagurek/sketches/m6p09ERHx\n\nAfter opening, hit 2 - 5 for higher pixel densities, and 's' to save a png. Resizing the canvas reverts to pixel density 1.\n\nCome visit my YouTube channel for generative art how-to videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjYUJudUW67Tg79jtF_rpQ",

Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.

In a way it is a continuation of my previous works \"Contraformas\" and \"Similarity\".\n\nThe principle of emergence can occur through the combination of the following factors: number of paths, movement pattern of the walker, the separation of the paths from each other, the length and minimum of each path, the frequency with which these variables change, the position of the camera in the z axis, the decrease in the size of the boxes, whether or not the boxes have borders, the size of the borders, the color of the palette, the range of variation of the color, the distance of the lights for each box, and some other rules.\n\n3 available aspect ratios\n2400 pixels high\nMore than 40 color palettes\n3 canvas color styles\n2 styles of boxes\n\nPress \"S\" to save a png image\nPress \"T\" to save a tiff image (may take time, canvastotiff.js)\n\ncreated by @mdollinger using p5js",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "As a lifelong enthusiast of all things furry, I am continually captivated by the soft and luxurious feel of fur and the many forms it takes in the natural world. From wild animals velvety coats to the comfort of plush blankets and pillows, fur has a special quality that evokes warm and cozy feelings.\n\nFor many people, the touch of soft fur on their skin brings back memories of the safety and security of home. This sense of comfort can be especially powerful, providing a refuge from the turmoil and unpredictability of the outside world.\n\nWhether it is the shimmering pile of a top-quality carpet, the fluffiness of a cherished pet, or the stiff and rough fur of a bristly shepherd dog, the texture and appearance of fur is truly mesmerizing. It is not surprising that it has been a subject of human fascination throughout history and continues to be so even today.\n\nWith this project, I attempted to embody that cozy feeling by experimenting with various shapes and techniques while still maintaining a furry appearance.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\n\nThe generation of a hi-res image, up to 8.000x8.000 pixels, takes some time and you can see the drawing process happening in real-time.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters and pressing the following keys the artwork will regenerate at a different scale:\n\n- 1 -> 2.160x2.160\n- 2 -> 4.000x4.000\n- 3 -> 6.000x6.000\n- 4 -> 8.000x8.000\n\n=============> PROFILES <==============\n\nThere are 15 distinct profiles, each with varying levels of rarity:\n\nShattered -----> 18%\nInvalidated ---> 10%\nIntersect -----> 9%\nStrippy -------> 7.5%\nSweater -------> 6.5%\nSmally --------> 6.5%\nKasparov ------> 6.5%\nTriangle ------> 6%\nShell ---------> 6%\nMononoke ------> 6%\nSpiral --------> 4.5%\nSplatter ------> 4.5%\nSquiggle ------> 4%\nMcFly ---------> 3%\nKocinski ------> 2%\n\nThe \"Invalidated\" profile features a unique mode that can occur with a 7.7% chance, which includes blood marks as a tribute to a personal story that frequently came to mind during the development of this project.\n\nAs a child, I once snuck into the kitchen with the intention of stealing some Torrone while my mother was sleeping on the couch in the living room. I used a chair to reach the cupboard and was able to successfully obtain the sweet grail. I then grabbed a large knife to cut it, but while I was putting all my effort into cutting the hard candy, I failed to remove my left hand from under it. As a result, the blade sliced through the tip of my middle finger, causing me to start bleeding profusely. I ran to my mother, crying for help. When she woke up and saw me, she scolded me, saying: \"Move away from the carpet! You're ruining it with all that blood!\"\n\nI still bear a distinct line-shaped scar on my fingerprint today.\n\n=============> MAMIE <==============\n\nThis project is a tribute to my beloved grandmother Lucille, who recently passed away. Regrettably, I was unable to attend her funeral and I wanted to express my reverence for her wonderful spirit in this way. Her home in Blanquefort was abundant with soft and plushy surfaces, ranging from moquettes and carpets to stuffed toys and velvety cushions. As a child, it felt like the coziest place on earth.\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\n\nPowered by p5 and chroma.",
