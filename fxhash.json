We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "Energomorphy: Form in Energy.\n\nThis generative system emerged from a technical process as I implemented a particle system within my GPU-based GIF painting workflow. While allowing for the free and independent movement of each particle, I aimed for the system to remain controlled, deterministic, and capable of seamless looping. Encapsulating these particles within animated geometric shapes opened a window for observing energy flows and kinetics as forces that shape ever-evolving forms.\n\nThe shapes that constitute us and surround us are primarily composed of void. Within this spatio-temporal domain, particles are treated as objects, while the energy field serves as the true subject. Interactions between the color fields of the agitated particles create an ever-revolving game of light that outlines ephemeral shapes, in the present, making them appear and dissolve.\n\nIn this space between geometry, organic forms, and fluid, rhythmic motion, we can perceive heartbeats, flowers, cosmic structures, and more, while meditating on the forces that make life a constant within the impermanence of matter.\n\n\nThis work is animated and can be resized and exported as a seamless looping GIF. As the density and dynamics of the particles depend on the display size, the aesthetics change with the size of the canvas.\n\n\nFeatures and Interaction\n- Pause & Menu Access: Click on the animated painting to open the menu. Click again on the painting to hide the menu and restart the animation.\n- Size: Define the frame size, then confirm by clicking OK to apply the change.\n- GIF Export: Save the current animation as a GIF.\n- Frame Navigation: Move between frames with the < X / Y > selector.\n- PNG Export: Save a snapshot of the current frame as a PNG.\n- Sync: Synchronize multiple screens using webRTC (highly experimental with challenging user experience; intended for the adventurous).\n\n\nEnergomorphy was created and developed by Nico in 2024 using a custom-crafted codebase that incorporates various open-source libraries:\n- Generic libraries (wgpu, winit, wasm-bindgen, etc.) for working with Rust in the browser and GPU.\n- Stefan Gustavson's psrdnoise WGSL implementation.\n- Matt DesLauriers's gifenc JS library for encoding GIFs.\n- Eli Grey's FileSaver JS library for downloading files.\n\nCopyright © 2024 Nicolas Arbogast\n(See the LICENSE file included for details and contact information.)",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",
