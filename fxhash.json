            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

            "description": "Can nature really be a gift if it isn't ours to give?\nDo we feel the need to bind it close in the ways of old to live?\nIf a gift was given would all be forgiven, a place of harmony now we can live in?\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nA gift of nature, sort of. As natural as a digital gift can be. It is a gen art token of my gratitude you might say. It is the younger sibling of \"The Spectrum of Nature\". \n\nThis is a gift from me to you, a gift of nature that pulls you through. \n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nTo know more about the concept and technicalities of this piece, see the fxtext article “The spectrum of nature - a short making of”. However, feel free to skip the article.\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nBasic info:\nThe initial render will be 1000px wide and 1000px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x2000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x9000 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n/*./*..\\*./*..\\*../*./*..\\*./*..\\*.\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

            "description": "It may appear as an indecipherable map to some. To others, it may present itself as a cross section of an underground cave. Or maybe an uncanny landscape of volcanic activity, a diagram of geological strata, or even something else entirely. Some vague structure may also appear; is it the remains of an ancient civilization? Or perhaps a glimpse into our own tomorrow?\n\nIn \"Agharta\", I sought to create a generative work that could invite the viewer to explore the depths of their imagination and uncover hidden structures within the seemingly chaotic composition. The idea came to me when I was exploring Simplex noise and pixel displacement in Cables. I was surprised by the emergent structures that appeared when some set of parameters paired with the right texture. \n\nThe title of the piece references the mythical underground world said to be located at the earth's core. This idea of hidden depths and secret worlds within the earth resonates with the abstract and enigmatic nature of the result generated by the noise. Imagery of landscape, vague structures, or geological features may appear but never stand out on its own; it exists in a state of constant flow and intersection as if viewed from another dimension. And just like the myth itself that bring up numerous theories that doesn’t necessarily connected to each other, it hints at that idea of an elusive imagined realm while never actually represent it completely.\n\n\n\n=========\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024px (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048px\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840px\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[Scroll/pinch] to zoom and drag to pan\n\n[r] or [zoom out to max] Reset position\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot of the current state at rendered resolution\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* This project use shaders that relies on GPU. Hi-res output may slow down your device. Since it also utilize GPU instance for thumbnail rendering, expect longer time for every iterations to be signed by fx(hash).\n\n* If 'glitching' occurs or the composition behaves differently at different resolution, just refresh the page to reset it (except for the thin lines, which are always drawn at approximately 1 pixel, so expect it to vary at different resolution).\n\nMade with cables.gl, a node-based webgl environment\n\nXALTED 2022",

But once every thousand years, it spreads its wings on a large pile of firewood and sings, and when it is excited by its song, it lights a fire with its beak, and by burning in the fire from its ashes, another phoenix is ​​born.\nIn many cultures, the phoenix is ​​considered a symbol of immortality, sacrifice and long life.\n\nIn this work, I tried to create bird-like shapes that are being formed and created by using a grid in the form of noise and with the shape of rectangles that have random length and width and get their color from the palettes. You can clearly see the wings or the bird's head in most of the exits\nIn fact, my idea is to depict the moment of resurrection and rebirth of the phoenix from the heart of the ashes, which rises to the sky.\nthe ash particles around this reborn bird are being scattered in the air and finally from At the heart of this re-creation, a beautiful and glorious phoenix comes into existence.\n\nMade by p5.js",

            "description": "This piece was started as a thing about evolution. \n\nI joined the generative art movement one year ago, so to celebrate it, I decided to take the code of the Tangentum and let it evolve into something new.\n\nI made several attempts, and all of them were unsuccessful. And the reason was not the code quality - it worked as it should, but the life ran out of it with every iteration. It looked rotten, like organic cells falling apart. At the same time, I was facing a period of existential crisis, so it took me even deeper into my dark emotions. My artwork was dying, like myself.\n\nBut then I realized that it’s a natural process. You meet the Idea, or the Muse, and it helps you give birth to an artwork, probably with pain. Then It lives its life, with or without you, and then it dies. You can do nothing with it, the only thing you can do is accept it. You can’t reuse the same idea to make art over and over again; someday, you have to let it go and give something new a chance.\n\nSo I finished this piece as a thing about acceptance of death, at least the death of Muses and Ideas.\n\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience. Chrome is highly recommended for high res saving.\n\nMade with love and p5js.\n\n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG at current resolution\n[2] - save PNG 6000  x  3372",

Different species evolve and interact together, resulting in stabilizing patterns out of their parametric configurations. A form of artificial life.\n\nThis work is based on the paper \"Characteristics of pattern formation and evolution in approximations of physarum transport networks\", written by Jeff Jones and popularized in the artistic field by Sage Jenson. Some features were added to increase the visual and behavioral complexity of the system. Agents are divided into different species, with their own set of rules and interacting with their own substrate. Substrates also interact with each other and agents will mutate in contact of some of them.\n\nNFT License\nRuns properly on Chrome 97.0.4692.99\nGPU intensive\n\nPress P to pause (double tab touch devices)\nPress",
