            "description": "\"In the year of 3023 the planet Earth from which all humans descend, today is called 'EARTH01', it is so called because it was the first planet to be completely destroyed by humanity. During the last few years of this planet's existence, the human race used all its resources to find new habitable planets and ways to reach them.\n\nAfter long years of tireless research, they began to discover new places where they could survive and explore, and thus they migrated from planet to planet and formed human colonies for thousands of years. Then one day some of them arrived on a new planet to begin their colonization, in this place they found trees very similar to the ones they knew, through ancient records of their ancestors, to have existed on EARTH01.\n\nBut unlike the trees on EARTH01, these were gigantic and instead of just fruit, some species also produced many types of important resources for human survival, such as water (extracted from some types of fruit), and even precious ores similar to of your home planet. To grow and survive, trees needed nothing more than a specific light from that solar system, which was very plentiful on that planet. These trees were then named 'Bellatrix', which in Latin (an almost lost language of EARTH01) meant 'warrior'.\n\nWith this discovery they thought had in their hands an infinite power, and so they began the same cycle done on all other planets, sucking all possible resources without thinking about the possibility of them having an end.\nAfter a few hundred years the planet began to crumble due to exploitation, and all the chaos caused by humans due to their greed and selfishness turned against them. Few Bellatrixes were left alive, the few existing rivers on the planet dried up, the woods and forests before full of life and those wonderful trees, no longer existed...\n\nSociety was in decline, laws no longer had effect on this civilization, there were groups of marauders, living there was no longer something safe. That planet full of life was now a desert planet, surrounded by sand dunes that swallowed the ruins of ancient buildings.\nIt was then that people realized that the same mistake had been made for all these thousands of years, generation after generation, no matter how fertile the new planet was, humanity always managed to deplete it and its resources. But it was too late, this civilization no longer had enough resources for them to leave this planet.\n\nWith that, a movement began for the preservation of these trees and the creation of complexes where people and Bellatrixes could live in safety, away from looters and other dangers now common in this place. The complexes were formed by units, which were raised many meters high to hinder the action of invaders, they were like small and large cities, but now far from the ground. These units were supported by small central columns, the more units and Bellatrixes in the complex, the more powerful and populous it was.\n\nAnd that's how they lived for many years, in these complexes there were rules and each one had their own specific ones, and they worked autonomously. Utilizing the resources obtained through the Bellatrixes and finally understanding their importance, they were able to keep the population alive and continue their civilization.\"\n\nThis is a record found in the diary of an unidentified space traveler and the only existing record of civilization on this planet.\n\n------------------------------------\nAbout the work:\nThis work was built entirely with code using only math, logic and 2D shapes to create light, shadow and perspective.\n\n------------------------------------\nFeatures:\n\"Palette\": 23 Palettes\n\"Units\": 1 > 45\n\"Bellatrixes\": 0 > 135\n\"Resource level\": Very Low, Low, Medium, High, Very High\n\"Population\": Very Small, Small, Medium, High, Very High\n\"Clouds\": True, False\n\"Sun/Moon\": Sun, Moon, False\n\n------------------------------------\nConstrols in live mode:\nOn desktop: Press 's' or 'S' to save as PNG (2534x3596)\nOn mobile: Touch the screen to save as PNG (2534x3596)\n\nArtwork created with p5.js and love.\nFebruary-March 2023",

Colorless spaces allow pure connections with forms and textures, revealing beauty in absence.\nBy emphasizing the concept of 'Lost Spaces,' this work delves into parts of our being that are usually overlooked. 'Lost Spaces' reminds us of the opportunities that lie within absence or imperfection. This canvas creates a space where emptiness is not seen as a lack but as an open realm for creativity, reflection, and new possibilities.

            "description": "Bored in Math Class is a project all about exploring grids. Using grids is common in generative art, and I wanted to see how far I could push this simple technique. I integrated an irregular square packing algorithm described by Gorilla Sun on one of his blog posts to give the compositions more variety rather than just having a uniform grid. I explored a bunch of different ideas and repurposed some old code to generate patterns inside each square. Many of the patterns can be layered on top of each other to make the composition even more interesting. I decided to call it \"Bored in Math Class\" because it has a playful feel and the grids remind me of graph paper that I would doodle on when I was bored [in math class of course].\n\nThere are 10 color palettes, 5 different types of grids, and 8 types of patterns (though they can be layered to create more).\n\nPress 'p' while on Live View to save a high quality (4000x4000) png of the canvas.\n\nCreated using p5.js\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC 4.0",

It combines the joy of interaction, digital color and minimalist sculpture with the potential of a long running, continuously unique visual. Based on “Shipping” from 2016, it is inspired by Anne Truitt, Ugo Rondinone, Imi Knoebel, Kelly Ellsworth and many others.\n\nA subdivision slices the viewport influenced by width, height and depth. Corners are cut by replacing them with two new points, pulled towards each other along the edges. Shapes are “rounded\" by repeating this step, keeping the new points close together. As colors change, so do the relations between shapes, even if geometry changes at a slower pace. New compositions are created on click or after a timeout. This progress over time allows for infinite iterations within the space of each token. It is the promise of a seeded starting point, plus the potential for unlimited new and unique iterations and states over time.",

            "description": "PixlFlippr is an offshoot of my \"Simple Harmonic Motion\" series, inspired by the complexity of life emerging through the interaction of simple 'dumb' behaviors, with intricate details emerging on multiple scales. PixlFlippr operates on a pixel level (in the form of a GLSL frag shader).\n\nEvery pixel oscillates at a single fixed frequency, slightly out-of-sync with its neighbors. There is no explicit pixel-neighborhood communication (as there would be in eg Cellular Automata), and every pixel acts autonomously, oblivious to its surroundings. Yet collectively, the entire system exhibits constantly evolving complex high level behavior on many scales, ranging from patterns & behaviors spanning a few pixels, all the way up to the level of the entire image. These are further amplified through the emergent pixel aliasing artefacts & moiré patterns. \n\nAlso, it's trippy af. \n\nPS All generative mints are a seamless loop with a loop duration ranging from a few minutes to over an hour. So stick around & watch it mutate!",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

It's free because it has some errors I couldn't fix in how the tiles line up with each other, plus it's not all that artistic in my opinion. But I still thought it was a cool project that some might enjoy. Using p5js.\n\nAvailable until March 19. Royalties shared 50% with the minter.\n\nAfter opening, press \"s\" for a large png.",

So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\n\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\nBecause this is an NFT in PFP format, you can put it on your avatar on Twitter or Instagram.",
