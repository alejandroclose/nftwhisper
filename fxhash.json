Colors blend skillfully, creating the illusion of light and shadow, yet allowing one to feel the chill of moonlight and the lingering warmth of the setting sun.\n\nThe artist seems to have observed the shaping and destruction of the world with a detached perspective. It is a piece of art that appears to be the result of prolonged contemplation, profound insights, and strength.",

            "description": "“Winesburg, Ohio” is an act of uncanny place-making. The collection borrows its name from a 1919 short-story cycle by Sherwood Anderson, which explores a peculiar cast of characters living within a fictionalized, midwestern town. Like Anderson’s text, the “Winesburg, Ohio” algorithm constructs a world through recurring portrayals of specific structures and landmarks. Its scenes are populated by a variety of familiar elements taken from my larger body of work, including water towers, houses, and churches. Meanwhile, a series of scripted gestures insert abstract compositional elements into the outputs, counteracting their pictorial legibility. The strange landscapes that result are composite ideograms, comprised of multiple spatial possibilities that co-exist in varying states of contradiction.",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself.

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.

            "description": "Komšije,' a word meaning 'neighbors' in Serbian, is an art piece that intertwines architectural elements with the Golden Ratio (1:1.618). Inspired by the brutalist architecture of New Belgrade, Serbia, and my love for minimalism and modernism, this work explores the possibilities of this combination generatively.\n\nThe buildings of New Belgrade, a significant inspiration for this piece, exhibit a unique character. Despite their aesthetic, which may have fallen out of popular style, these structures are exceptionally solid and well-designed, having withstood the test of time. More than mere apartment blocks, they represent vertical ecosystems. Within their stark and imposing concrete forms exist a multitude of private worlds, each suspended in a communal yet distinct space, embodying the essence of interconnectedness and resilience.\n\nThe Golden Ratio, a recurring element in my creations, is a proportion frequently found in nature. It is visible in sea shell spirals and human body proportions, offering an aesthetically pleasing and comforting familiarity.\n\nIn 'Komšije,' this ratio arranges mostly residential architectural forms in elevation view, blending Mid-Century modernism, Japanese post-modernism, and Eastern European brutalism. The compositions are created by repeatedly dividing the width and height of each piece by the Golden Ratio, ensuring every element is proportionally related to the whole. This method aligns column widths and floor heights, maintaining a cohesive structure.\n\nThe artwork strikes a balance between formal architectural diagrams and hand-drawn sketches. It features generative imperfections that mimic my sketching style, fostering a sense of openness and possibility missing from formal or detailed diagrams and renders. Although the structures depicted may not be architecturally practical, they are designed to evoke a sense of wonder and joy through their playful geometry and massing.\n\n—————\n\nTENDER x Studio Yorktown\nDecember 2023\n\n'Komšije’ is Serbian for ‘neighbors’, and is a generative art series created by Studio Yorktown in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n—————\n\nKey Commands : \n\nPress ‘S’ to save a high-resolution output of your structure.",

            "description": "This piece was started as a thing about evolution. \n\nI joined the generative art movement one year ago, so to celebrate it, I decided to take the code of the Tangentum and let it evolve into something new.\n\nI made several attempts, and all of them were unsuccessful. And the reason was not the code quality - it worked as it should, but the life ran out of it with every iteration. It looked rotten, like organic cells falling apart. At the same time, I was facing a period of existential crisis, so it took me even deeper into my dark emotions. My artwork was dying, like myself.\n\nBut then I realized that it’s a natural process. You meet the Idea, or the Muse, and it helps you give birth to an artwork, probably with pain. Then It lives its life, with or without you, and then it dies. You can do nothing with it, the only thing you can do is accept it. You can’t reuse the same idea to make art over and over again; someday, you have to let it go and give something new a chance.\n\nSo I finished this piece as a thing about acceptance of death, at least the death of Muses and Ideas.\n\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience. Chrome is highly recommended for high res saving.\n\nMade with love and p5js.\n\n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG at current resolution\n[2] - save PNG 6000  x  3372",

            "description": "An exploration of light transport and pathtracing in 2D.\n\nIn collaboration with TENDER.\n\nPress \"s\" to save a screenshot. Caustic Obstacles uses progressive monte carlo rendering, meaning that at first the image will appear noisy, but over time it will become smoother. It may take up to several minutes for the noise to become unnoticeable (or longer, if you specify a very high resolution). The piece is never officially \"done\" rendering, but instead becomes asymptotically smoother with time - take your screenshots whenever you feel it's smooth enough!\n\nUse the url \"width\" parameter to change the resolution of the piece, e.g. \"/?width=2160\". Every edition is rendered in a 5x7 aspect ratio, and the height will be determined automatically based on the width specified. This means that the height will be determined with the formula width * 7 / 5, rounded up. By default the width is 1080, which results in a height of 1512, while a width of, for example, 2160, would result in a height of 3024.\n\n\n\n–––––––\nTENDER x ella\nDecember 2023  \nCaustic Obstacles is a generative art series created by Ella Hoeppner in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n–––––––",

Intrigued by this challenge, I've delved deep into the pixels of this issue. 🙂\n\nDrawing inspiration from Rev Dan Catt’s 'Tally!' and applying similar principles of Cable Management, I've assembled a fun and free OE project.\n\nThis project dynamically evolves with each iteration.Grid is determined by a random value calculated as follows: the lower bound starts at 3 and increases incrementally with every 100 iterations, while the upper bound starts at 4 and increases with every 30 iterations. In practical terms, as the iteration count increases, both the minimum and maximum possible number of cols&rows gradually increase.\n\n3200x3200px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

Embracing a raw and unpolished aesthetic, these grids symbolize the often overlooked aspects of the creative process, underscoring the belief that creativity requires time, deep introspection, and persistent exploration. \nThis work emphasizes that every incomplete piece or unrealized idea is valuable, offers insight, and is an essential step in the evolution of digital artistry.\n\n///\\\\\\///\\\\\\///\n\n2023, Created with p5.js and chroma.js",
