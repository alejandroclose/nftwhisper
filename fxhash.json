This collection features a large number of generative quadrilaterals and a unique painting algorithm of tinting select overlapping sections, combining to produce a wide range of unique outputs that toe a visually pleasing line between order and chaos. Inspired by early computer art pioneers such as Georg Nees and Vera Molnár, the piece builds on their work exposing how even simplistic algorithms can lead to exciting and unexpected results.\n\n\n13 possible color schemes (some with random tint variations). Multiple draw modes.\nChances for extra jumbled shapes or other rare variants.\n\n\nKeyboard controls, make sure to click the window into focus to use:\n\nPress [1] to view at native size.\nPress [2] to view at large size.\nPress [0] to return to default view.\n\nPress [s] to download and save as PNG.",

However, the story goes that they had some disagreements, exact reason is unknown, but the legend is that Mondrian never accepted diagonals, while Theo insisted on their dynamic aspects.\n2. 1908: Voronoi studies the famous partition of n-dimensional spaces, now bearing his name by \"Voronoi diagrams\".\n3. 1915: Start of suprematism with Malevich's Black Square. This generative piece employs the craquelure from this painting, which also sometimes is used as a symbol of authenticity : )\n\nThe work is done with p5.js and p5.voronoi libraries.\nUsually it has the palette of Piet Mondrian, with jagged edges (as some kind of middle ground between him and Theo); but rare cases include straight lines, and also color palettes from several of Van Doesburg artworks.",

The problem is it will toggle others.\n- Press and hold the mouse button to slightly move the viewpoint. The previous interaction not being disabled while doing that, you get some switching all over the place as a bonus bug/feature.\n\n- Press \"a\" to increase quality of the antialiasing (3 levels), at the cost of performances.

            "description": "Real time animation (WebGL)\nVariable dimension\n2022\n\nNazca is a group of living glyphs made in the soil of the GPU. There are 17 figures that get combined and mixed over three layers. The figures vary in complexity but are generally created with vertical and horizontal lines only. Figures have at least one seed, some even have a seed per path. A seed is an oscillating pixel that can be compared to a square wave oscillator of audio synthesis and is usually followed by a path or a set of paths. The purpose of the paths is to send the pixels along the lines to make the figures visible through movement and to create a reduction to pure animation.\n\n👽 Kim Asendorf",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
