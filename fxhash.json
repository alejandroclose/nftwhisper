            "description": "\nAt the heart of \"Sketch Block\" is the concept of the sketch block itself - a blank canvas where the possibilities for creation are endless. The name \"Sketch Block\" reflects the process of creation that inspired the token's design. Like an artist's sketchbook, the token captures the playful experimentation and exploration that underlies the creative process.\n\nThe hand-drawn style gives a playful feel to the project, with each shape looking as if it was quickly drawn onto the canvas. Along with the use of vibrant color palettes with tones ranging from soft pastels to bold and bright tones, the projects can produce a wide range of different results.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Controls:\n\n- Press 'h' to save the image",

Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px).

Through this artwork, I attempt to visually represent the complex and often overwhelming emotions that I experience on a daily basis. It is a reflection of the cyclical nature of my thoughts and feelings, and the ways in which I try to make sense of them. But as I delve deeper into my own personal experiences, I realize that in the end, internal chaos should not be controlled, but accepted.\n\nThis artwork is my most personal, as it reflects my innermost sensations. It is a reminder to myself and to others that it is okay to not have everything under control, and that it is important to allow the uncertainty and unpredictability of life. I hope that it will resonate with others and provide a sense of connection and understanding. It is a reminder that we are not alone in our struggles and that it is important to embrace our own imperfections.\n\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.

This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px). It may last for high numbers.\nWe recommend the use of Chrome browser in order to render properly the texture.\n\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 × 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.net",

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px). It may last for high numbers.\nWe recommend the use of Chrome browser in order to render properly the texture.\n\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 × 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.net",

            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "\"Aerial\" is a generative (100% code) abstract artwork, emphasizing to texturing and painting surface aging wear, inspired by surfaces with erosion - corrosion, craquelure (cracks), scratches, etc for example old drying oil or tempera painting in materials like canvas, wall, stone or wood. \n\nThe abstract shapes in many cases resemble like aerial eye view formations which gave and the name to this collection.\n\nThe input for each iteration is some simple geometry (boxes) i \"draw\" in a WebGL canvas, using for variation perlin noise values. Then manipulate the pixels and perform color mapping (color values from my palettes) inside a GLSL shader. \n\n\"Aerial\" includes 49 palettes (with several colors each) that have been stored externally (in the application folder) as Adobe \".act\" color table files so that avoiding hard coding (including all palettes in the code) consuming in this way resources eg. memory from user's system. I just load only the one palette i am going to use\n\nAll are 100% code, no images used.\n\nCONTROLS\n\nKEYS:\n\n- 1-3: Set resolution from 1x to 3x of the current dimension (possibly slower performance in higher values)\n- T: switch texture on/off\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait (default) with aspect ratio 0.85\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ when switching orientations or resizing\n\n----\nMade with p5js and custom shaders\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\nWant to know more ? please read the \"SHORT BIO\" section here in \"Emotions\" collection: https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/22243\n\n© Feb. 2023  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

            "description": "Toccata is a piece about decay, about the impermanent. The emergence over time or, rather, progression of entropy is a key characteristic of our universe. Everything evolves to nothing. We as mortal beings have sometimes trouble reconciling with this idea. Humans have sought immortality for millennia, be it through ancient potions or modern medicine, be it from leaving a legacy that we feel will stand the test of time. It will, only to decay later than us.\n\nToccata is a piece about change. Change lies at the heart of human cognition and human nature. Our thoughts and our emotions happen over time, and are a function of the change that is both around us and at the very core of our selves. Change comes in nature in cycles. Seasons of growth, seasons of ripe fruits of life, seasons of decay, of death, rebirth.\n\nToccata is music. We find music to convey some of the deepest streams of human condition, connecting it to some other form of being. Music also happens over time, and music happens because of change. Music encodes our feelings better than any other aid we may have. Toccata incorporates this at its very core, as the main sound is Andreas' family piano where he learned to play, sampled this past July.\n\nRead more about the piece, and the collaboration between Marcelo and Andreas on andreasrau.eu/toccata\n\n---\n\nBasic controls:\n- Click on the piece or press spacebar to start it (WebAudio requires user intervention for the music to start). Once the music has started, again click or press spacebar to play/pause.\n- Press “s” to save a still at the current resolution\n- Press “r” to start recording a video at the current resolution, then “r” again to stop.\n\n---\n\nWebM audio-video recording performed using the library RecordRTC by https://muazkhan.com/, MIT licence.",

Like an artist's sketchbook, the token captures the playful experimentation and exploration that underlies the creative process.\n\nThe hand-drawn style gives a playful feel to the project, with each shape looking as if it was quickly drawn onto the canvas. Along with the use of vibrant color palettes with tones ranging from soft pastels to bold and bright tones, the projects can produce a wide range of different results.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUser Controls:\n\n- Press 'h' to save the image",
