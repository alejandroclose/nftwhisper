            "description": "Flexagons are foldable paper toys that have an amazing ability to change their appearance and reveal hidden faces when flexed. They are a fun puzzle to play with but also help to remind me that life is always changing and there are incredible surprises ahead.\n\nThis generative series explores designs for my favorite kind of flexagon, the octaflexagon. Each flexagon is arranged to show all four sides simultaneously and rendered using an ink and paper technique. The result can be exported as an svg to plot and fold into a physical flexagon.\n\nThe algorithm works by layering concentric shapes over warped space with a special culling system that feeds back into the design. The palette is also generated dynamically using up to four ink colors and a paper color. It is all custom coded in vanilla JS for this very unique and important purpose of being able to plot flexagons and promote flexagon awareness.\n\nUp to 25 of the holders will be chosen to receive a free physical version of their flexagon, plotted and folded by me. For a chance to receive one, please tweet the image of your mint and tag me @KilledByAPixel or email me directly if you prefer.\n\nControls\n\n1 - Show the inverted design for this flexagon.\n2 - Save a svg template, front and back files sized to fit A3 (11x17) paper.\n3 - Save a svg of the flexagon design arranged to show all 4 faces.\n4 - Save a svg with a custom paper width, margins are automatically included.\n5 - Save a svg with 5 random flexagons on one page, all using the same colors.\n\nConstruction Notes\n\nOctaflexagons are easy to make once you get the hang of it but can be tricky at first. My template includes a thin cut margin along the top and bottom that is necessary to give some wiggle room for the paper to fold over itself without becoming too tight. If you are not using 17 inch wide paper, use the built in function to adjust the paper size automatically.\n\n1. Designs include a front and back svg that fits 11x17 paper.\n2. Plot the front and back svg so they line up on opposite sides.\n3. Use the same colors for the same layers on both sides.\n4. When cutting and folding, focus on the front side.\n5. Fold back and forth along each crease, try to keep it balanced.\n6. The final fold flips around the back, similar to a hexaflexagon.\n7. When folded correctly the two blank triangles should match up.\n8. Use glue on the blank triangle where the logo is to attach them together.\n\nCode and Outputs are Copyright (C) 2023 Frank Force\nArtwork is released under CC BY-NC 4.0",

Inspired, I embarked on a creative journey, aiming to forge a fresh perspective. Through my project, I aimed to reimagine nature using simple shapes – rectangles, circles, and triangles. These foundational forms breathed life into landscapes, while also giving birth to monoliths within the collection. These towering structures became a bridge, uniting the essence of nature with the sleek lines of modernity. Through this union of forms, I aimed to highlight the captivating interplay between contrasting worlds, showcasing the intriguing harmony that emerges from their coexistence.\n\n\nPlease press ‘2’ to ‘7’ to change the resolution (max 5600 × 7000 px).\nUse the key ‘S’ to save the output as a PNG file.

The artwork I've crafted presents a cityscape like no other, where transparent buildings and towering skyscrapers dominate the scene.\n\nWhat truly sets this piece apart is the central element: a radiant sun, but not in the conventional sense. Instead, this sun is represented by a vigilant iris, symbolizing the omnipresent watchfulness that modern technology has injected into our lives. It's a striking visual metaphor for the constant surveillance we're subjected to, much like what Alan Parsons Project envisioned over four decades ago in their timeless masterpiece.\n\nIn the words of the song's haunting chorus, 'I am the eye in the sky looking at you, I can read your mind,' my generative art project encapsulates the eerie and thought-provoking essence of constant observation, inviting viewers to confront the ever-watchful eye that hovers over our lives.\n\n-\tHit s for svg export\n-\tHit p for png export (could take a little longer)\n\nParams for palette, form factor, mode and composition seed ",

Samuel's hands were weathered from years of meticulously shaping stones into sturdy structures. His reputation as the village's finest mason was well-deserved, for every building he touched seemed to possess a touch of magic. One sunny morning, the village elders approached Samuel with a special request. They sought to erect a grand wall in the village square, a symbol of unity and prosperity. Samuel gladly accepted the challenge, and over the course of many months, he worked tirelessly, selecting the perfect stones, carving intricate designs, and patiently assembling the wall piece by piece.\n\nAs the day of the wall's unveiling arrived, the entire village gathered in anticipation. Samuel had indeed worked a masterpiece. The villagers marvelled at the wall's beauty and craftsmanship, and they knew that it would stand for generations, a testament to Samuel's unparalleled skill and the enduring power of masonry to transform raw stone into timeless works of art and utility.

Samuel's hands were weathered from years of meticulously shaping stones into sturdy structures. His reputation as the village's finest mason was well-deserved, for every building he touched seemed to possess a touch of magic. One sunny morning, the village elders approached Samuel with a special request. They sought to erect a grand wall in the village square, a symbol of unity and prosperity. Samuel gladly accepted the challenge, and over the course of many months, he worked tirelessly, selecting the perfect stones, carving intricate designs, and patiently assembling the wall piece by piece.\n\nAs the day of the wall's unveiling arrived, the entire village gathered in anticipation. Samuel had indeed worked a masterpiece. The villagers marvelled at the wall's beauty and craftsmanship, and they knew that it would stand for generations, a testament to Samuel's unparalleled skill and the enduring power of masonry to transform raw stone into timeless works of art and utility. Samuel's legacy as the village's master mason was secured, and his story would be told and retold, passing on the art of masonry to the next generation.\n\n_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|_\n___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___\n\n[h] generate high res version\n[s] save image\n\n_|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|_\n___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___|___",

In a way it is a continuation of my previous works \"Contraformas\" and \"Similarity\".\n\nThe principle of emergence can occur through the combination of the following factors: number of paths, movement pattern of the walker, the separation of the paths from each other, the length and minimum of each path, the frequency with which these variables change, the position of the camera in the z axis, the decrease in the size of the boxes, whether or not the boxes have borders, the size of the borders, the color of the palette, the range of variation of the color, the distance of the lights for each box, and some other rules.\n\n3 available aspect ratios\n2400 pixels high\nMore than 40 color palettes\n3 canvas color styles\n2 styles of boxes\n\nPress \"S\" to save a png image\nPress \"T\" to save a tiff image (may take time, canvastotiff.js)\n\ncreated by @mdollinger using p5js",
