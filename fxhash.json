Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey! \n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you‚Äôve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n‚Äî\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n‚Äî\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n‚Ä¢ https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n‚Äî\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others‚Äô skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci √† tous!

            "description": "An experiment in line texture by Nate Donato, this piece features lines composed of a sand-like particle texture.  Bounds around line generation properties were set loosely, resulting in many possible line characters with unique weights, wobbles, and more.  Lines are generated in individual layered segments one by one, resulting in a pleasing animation of gradual composition as they compose one of twelve possible shapes, in one of eight possible color schemes.  \n\nEach \"line\" is made up of thousands of points, and so rendering the live view of this piece may be computer intensive.  As an added bonus a small amount of proprietary line data is emitted to the development console, allowing the minted collection to serve as a palette of potential line qualities for the artist to use in future works.  Any owners of pieces used in this way by the artist on future projects will be granted a share of said future project's royalties.\n\nIn active live view, press [1] to view medium res, [2] to view high res, and [0] to return to original viewport width view.\n\nWritten in vanilla JavaScript without the use of external libraries.",

            "description": "The first blueprint was found in 1947 on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.\nIt has been studied several times.\nNumerous theories arose trying to explain its origin.\nNone of them was decided conclusively.\n\nOne year ago, a rare group of waves coming from space was intercepted on earth.\nThis happened during the 2021 summer.\nIt was unclear if they were born from natural events.\nDying stars, black holes... Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n‚Äî--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n‚Äî--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n‚Äî--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022.

            "description": "This is the second in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nThis work is a mark of progress. Christopher Scussel and I are working on modernizing MINI-EXPLOR. Chris is working on updating the engine from the original FORTRAN code of the 1970‚Äôs and its other limitations to usable JavaScript. In concert, I am analyzing and synthesizing the capabilities of the code and identifying an aesthetic. Together we continue to update EXPLOR and add new features.\n\nCPoSOP Composition is an original derivative work of Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids that was one of Knowlton‚Äôs original test examples. (Example 3)\n\nThe original EXPLOR picture frame was limited to a fixed array of 140 x 140 ‚Äúcharacters.‚Äù Chris has rewritten the code to make the picture space variable. In this piece I increased the image space to a resolution 250 x 250  picture cells. Each picture cell is a 3x3 pixel block. \n\nThe EXPLOR functions are designed to interact with the current contents of each cell in the picture array. Every EXPLOR function has a rules parameter. In this test I‚Äôve added a background. Thus when I draw my modified CPoSOP widget over the background it interacts with the color contents of a background cell or, the color of the cell based on a previously drawn widget.\n\nI‚Äôve modified the original CPoSOP code and replaced constants with random variables. (made it a Spatial Force). I create a regular grid (Form of Spatial Organization) of a random size and draw the CPoSOP widget 85% of the time in one of the grid elements positions. The grid provides a structure to the image and the CPoSOP widget provides visual interest. The interaction of the widgets with the background and each other are amazing. \n\nIn keeping true to an EXPLOR vibe we use 4 color palettes. We let the computer randomly pick from three predefined palettes: Black and white. Four colors randomly chosen from set of 8 ‚ÄúBauhaus‚Äù colors. And, four truly random colors.\n\nWe continue to honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT series. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored now updated by Scussel and Kolomyjec. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history with a modern twist.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "The first blueprint was found in 1947 on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.\nIt has been studied several times.\nNumerous theories arose trying to explain its origin.\nNone of them was decided conclusively.\n\nOne year ago, a rare group of waves coming from space was intercepted on earth.\nThis happened during the 2021 summer.\nIt was unclear if they were born from natural events.\nDying stars, black holes... Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n‚Äî--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n‚Äî--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n‚Äî--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022.

            "description": "This is the second in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nThis work is a mark of progress. Christopher Scussel and I are working on modernizing MINI-EXPLOR. Chris is working on updating the engine from the original FORTRAN code of the 1970‚Äôs and its other limitations to usable JavaScript. In concert, I am analyzing and synthesizing the capabilities of the code and identifying an aesthetic. Together we continue to update EXPLOR and add new features.\n\nCPoSOP Composition is an original derivative work of Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids that was one of Knowlton‚Äôs original test examples. (Example 3)\n\nThe original EXPLOR picture frame was limited to a fixed array of 140 x 140 ‚Äúcharacters.‚Äù Chris has rewritten the code to make the picture space variable. In this piece I increased the image space to a resolution 250 x 250  picture cells. Each picture cell is a 3x3 pixel block. \n\nThe EXPLOR functions are designed to interact with the current contents of each cell in the picture array. Every EXPLOR function has a rules parameter. In this test I‚Äôve added a background. Thus when I draw my modified CPoSOP widget over the background it interacts with the color contents of a background cell or, the color of the cell based on a previously drawn widget.\n\nI‚Äôve modified the original CPoSOP code and replaced constants with random variables. (made it a Spatial Force). I create a regular grid (Form of Spatial Organization) of a random size and draw the CPoSOP widget 85% of the time in one of the grid elements positions. The grid provides a structure to the image and the CPoSOP widget provides visual interest. The interaction of the widgets with the background and each other are amazing. \n\nIn keeping true to an EXPLOR vibe we use 4 color palettes. We let the computer randomly pick from three predefined palettes: Black and white. Four colors randomly chosen from set of 8 ‚ÄúBauhaus‚Äù colors. And, four truly random colors.\n\nWe continue to honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT series. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored now updated by Scussel and Kolomyjec. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history with a modern twist.\n\nDr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Decadence should not be misunderstood. Over time, the word has had various meanings (political and cultural) but has also been associated with Symbolism and Aestheticism.\n\nThe contemporary definition of decadence emerged in the late 19th century and praised artifice over nature, sophistication over simplicity, at the same time defying contemporary discourse of decline by embracing subjects and styles that critics considered over-refined. \n\nNowadays, decadence also refers to stagnation and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of material prosperity and technological development which leads to an excessive indulgence in pleasure or luxury.\n\nIn this context, Decadence is a reflection on the collaboration between Jerome Herr and David Mrugala (thedotisblack). A collaboration that started several months ago with a simple grid of random values, that soon became an experiment of creativity, always in the search of expectations, interest in excessive indulgence of visual pleasure, a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged in a series of generative images with an aesthetics that values excess ‚Äì That is Decadence.\n\n- press 's' to save a standard image\n- press 'h' to save a high resolution image\n\nJerome Herr\n\nJerome Herr is from Luxembourg. Since 2015 he has created generative art with a passion for design and visual explorations. He is an active member of the creative coding community and a successful NFT artist, both on Teia and Fxhash.\n\nDavid Mrugala\n\nDavid is a German architect and intermedia artist, who lives in South Korea. He is the founder of thedotisblack, a platform and an archive for research design on (generative) drawings and animations made with code.",

            "description": "Snell's artifacts are imaginary geometric objects created using Snell's and Descartes' laws of optics that define the behavior of a ray of light passing from one transparent medium to another.\n\nBy applying these laws to extreme parameters, beyond what the real world is capable of producing and with a high level of variability, we open the door to a new world.\n\nIn order to keep some control over this extreme and crazy world, the grid within which the rays evolve is divided into several squares. Each of these squares limits the grid settings at that location.\n\nIn order to be able to generate a Snell Artifact, 1 to 6 million rays are created. It may take a while. So be patient while these radii are calculated.\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard commands:\n[S]: Saves a PNG image of 4000x4000 pixels without glow filter\n[SHIFT + S]: Saves a 4000x4000 pixel PNG image and applies a glow filter (may take a long time depending on your system)\n\nURL parameters:\nAdd the parameter size=N to generate an image of NxN pixels (glow effect will be disabled by default)\nAdd the parameter glow=true to apply a glow effect to the image\n\n\n\n\nArtist: Estienne\nJuly 2022",
