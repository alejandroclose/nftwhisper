            "description": "640 unique sketches of imaginary walls, inspired by the work of Norwegian architect Erling Viksjø (1910–1971) and his artist collaborators. Viksjø designed the Government Quarter in Oslo and invited artists from different disciplines to help design the facades and interiors of the buildings.\n\nViksjø’s aim was to “soften” modernist architecture. He invented «Natural Concrete», a type of concrete that deliberately exposes the mixed-in stones on its surface to give it warmth and a human touch. In my work, I have similar ambitions—using code instead of concrete.\n\nThe different styles of the piece are inspired by, and dedicated to some of the artists who worked together with Viksjø: Jakob Weidemann (~2%), Carl Nesjar (~18%), Odd Tandberg (~30%), and Tore Haaland (~50%).\n\nIn live mode, press ‘S’ to save an image at current resolution or ‘P’ to save a high-resolution file at 6000×6000px (this might take a while depending on your hardware).\n\nOriginal artwork by Andreas Rau · Made with p5.js & glsl · Oslo, 2021",

This is a \"plot loop\". The physical piece is displayed as aesthetics 4x2 grid of the frames. The animation is meant to be run at 16 FPS speed.\n\nYou can enjoy the digital version that simulates ink effects. But also, thanks to the utility token decoupling, get a physical one: the digital NFT is the recipe to a plottable art piece, owning it confers the right to plot or request a physical plot from @greweb (https://greweb.me/plots/nft). @greweb would use fountain pens but other plotting artists are free to achieve it with their materials and ship to collectors – as long as NFT is owned at request time.\n\nExample: https://greweb.me/plots/543\n\n@greweb – 2022 – tech: WebGL + Rust + WASM – CC BY-SA 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/\n",

            "description": "There’s so much more to our world than what we are able to perceive, let alone understand. Will we ever be able to even fully understand ourselves?\n\n–\n\nElevation is a series of 320 generative elevation drawings of imaginary structures. It is a reminder of the limits of our consciousness, and an ode to the manifold nuances that lie beyond what we can perceive, beyond what we even can imagine.\n\nAs a generative artist, I aim to elevate my own consciousness with the help of the machine. I welcome algorithms and randomness into the creation of my works, taking full control, and intentionally giving it away, always seeking to expand my imagination. For as humans alone, we remain limited to our own edifice of thought, and often fail to free ourselves from the visible, mundane world.\n\nBoth are present in Elevation: the visible and the imaginary, the mundane and the transcendent, the solid and the fragile. Where an architect’s elevation drawing marks the transition from the thought world into the visible world, Elevation remains in-between, depicting both the idea of an imaginary structure, and the structure itself.\n\n–\n\nElevation is intended for print. All holders of an Elevation NFT will be able to order the corresponding signed print in the respective paper format via andreasrau.eu/elevation. Press [s] to save the image as displayed or [p] to generate a print-ready PNG image at 300 dpi. This might take a while, depending on paper format and your hardware.\n\n–\n\nElevation\np5.js, glsl, html, css\nAndreas Rau, 2022",
