            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

            "description": "\"Re.flex.ions\" consists of hundreds of points distributed in space. Their positions are determined by two space-filling Sierpiński curves discovered by Wacław Sierpiński, a Polish mathematician of the late 19th and 20th centuries, who referred to himself as an \"explorer of infinity\".\n\nCountless points of light form cascades of reflections, imparting an otherworldly quality to the image. The richness of colors, a defining element of this artwork, plays a vital role, ranging from vibrant, intense hues to subtle pastels, creating a spectacular mosaic of colors. This explosion of colors gives the work energy and dynamism, attracting the eye and stimulating the senses.\n\nDensely arranged lights move along predetermined paths, enveloping the viewer in a visual experience that beckons contemplation of immersion within ethereal spaces. \"Re.flex.ions\" evokes an introspective atmosphere, encouraging exploration of emotions and a physical connection with the abstract image.\n\nAbstract art generates images and associations that rely on subtle reference points, such as contextual relationships, object interactions, and physical scale. Project responsiveness serves as a foundation for establishing these reference points. The resulting images recall both cosmic and microscopic visions. They are organic on one hand and mechanical in their movement on the other.\n\nThe perception of \"re.flex.ions\" varies depending on the device. Factors such as the image's context, size, and relationship to our physical body influence the interpretation. Smaller devices often evoke micro-scale associations, while larger screens transport observers into an indeterminate cosmic abyss. When projected onto traditional CRT monitors, the artwork assumes the aura of a laboratory experiment observed from a safe distance, as if through glass or the lens of an operator's camera. Immersion replaces mere spectatorship, fostering an experiential engagement.\n\nIn reference to responsiveness, \"re.flex.ions\" adapts to the aspect ratio of the display, but also enables interaction based on the position of a mobile device. The device's placement and movement in our hand add an additional layer, enhancing immersion and emphasizing the image's universal character.\n\nTo discover the full potential of \"re.flex.ions,\" watch it on various screens with different orientations and aspect ratios.\n\nInteractions:\n[v] – start/stop video recording (red dot appears in top right corner)\n[mobile devices] – device movement affects the image\n\n⎻ ⎻ ⎻\nPart of Responsive Dreams Live Minting Experience – 14/15 June 2023 – Nau Bostik, Barcelona\nMore info: responsivedreams.com\n⎻ ⎻ ⎻\nVideo recording performed using the library mp4-muxer by Vanilagy https://github.com/Vanilagy, MIT licence.",

            "description": "CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG is an homage to Ohne Titel (1969–1970) by Verena Loewensberg.\n\n2 of 5 in CENTURY-XXX, Series 2\nEdition of 128\n\nCENTURY-XXX is a series of software sketches that pay tribute to artists of the 20th century. Each piece is named after a specific artist and reimagines one of their original works through code, often by adding motion, variation, or interactive elements. These sketches don’t replicate the original artworks but instead extend their core ideas into new forms.\n\nBy “software sketch,” I mean something more informal than a finished artwork. While some of my projects take months or even years to complete, these sketches are created quickly—often in just a few days. They may be lighter in process, but they’re equally important to me. Sketching with code is how I think through ideas and discover new directions for future work.\n\nThe project began with the CENTURY exhibition at DAM Projects in Berlin in fall 2012, where I premiered Network C, Network D, and the first Signal to Noise software piece. Since then, these sketches have inspired more full-scale artworks like METASOTO, METAVASARELY, METAMOLNAR (also known as Hommage à Molnar), including the eponymous CENTURY released through Art Blocks in June 2021.\n\nCENTURY-XXX Series 1 was released from December 2021 to January 2022 in editions of 1,000. The first artwork in Series 2 followed in October 2022, also in an edition of 1,000. The remaining four works in Series 2 are scheduled for release starting in 2025, each in smaller editions of fewer than 128 based on what feels appropriate for the individual piece.\n\nThe long-term vision for CENTURY-XXX is to create 100 software sketches, each one inspired by a different artist and artwork from the 20th century.\n\nSERIES 1\n1.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMETAMALEVICH\n1.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMOLNAR(S)\n1.3 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMORELLET\n1.4 — CENTURY-XXX-METARILEY\n1.5 — CENTURY-XXX-METAKELLY\n\nSERIES 2\n2.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE\n2.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG\n\nMore CENTURY-XXX’s to come…",

Sometimes, you may need to look hard depending on the various atoms. \n\n* 's' - save an image of the current state \n* 'a' - activate atoms\n\nThe piece is to be experienced by default at 1000x1000, however, have fun with the image.

            "description": "CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG is an homage to Ohne Titel (1969–1970) by Verena Loewensberg.\n\n2 of 5 in CENTURY-XXX, Series 2\nEdition of 128\n\nCENTURY-XXX is a series of software sketches that pay tribute to artists of the 20th century. Each piece is named after a specific artist and reimagines one of their original works through code, often by adding motion, variation, or interactive elements. These sketches don’t replicate the original artworks but instead extend their core ideas into new forms.\n\nBy “software sketch,” I mean something more informal than a finished artwork. While some of my projects take months or even years to complete, these sketches are created quickly—often in just a few days. They may be lighter in process, but they’re equally important to me. Sketching with code is how I think through ideas and discover new directions for future work.\n\nThe project began with the CENTURY exhibition at DAM Projects in Berlin in fall 2012, where I premiered Network C, Network D, and the first Signal to Noise software piece. Since then, these sketches have inspired more full-scale artworks like METASOTO, METAVASARELY, METAMOLNAR (also known as Hommage à Molnar), including the eponymous CENTURY released through Art Blocks in June 2021.\n\nCENTURY-XXX Series 1 was released from December 2021 to January 2022 in editions of 1,000. The first artwork in Series 2 followed in October 2022, also in an edition of 1,000. The remaining four works in Series 2 are scheduled for release starting in 2025, each in smaller editions of fewer than 128 based on what feels appropriate for the individual piece.\n\nThe long-term vision for CENTURY-XXX is to create 100 software sketches, each one inspired by a different artist and artwork from the 20th century.\n\nSERIES 1\n1.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMETAMALEVICH\n1.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMOLNAR(S)\n1.3 — CENTURY-XXX-METAMORELLET\n1.4 — CENTURY-XXX-METARILEY\n1.5 — CENTURY-XXX-METAKELLY\n\nSERIES 2\n2.1 — CENTURY-XXX-METAFRANKE\n2.2 — CENTURY-XXX-METALOEWENSBERG\n\nMore CENTURY-XXX’s to come…",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",
