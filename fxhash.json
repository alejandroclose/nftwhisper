            "description": "Stippling clouds imagined by a computer.\n\nEach cloud is a \"Nuage possible\"\n\nIt may be generated from code,\nbut these clouds might have existed,\nor might exist in the future,\njust for a brief moment.\n\n\nThose images were inspired by Joanie Lemercier’s cloud series, an algorithm is imagining more and more variations of those skyscapes in an infinite quest for the perfect cloud.\n\nOnce created from code, the drawings are made by a plotter machine, a little robot that moves a pen over black paper to lay down dots of white ink. The robot is like an extension of the artist’s arm, allowing him to create infinite iterations and variations.\n\nThe dots pattern and their density help create the illusion of shadows, gradients and brightness, a technique inherited from the pointillism movement, born in Belgium and France in the late 19th century.\n",

            "description": "In a world of endless possibilities, I once stood as a complete beginner, with almost no knowledge of coding or p5js. But fueled by curiosity and determination, I dared to explore this unknown realm, eager to discover the secrets behind the screens. Little did I know that this bold step would transform me into an art alchemist, crafting captivating generative masterpieces that would enchant hearts and ignite imaginations.\n\nWith an adventurous spirit, I embraced the challenge of learning p5js, even though it felt overwhelming at first. Every line of code I wrote was like adding a stroke of paint to a blank canvas. Slowly, my confidence grew, and I was able to create my very first quadrilateral, a simple yet empowering achievement that marked the beginning of my artistic journey.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the world of coding, I discovered the beauty of shapes and lines, each forming a unique melody on the digital canvas. Combining quadrilaterals, I crafted captivating patterns that spoke to the soul, drawing viewers into my art with a magnetic pull.\n\nBeyond shapes, I ventured into crafting backgrounds that breathed life into my creations. Each background became a portal to different worlds, stirring emotions and sparking imaginations. With colors that danced like dreams, my art took on a life of its own, leaving a lasting impression on those who gazed upon it.\n\nTo all fellow art enthusiasts, I extend a heartfelt invitation to explore my generative art collection. Each piece is a testament to the power of perseverance and passion. Just as I grew from a beginner into an art alchemist, I hope my creations find a special place in your heart and home, evoking emotions and sparking your creativity.",

            "description": "Title: Urban trajectories\n\nit's a generative work that combines the precision and rigidity of a technical project with the expressiveness and creativity of informal abstract art. Made on graph paper highlighting the technical nature of the basic design. The grid creates mathematical order and clear structure, providing a stable foundation for artistic exploration.\n\nWithin some of the squares, the shapes intertwine and overlap, giving life to the geometric vision. Triangles stand out in different directions, some dotted with circles of various diameters, while rectangles of different sizes make up intriguing compositions. The colors used are black/white and a random colour, which catch the eye and create a lively contrast.\n\nthe work challenges the viewer to perceive art even in fields usually related to mathematics and engineering. The work invites reflection on the nature of order and creativity, showing how structure and artistic freedom can coexist in harmony. the work celebrates the beauty of geometric shapes and their versatility, demonstrating that even a technical foundation can be the starting point for a unique aesthetic experience.\n\n100% code - p5.js\n\nPress left mouse button to choose density from 1 to 15 (9000x12000) (wrong results set to 1)\n\nKenzo da barra",

Made on graph paper highlighting the technical nature of the basic design. The grid creates mathematical order and clear structure, providing a stable foundation for artistic exploration.\n\nWithin some of the squares, the shapes intertwine and overlap, giving life to the geometric vision. Triangles stand out in different directions, some dotted with circles of various diameters, while rectangles of different sizes make up intriguing compositions. The colors used are black/white and a random colour, which catch the eye and create a lively contrast.\n\nthe work challenges the viewer to perceive art even in fields usually related to mathematics and engineering. The work invites reflection on the nature of order and creativity, showing how structure and artistic freedom can coexist in harmony. the work celebrates the beauty of geometric shapes and their versatility, demonstrating that even a technical foundation can be the starting point for a unique aesthetic experience.\n\n100% code - p5.js\n\nPress left mouse button to choose density from 1 to 15 (9000x12000) (wrong results set to 1)\n\nKenzo da barra",

            "description": "Design and Form, a fundamental course at the Bauhaus, played a pivotal role in shaping the renowned art school's unique approach to design education. Founded in 1919 by architect Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus sought to bridge the gap between art and industry, promoting the idea that design should be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The Design and Form course served as a cornerstone of this philosophy, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and techniques that underpin all forms of visual expression.\n\nAt the heart of the Design and Form course was the exploration of the fundamental elements of design, such as line, shape, color, and texture. Students were encouraged to experiment with these elements through hands-on exercises, engaging in a process of discovery and self-expression. The course emphasized the importance of developing a keen sense of observation and a deep understanding of materials, enabling students to create harmonious compositions that seamlessly blended form and function.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of the Design and Form course was its interdisciplinary nature. The Bauhaus believed that design should transcend traditional boundaries, and students from various disciplines, including painting, sculpture, architecture, and crafts, came together to learn and collaborate. This interdisciplinary approach fostered a rich exchange of ideas, inspiring students to push the boundaries of their respective fields and embrace new ways of thinking. The Design and Form course at the Bauhaus laid the foundation for the school's revolutionary approach to design education, leaving an indelible mark on the world of art and design.\n\n-\tHit s for svg export\n-\tHit p for png export\n\nParams for palette, form factor, mode and composition seed.",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens —created in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco— that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking “what if” questions such as “What if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?” Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road —one direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature— it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario’s thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",

(...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

            "description": "In a world of endless possibilities, I once stood as a complete beginner, with almost no knowledge of coding or p5js. But fueled by curiosity and determination, I dared to explore this unknown realm, eager to discover the secrets behind the screens. Little did I know that this bold step would transform me into an art alchemist, crafting captivating generative masterpieces that would enchant hearts and ignite imaginations.\n\nWith an adventurous spirit, I embraced the challenge of learning p5js, even though it felt overwhelming at first. Every line of code I wrote was like adding a stroke of paint to a blank canvas. Slowly, my confidence grew, and I was able to create my very first quadrilateral, a simple yet empowering achievement that marked the beginning of my artistic journey.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the world of coding, I discovered the beauty of shapes and lines, each forming a unique melody on the digital canvas. Combining quadrilaterals, I crafted captivating patterns that spoke to the soul, drawing viewers into my art with a magnetic pull.\n\nBeyond shapes, I ventured into crafting backgrounds that breathed life into my creations. Each background became a portal to different worlds, stirring emotions and sparking imaginations. With colors that danced like dreams, my art took on a life of its own, leaving a lasting impression on those who gazed upon it.\n\nTo all fellow art enthusiasts, I extend a heartfelt invitation to explore my generative art collection. Each piece is a testament to the power of perseverance and passion. Just as I grew from a beginner into an art alchemist, I hope my creations find a special place in your heart and home, evoking emotions and sparking your creativity.",

            "description": "Future News is an edition of Generative Web3 Tokens —created in collaboration with the software designer Davide Ciacco— that builds upon Lena Dobrowolska and Teo Ormond-Skeaping's ongoing practice of collaborative scenario-thinking. \n\nWorking with collaborative scenarios thinking methodology, Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping have previously created speculative magazine covers, newspaper front pages, and documents that allude to the current affairs of both difficult and improving climate-changed future scenarios. These works were created alone and in collaboration via artist lead speculative climate storytelling workshops run for climate researchers, policymakers, museum and gallery audiences, and students.\n\nBy asking “what if” questions such as “What if the geoengineers blocked out the sun?” Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping previously reworked the covers and front pages of iconic magazines, newspapers, and documents, with appropriated imagery to tell speculative future news stories that encourage us to stretch our imagination and consider alternative memories of the future. In doing so, the artists intend to reveal how often simplified media narratives frame our understanding of the world and how these narratives give rise to certain types of future scenarios. \n\nWith humanity standing at a fork in the road —one direction leading towards future scenarios full of techno-fixes such as carbon capture storage and geo-engineering and the other direction leading towards justice and equity-based futures that address the root cause of the climate crisis whilst respecting human rights and the rights of nature— it is more important than ever before to become aware of how political, media and scientific narratives shape the way that we perceive the future. In doing so, the artists believe that we will be better positioned to make choices to ensure that techno-deterministic scenario pathways are not used to colonise the future and further suppress the voices of already marginalised indigenous and minority communities by the corporations and institutions most responsible for the climate crisis. \n\nDobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping turned to generative art and web3 technology to expand and further facilitate engagement with speculative storytelling as a means to avoid unlivable climate futures. In collaboration with Davide Ciacco, they worked to design a tool to generate future newspaper and magazine covers as a way to allow the public to develop their own future news stories and narratives from an image data set curated by the artists and through a set of manipulation parameters inspired by global climate simulators such as En-ROADS. Dobrowolska and Ormond-Skeaping see the generator as a research tool that can be used during and in parallel to their scenario’s thinking workshops, one that explores the co-creative potential for climate fiction to shape our climatic futures for the better. \n\nFuture News utilises images under the creative commons licence from image banks and archives that are currently circulating within the digital image ecosystems. In this way, the artists reveal historic and emerging representations of the unfolding climate crisis within the digital commons while continuing to reflect on the dominant scientific and political lenses that are perpetuated through the visual landscape. In this way, the artists continue their critical dialogue with documentary representation which began in response to critical reflections upon their own documentary image-making practice.",

            "description": "Schwere See\n(...which is german for \"Heavy Seas\")\n\nthis work creates completely generative ocean worlds between the real and the surreal.\nwhat is real? when do we feel reality? i guess as with many other things, we feel reality best when we're deprived of it.\nThat might be the reason why it never ceases to fascinate us to both exaggerate and abstract nature and reality - maybe even at the same time.\nthat's where this work tries to go...\ngiving my best to create realistic looking waves out of hmm... thin electron-gas..., and then disrupt those from realism by unnaturally exaggerating waveforms and abstracting the display to a few colors and lines - ...well, not so few of the latter, actually ;-)\n\nbeware: this needs a good GPU (at least here in 2023) to properly run in realtime.\nstills can still be rendered on a low end machine with on-board graphics, but for realtime playing you'd need some proper dedicated graphics card.\nand of course it wont run fast (or maybe not all) on your mobile phone (except maybe on a very high end device).\n\nthe different mints vary in wave shape, color, camera view, animation speed, aspect ratio, frame style, hatching density, field of view, and more.\nsome color schemes are based on pre-chosen palettes (slightly varied though), but others are wildly random-generated. there's always some risk in randomness, but lets give the error some chance to surprise us - this is one of the many benefits of generative art.\n\nas generative art can do so much more than just generate/show an image i feel almost obliged to add the possibility to animate/inteact.\nhowever, this extra control shall not be chosen without some considerations. \nyou don't want a strobingly wild animation above your fireplace or in a doctors waiting room. nor is it motion-wise very inspiring to have subtle image stills hanging in a dancefloor.\nso, by default when in animation mode (<space>-key) the scene is very slowly and steadily changing - some pieces faster, some slower. however, by pressing <f> you can toggle to a sped up animation of waves, clouds, and scene rotation.\nbtw, going faster in nav-mode also speeds up the wave animation. (...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",

            "description": "Design and Form, a fundamental course at the Bauhaus, played a pivotal role in shaping the renowned art school's unique approach to design education. Founded in 1919 by architect Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus sought to bridge the gap between art and industry, promoting the idea that design should be both functional and aesthetically pleasing. The Design and Form course served as a cornerstone of this philosophy, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and techniques that underpin all forms of visual expression.\n\nAt the heart of the Design and Form course was the exploration of the fundamental elements of design, such as line, shape, color, and texture. Students were encouraged to experiment with these elements through hands-on exercises, engaging in a process of discovery and self-expression. The course emphasized the importance of developing a keen sense of observation and a deep understanding of materials, enabling students to create harmonious compositions that seamlessly blended form and function.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features of the Design and Form course was its interdisciplinary nature. The Bauhaus believed that design should transcend traditional boundaries, and students from various disciplines, including painting, sculpture, architecture, and crafts, came together to learn and collaborate. This interdisciplinary approach fostered a rich exchange of ideas, inspiring students to push the boundaries of their respective fields and embrace new ways of thinking. The Design and Form course at the Bauhaus laid the foundation for the school's revolutionary approach to design education, leaving an indelible mark on the world of art and design.\n\n-\tHit s for svg export\n-\tHit p for png export\n\nParams for palette, form factor, mode and composition seed.",

(...so be careful when you accelerate! the ocean is not a ponyfarm.)\n\n\nmouse/keyboard functions:\n\n<mouse move>..........rotate view\n<mouse wheel>.........zoom in/out\n<space>...............start animation (or append '&AnimEnable=1' to the url)\n<ctrl>+<1><2><3><4>...make png screenshot in 1/2/3/4-fold resolution\n<p>...................same as <ctrl>+<3>\n<n>...................toggle nav-mode - navigate/fly through scene\n<w>/<crsr up>.........accelerate in nav-mode\n<s>/<crsr down>.......decelerate in nav-mode\n<a>/<crsr left>.......rotate left in nav-mode\n<d>/<crsr right>......rotate right in nav-mode\n<f>...................fast animation mode (speeds up animation)\n\n\nsome technical info:\n\ntechnically this is a raymarched scene. the distance field of the waves is constructed my many localized rotations on many different scales.\nfor the hatching no actual lines are being drawn. it is archieved by applying periodic functions in world-position-space as halftone patterns to the actual image color. \nthe frequency of these halftone-functions thereby depending on screen-position-derivatives.\n",
