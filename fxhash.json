            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

The color palettes are named after the rivers where artifacts in this design have first been discovered.\n\nURL and interactive features:\n\n- Append &r=<number> to the URL to change the image resolution. For example, &r=0.5 will halve the pixel count along both width and height, and &r=2 will double it.\n\n- Append &d=<number> to the URL to change the pixel density. For example, &d=0.3 will generate a very quick, coarse render, and &d=2 will generate very fine stippling.\n\n- Append &p to the URL to reveal detailed parameter settings used for the artwork.\n\n- Append &h to the URL to suppress the notification that rendering is in progress.\n\n- Press 's' in the live view to save the rendered image as a png.\n\nThe generative code is written in plain JavaScript.

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

In the control bar it's possible to switch among the maps of the affected segments, or to just enjoy the image alterations in full size.\n\nThe fruition of the work is accompanied by a screen providing information about the image and it's parasites and the concise but complete Glitcherspedia with precious svg drawings of the many different glitchers, both accessible by the command bar.",

The basis of these patterns is the binary tree.\nIn each structure, dozens of cubes of random sizes are subtracted or combined with the original cube to produce the final output.\nBut this output is only a solid shape that is not very beautiful.\nTherefore, another algorithm is used to create cuts on these solid shapes.\nIn addition to creating more surfaces, these cuts show the components of each structure separately, which creates a deeper effect.\nAdditionally, this project goes beyond simple color palettes when it comes to its concept of color.\nA color source and a light source with a different color are used for each of the three levels, which the catalyst transforms into an ideal combination.\n\n-The rendering process may take up to two minutes!\n\nMade by p5.js\npress 's' to save original size",

            "description": "Story Gradients is a generative artwork that creates an abstract visual representation of a story through color variation that tracks the narrative arc across sequential comics pages. Color is used to encode the emotional valence of iconic story archetypes, like Rags to Riches (Rise) or Icarus (Rise-Fall). Using the visual language of comics, a sense of pacing is conveyed through the undulations of panel density across the story. Minters can set the visual tone of their story through fx(params).\n------------------------------------\nParameters / features (controllable by the minter)\n* Display theme: Light or Dark\n* Story shape: Fall, Rise, Fall-Rise, Rise-Fall, Fall-Rise-Fall, Rise-Fall-Rise. Controls the emotional value curve, i.e. Fall varies from +1 to -1 from beginning to end.\n* Palette 1: over 50 color palettes to choose from. Determines the color encoding of the positive valence.\n* Palette 2: over 50 color palettes to choose from. Determines the color encoding of the negative valence.\n------------------------------------\nAdditional features (random values set when token is minted)\n* Story length: Very short (12), Short (24), Medium (40), Long (60), Very long (84), Epic (112). Controls the number of pages.\n* Pacing cycles: Half, One, Two, Three, Four, Random. Controls the number of cycles for panel density variation (the number of panels on a page).\n* Opening pacing: Slow, Moderate, Fast. This determines if the story starts out with a low or high panel density.\n------------------------------------\nInteractivity\nPress 's' (desktop) or tap (mobile) to save a high-res PNG (3000x3000).\n------------------------------------\nBuilt using p5.js.\nCreated in April 2023 by @jamieinfinity (Jamie Williams).",

            "description": "Mei(梅):\n\n\"Mei\" is an oriental art piece featuring the imagery of plum blossom, a symbol of courage and perseverance in traditional Chinese culture.\n\nThe generative system at the backend of \"Mei\" is an exploration of this cultural symbol by modern art language. The basic elements of the paintings are merely circles and enclosed flow field shapes. A great variety of short and light strokes of such elements are used across the paintings. Xuan paper is occasionally used as background, which is a painting material since the Tang dynasty.\n\nMei's outputs span different stages of plum blossom from winter to spring. The scene also changes from a calm day to snowy or even stormy weather. The consistent yet complex senses and feelings reflected are surprisingly versatile.",

I woke up, wrote everything I could in my notebook, polished a bit and here we are :)\n\nColors were chosen to bring a feeling of almost alien form: darker palettes, occasional pops of neon paired with the ribbed nature of the pattern can make it feel like some sort of sinister sci fi pop art, like I saw it in my dream.\n\nEditions vary by amplitude, frequency, line mode, color mode, palette, background and accent color.\n\n‘Order’ mode chooses the layered colors based on a set palette of 4 colors (of 16 palettes), while ‘Chaos’ chooses 4 colors of 64 total colors not limited by palette. Accent and Background colors are chosen as one of 64 as well. Chaos mode outputs can be much more interesting than their prebuilt counterparts, but do have the chance to result in flat imagery or unpleasing color palettes.\n\nThere is a 25% chance to output a “Happy Accident” mode image, which was a calculation error that has been made into a feature for sake of its extremely unpredictable behavior. \n\nPress ’s’ to save a .png (image size is tied to window height)",
