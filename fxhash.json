It represents the generative processes driving fxhash tokens. Generative Tokens are fed with a unique hash to produce unique outputs based on the hash — they are functions with a hash as single input.\n\nThe growth that comes out of the text is driven by a \"Dividing-Aggregating Walkers\" (DAW) algorithm. The hash drives all the DAW settings, as well as a mutation factor which is responsible for changes in each Walker parameters as they divide.\n\nSome iterations will produce very simple outputs whereas others might be more chaotic.\n\nPiece by @ciphrd for fxhash",

            "description": "Patterns are present everywhere in the world, and throughout history, they have left their mark on various aspects of human culture and art. I, as a programmer, endeavored to create a series of patterns that deviate from the common repetitive ones that we encounter regularly. In doing so, I strived to break away from the traditional rigid patterns while maintaining the essence of their structure.\n\nAs an artist, it was crucial for me to preserve the harmonious interplay of colors in my work and not simply generate random patterns. I aimed to strike a balance where my generative art would be visually appealing, yet carry a unique artistic essence.\n\nThis NFT has the capacity to generate billions of unique patterns, but only 128 of them will be minted. Owning one of these 128 patterns is a rare opportunity, and each time you look at your artwork, you'll cherish the exclusivity it holds.\n\nTo make this happen, I Programmed 444 lines of pure javascript code in just one week. I put in hours of effort to ensure that the aesthetics were just right, often revising and refining the code multiple times.\n\nI am confident that by acquiring this NFT, you'll experience joy every time you gaze at your NFT. It's not just an NFT; it's a piece of generative art that reflects dedication, creativity, and passion.",

This grid can be used as a basis for stacking a more or less large set of tetragons, and they combine with each other to form polygons, enhanced by a minimalist palette of colors, inspired by the work of Mondrian. The key to this orderly world is the use of the right angle.\n\nThus, everything has its place, and a place exists for everything.\n\n---\n\nYou can download various versions of this artwork :\n\n- press \"p\" to download a PNG at the current resolution of your browser\n- press \"h\" to download a high-resolution PNG (8K) suitable for print\n- press \"s\" to download an SVG version that you can then use to generate any image size\n\n---\n\nCoded with care, and with the help of p5.js, p5.js-svg and polybooljs libraries.\nConsider any bug that you could get in your edition as a blessing from the RNG Gods !",

            "description": "For this collaboration we focused on horizons as an organizing principle.  What are the edges and borders of our vision and what do we see there?\n\nRather than create *one* collective piece where we mix our styles, we instead opted to create essentially a series of works – focusing on our own personal responses to the prompt as well as how we imagine the other responding to the prompt.  Each of us took on three challenges as central modes: \n\nMe as me \nMe as you \nMe as you as me\n\nEach mode has a variety of variations.  This framework allowed for speculation, ambiguity, and time to reflect on our own voice and the voice of our collaborator.   The idea was not to mimic styles but rather use this framework to try to have a conversation and explore what we see in each other’s work.   \n\nZach: \n\nFor me as me, I created a series of block / glitch based images on a simple horizon.  I love creating color field compositions and often find myself staring at them – especially the subtle and luminous ones.  They seemed well suited for exploring horizons.\n\nFor me as you, I focused on Iskra’s use of layers and simple geometry for creating compositions that reframe space.   I am a huge fan of her work – especially how she elevates and uses simple geometry and creates ambiguous forms that reference architectural structures so I enjoyed exploring what I could do with a constraint of just using rectangles.   I see blocks, windows and portals.  \n\nFor me as you as me, I explored light.   Although Iskra’s compositions often use densely overlapped lines and forms there is often a really luminous and airy quality to her works that I deeply resonate with.  She creates curtains and shapes we can see through and I tried to imagine a form of light curtain that Iskra would create to generate my work.  In this mode, a set of color bands are organized along a horizon and overlap to create new spaces and forms. \n\nIskra:\n\nWorking with Zach has been a challenge and a trigger to go beyond my own expectations, limits and the technology itself. Once we made the decision of splitting the work into these three approaches we basically focused on knowing better each one and our work.\n\nStarting with the most difficult mode for me “Me as you ” (How could I recreate the magic lights of Zach?)  After some integration work, I got into something minimal and played with colors, contrast and shadows to recreate this feelight of shine, in my case using just lines. \n\nFor “Me as you as me” I came up immediately with the idea of candies. Not sure why, but somehow I found colors and positive vibes very much associated with Zach’s work and I tried to recreate this idea by playing with sparks, flashes and vivid tones.\n\nLast, “Me as Me” has been like my safe space. I changed easily through more than 5 different systems before getting the right one. The whole project is about Horizons and the idea of divisions, so I decided to focus on the concept of sea. Either a port or a mystic sailing boat, both have some disturbing elements in the scene. Sometimes a mesh –is it possible to reflect this smell of iron? And sometimes an undefined stone cave – is it there to protect us, or to attack us?\n\n-----------\n\nArtist notes  –\n\nNotes by Iskra: \n\nI highly recommend using Chrome for my pieces, especially for high res and downloads. Other browsers as Firefox or Safari have sometimes difficulties to display the work properly due to the structure of thin lines, compositions and overlaps of many of the outputs. \n\nNotes by Zach: \n\nMy sketches require webgl and a relatively newer / modern browser.   Best / optimized for desktop.\n\nFor high resolution and saving on all modes –\nPress “h” to set a high resolution mode.  Alternatively, press “m” to increase the resolution until you want (or until your device allows it) and “l” to reduce it. Use “s” to save the current resolution. \n\n",

With an origin dating back 260 million years to the Triassic period, it is part of the oldest forests on the planet. These ancient trees are endangered due to logging, forest fires, and grazing.\n\nARAUCO is a tribute to araucarias and Mapuche iconography.

This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

            "description": "Urban Planning continues the exploration of abstract and recursively generated architectural systems that I started with the Recursive Architecture series. It plays on my own fascination with scale models and bird's-eye views, as well as technical drawings.\n\nThe number of parameters that can be tweaked was purposefully kept to a minimum. Even the best planners cannot (and maybe should not try to) account for everything.\n\nDuring the late stages of the creative process, I read Jane Jacobs's 1958 essay 'Downtown is for People' and it played an important role in how I decided to frame this work. The last words, especially, stuck with me: 'Designing a dream city is easy; rebuilding a living one takes imagination.'\n\n—\n\nWhat You See Is What You Get: the minter’s wallet and seed parameter are used to seed the algorithm. Your mint will look exactly as it appears in the preview.\n\n—\n\nControls\nS - PNG export\nV - animated SVG export\nG - GIF export\nP - plottable SVG export\nF - fullscreen\nC - hide/show cursor\nSPACE/click - pause/unpause animations\n\n—\n\nCreated by loackme, 2023\n",

            "description": "Thalassophobia is defined as the terror of deep water. The composition features a winding and cyclical path made from colored circles and light texture, which represents how fear consumes and grows.\n\nCircles and paths were chosen to form a visually simple system, and in part because these elements are deeply important symbols.\n\nThe start point for the looping path is randomized for each output. Transparency variations soften the transition where the cycle begins and ends, with the last circle almost completely transparent drawn over the first.\n\nColor gradients were created that smoothly transition and completely cycle, with different start points on each run. The light texturing of lines, varied transparency and partial occlusion cues together create a subtle impression of depth and structure.\n\nEach output from this algorithm features a circuitous path established around 2-6 randomized switchbacks, with small, medium or large circles. Those two characteristics affect the rarity of the output, while the color gradients have equal likelihood among 15 options.\n\nThis system was originally composed in R code, then translated to p5.js for fxhash.\n\nVerified NFT collectors can purchase a fine art print for their unique token at vadenart.com\n\n\nAbout the artist: Kenny Vaden is a generative artist based in Charleston, SC. His art experience included drawing, painting, stained glass apprenticeships, and nature photography. Vaden’s code-based artworks are available online as limited edition or single edition fine art prints, as well as NFTs on Quantum.art, Flamingo DAO Flutter, OpenSea, Objkt, and Foundation.
