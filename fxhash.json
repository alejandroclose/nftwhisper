            "description": "“Southern Gothic” is my debut release on the fxhash platform. The project is created entirely through code. All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n“Southern Gothic” borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",

It can take up to 1-5 minutes to fully render, depending on your hardware configuration, including a 15sec-1min loading phase during which lots of calculations take place (but no visuals). It'll get there, just be patient! A small loading bar along the bottom also shows the progression of the render during the drawing phase.\n\nPress 'S' or click \"Save image\" to save a PNG version of the artwork while in full-screen/IPFS view\n\nCustomisation\n-------------\n\nThe following parameters can be adjusted in full-screen mode.\nOpen the token in full-screen/IPFS mode, and add any of these to the URL:\n\n&size=2000 (replace 2000 with any value up to around 8000) - this sets the resolution/width of the canvas in pixels. Use this to generate very large PNG images (50MB+) suitable for printing at large DPI & canvas sizes. The max value here is dependent on your hardware, might not work on mobiles etc.\n\n&ratio=1.4 (any value between 1 and 2, default = 1.4) - set the aspect ratio of the work. By default Whisper renders at 1:1.4 but you can change this to match other printing formats. Different ratios will produce slightly different outputs, but the overall character of the artwork should still be present. Landscape mode is not supported.",

Each minute is an AI prose output, a fragment of a novel that doesn't exist, generated from the time itself.\n\nThe form factor is ideal for smaller window sizes and displays, although it will scale to any size. With the right device, you could probably wear it on your wrist.\n\nNearly 5,000 unique text templates are included, many of which feature variable character names, for which I sourced approximately 1.8 million possible first names and 150,000 possible surnames from U.S. Census data: https://github.com/rossgoodwin/american-names\n\nI wanted to provide just enough text for each minute so that you could read the whole excerpt before the minute ends, though you might need to read briskly.

About the role:\n\nThe element on the screen is basically the metaphor for every object/person in your current life.\n\nAs the ACTOR, you can make choice under your instant willingness and travel in this world with limited time.\n\nAs the OBSERVER you can watch the above and question and dialogue with the ACTOR and alter its choice.\n\n2. About the visualizations:\n\nIn order to present our big world in a limited 2D graphical approach. I shrink the dimensions and the detail of the existing reality.\n\nHumans and Objects are dots, 3D entities like us become tiny dots (zero dimension) on a 3D space where their activity is backward translated to 2D perspective coordinates\n\nInteractions between two entities are lines, and in our world planes or shapes were formed when interactions involved multiple people or objects. Which becomes an event.\n\nWe now as observer from the higher ground can witness the events’ change, progress, and karma by the continuous growth of the plane into various shapes.\n\nEvery world we reincarnated back into will have a visual color and an audio color tone. It is considered to be the theme of that particular life.\n\nThe final composition becomes a mix of the above, everything is merely the same but everything yet looks different. Depends on your perspective.\"\n\n3. Some personal sharing thru creating REIN:\n\nLife is short - I am happy if you are feeling annoyed and you feel the screen comes and fades so fast. Indeed this is my personal feeling about life, too short and things ended before you realize it.\n\nSome life is super long and boring - I am also happy if you felt so. So sing and discover your song of life when you are in the room. It happens once only with this combination.\n\nNo time to prepare/predict/prejudge - but you can enjoy cause you/he/she/it/they/we will end in here suddenly. So enjoy the up and down, sweet and sour of every bit.\n\nThere is always an intangible target and goal preset to you, and it cast a line between you and it. You can choose to ignore it or be actively chasing it. But no matter which choices you made, your locus was left and shown in front of your eyes.\n\n4. Observer’s responsibility and award\nThis work inspires me that in life we can both be the actors/actress and also the observer.\n\nWhat matters more to you?\nThe background, your choice, or both?\nAre you the observer guy who sits and doesn’t move?\nAre you moving towards the [goal] linking with you? Do you keep chasing it?\nAre you caring about the background more? Do you have a feeling they somehow related to you?\nOr do you simply move your life freely without caring about the other happening?\nYour voice is too loud or not?\nWill you find the background noise too loud?\nWhat can you do with it?\nIf the target connected to you is hollow and empty, would you still care about it?\n\nAnd Why? Why do you feel so?\nWhich part of the above dialogue is related to your existing life?\nWhat can we do/change/keep?\nWhat you really can control?\"\n\n\n// [Click] - The sound of the work can be muted by clicking again the screen\n// [s] - Take a selfie of this world and you inside\n// [spacebar] - you can stop the time and walk/think freely like NEO in the matrix\n\nBehind [REIN]\nAs a generative artist, I force myself to seek the possible ways to use these tools/skills/presentation forms.\n\nIn Traveler, it is about finding the difference between being alone and feeling loneliness\nIn FEA, it is about possibilities\nIn BULLET, it is about courage and faith\nIn REIN, I hope we can treasure what we lost and gained.\n\nArt to me can be the visualization of aesthetics or a mutually enjoyable creative process for you and me.\n\nOr like this time in REIN.\n\nA journey towards our room inside our heart shape box.",

            "description": "“Southern Gothic” is my debut release on the fxhash platform. The project is created entirely through code. All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n“Southern Gothic” borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",

            "description": "“Southern Gothic” is my debut release on the fxhash platform. The project is created entirely through code. All copyrights are released to the holder of each image output, even for commercial purposes.\n\n“Southern Gothic” borrows its name from the literary genre made famous by writers like Flannery O’Connor and Carson McCullers. Rather than illustrating a singular setting, the code generates an entire rural townscape, thereby, blurring the boundaries between representation and narrative. The individual scenes are framed frontally with an intentionally flat aesthetic character, referencing traditional folk art of the American South. The absence of human figures within these scenes adds to their overwhelming sense of darkness and forlorn. Observing multiple scenes side-by-side, one may even get the strange feeling that something terrible has happened (or is about to happen) in this rural landscape.\n\nPressing the down arrow saves the coded output as a .png image.\n",
