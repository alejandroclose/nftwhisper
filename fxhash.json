            "description": "There is no light without dark.\n\nLuminaries is a study in symmetry, contrast and flow, with a palette inspired by the twelve full moon names. Owning a Luminary enables you to request a signed print for an additional fee. \n\nYou can learn more about features and prints at: https://www.phaust.art/luminary\n\nEach Luminary is composed of moons in various phases. Their layout derived from a handful of geometries. They contrast with their surroundings: filled with glittering stars, inky strokes or solid colour. \n\nBackgrounds can split along lines of symmetry – with dark and light contrasting as strokes seamlessly flow across the two halves. \n\nLuminaries are alive. They’re in retrograde once a month, a day in which you’ll see yours in a new light.\n\n------\n\nCollection Size: 158. One for each of the confirmed moons in our solar system.\n\nPalettes: 12 + 1. One for each of the full moons plus a rarer secret palette: Wolf, Snow, Worm, Pink, Flower, Strawberry, Buck, Sturgeon, Harvest, Hunter, Beaver, Cold, ????.\n\nRetrograde: day of the month that your Luminary will change for one day only.\n\nS: to save at high resolution. \n\nPrints: request from https://www.phaust.art/luminary",

            "description": "Another adventure in narrated horology: this work features entirely new texts, authored by AI that I trained on a set of novels. Each minute is an AI prose output, a fragment of a novel that doesn't exist, generated from the time itself.\n\nThe form factor is ideal for smaller window sizes and displays, although it will scale to any size. With the right device, you could probably wear it on your wrist.\n\nNearly 5,000 unique text templates are included, many of which feature variable character names, for which I sourced approximately 1.8 million possible first names and 150,000 possible surnames from U.S. Census data: https://github.com/rossgoodwin/american-names\n\nI wanted to provide just enough text for each minute so that you could read the whole excerpt before the minute ends, though you might need to read briskly. None of the passages have been edited manually, and some remain quite glitchy, as intended. You may recognize a few motifs or proper names here and there, depending on the books you're familiar with, but each passage remains wholly original otherwise.\n\nEach edition features either a linear or nonlinear text sequence:\n\nNonlinear editions will all show one of two possible template texts for each minute, and will read like fragments from multiple (strange and glitchy) novels. Nonlinear sequences feature independently generated texts, with variable character names unique to each minute of each edition.\n\nLinear editions will all show the same template text for each minute, and will read like (strange and glitchy) 24-hour novels. For linear sequences, I utilized a generative prompting technique in which each minute's text is generated partially from the text of the minute before it. Variable character names for linear sequences are unique to each edition and repeat throughout the day.\n\nAesthetic possibilities for each edition include 16 color palettes, 8 fonts, 7 depths, 5 types of numerals, and 3 types of hands. Some editions have color-accented second hands and minute marks, while others appear more static and minimalist, without any numerals or second hand at all.\n\nThis token relies on p5.js for the clockwork, vanilla JS for the text.\n\n\n\nDouble click to toggle fullscreen.\n\nPush `d` to download current minute's text as a .txt file.",

            "description": "There is no light without dark.\n\nLuminaries is a study in symmetry, contrast and flow, with a palette inspired by the twelve full moon names. Owning a Luminary enables you to request a signed print for an additional fee. \n\nYou can learn more about features and prints at: https://www.phaust.art/luminary\n\nEach Luminary is composed of moons in various phases. Their layout derived from a handful of geometries. They contrast with their surroundings: filled with glittering stars, inky strokes or solid colour. \n\nBackgrounds can split along lines of symmetry – with dark and light contrasting as strokes seamlessly flow across the two halves. \n\nLuminaries are alive. They’re in retrograde once a month, a day in which you’ll see yours in a new light.\n\n------\n\nCollection Size: 158. One for each of the confirmed moons in our solar system.\n\nPalettes: 12 + 1. One for each of the full moons plus a rarer secret palette: Wolf, Snow, Worm, Pink, Flower, Strawberry, Buck, Sturgeon, Harvest, Hunter, Beaver, Cold, ????.\n\nRetrograde: day of the month that your Luminary will change for one day only.\n\nS: to save at high resolution. \n\nPrints: request from https://www.phaust.art/luminary",

            "description": "In 1970, mathematician John Conway devised his eponymous \"Game of Life\", also known simply as \"Life\", a cellular automaton that plays out on a 2D grid of orthogonal cells. The game requires a starting configuration of \"living\" cells (all other cells are assumed to be \"dead\"), and at each discrete step forward in time, the following transformations occur:\n\n- Every living cell with fewer than two living neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.\n- Every living cell with more than three living neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.\n- Every living cell with exactly two or three living neighbors survives.\n- Every dead cell with exactly three living neighbors comes to life, as if by reproduction.\n- Every dead cell without exactly three living neighbors remains dead.\n\nConway's Game of Life feels very simple at its outset. And yet, computer scientists have discovered a staggering degree of complexity, and a vast lexicon of dynamic forms, all within the bounds of its highly constrained 2D universe. It is Turing complete, meaning that given a large enough grid and an appropriate starting configuration, it's possible to create a functional computer inside Game of Life. Given unlimited processing power and memory, one could run Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life inside Game of Life... ad infinitum.\n\nBut what would it look like for a small percentage of living cells on the grid, in the course of their \"lives\", to write some poetry?\n\nWhat if each living cell also could increment somehow at each time step it stayed alive, imbuing cells with a visible age?\n\n\"Life in The Waste Land\" is Conway's Game of Life applied to poetry -- more specifically, a poem: The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot.\n\nIn this implementation of Game of Life, the grid is monospaced text, and each living cell has a very small chance of generating a few lines, all entirely inspired by The Waste Land. Each token will track its unique starting configuration's progress forever. The grid is infinite, and the dynamic patterns extend far beyond the fixed boundaries of your screen. Some tokens will remain dynamic for a very long time, while others will settle down quickly, at which point continuously living cells may iterate through nearly every Unicode character.\n\nThank you for collecting. Please enjoy.",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

Inspired by childhood memories that passed through the watercolor sketches of my mother, who was an artist, the piece reflects my admiration for her work and her influence on my own artistic endeavors. \nIntricate forms contrast with the strict forms of cells. All these are echoes from childhood - watercolor lines of a child not bothered by a special artistic idea but trying at least to a fraction of mastering the fine arts and cubes reminiscent of ones which children use to build towers.\nOverall, the piece is a tribute to the joy and creativity of childhood, and to the power of artistic inspiration that can be passed down from one generation to the next.\n\nMade with p5js and a few GLSL shaders.

Through this artwork, I attempt to visually represent the complex and often overwhelming emotions that I experience on a daily basis. It is a reflection of the cyclical nature of my thoughts and feelings, and the ways in which I try to make sense of them. But as I delve deeper into my own personal experiences, I realize that in the end, internal chaos should not be controlled, but accepted.\n\nThis artwork is my most personal, as it reflects my innermost sensations. It is a reminder to myself and to others that it is okay to not have everything under control, and that it is important to allow the uncertainty and unpredictability of life. I hope that it will resonate with others and provide a sense of connection and understanding. It is a reminder that we are not alone in our struggles and that it is important to embrace our own imperfections.\n\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.
