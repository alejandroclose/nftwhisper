            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",

            "description": "RAUSCH is a series of generative artworks that explore imaginary digital architectures. \n\nThis series challenges traditional notions of architectural representation and raises important questions about the role of resolution in design. Just as the pixel resolution of an image affects its perceived quality, the resolution of an architectural space can affect its qualities and livability. By embracing digital variation through codes, this series explores the interplay between abstract and concrete space through multiple resolutions. \n\nRAUSCH is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by complex, chaotic and messy sensations, and aims to engage the viewer through a sense of wonder, disorientation, and awe.\n\nReleased on the occasion of Companions of Code, a group exhibition by VerticalCrypto Art at The NFT Gallery in London. \nCurated by Micol Ap. Exhibition 10-24 February 2023 \n\n___________________________________________________\nRAUSCH Controls:\n\nAnimation: \n• ‘1 - 2 - 3 - 4’ animate views\n• 'MouseClick' pause/play animation\n\nFunctions:\n(press key & wait)\n• 'F' 24 FPS\n• 'B' b/w mode \n\nResize Canvas:\n(press key & wait)\n• '6' Portrait A4 - 1000x1414\n• '7' Landscape 16:9 - 1920x1080\n• '8' Portrait 9:16 - 1080x1920\n• '9' Square 1:1 - 1024x1024\n• 'DoubleClick' Fullscreen\n\nSave & Export Image:\n• 'S' save a .png of in current resolution\n\nSave & Export GIF:\n• 'G' save a 1-2 sec. seamless loop .gif of current view \n• 'P' save a 12-24 sec. seamless loop .gif of all the views\n• 'T’ scale down current resolution, save a 12 sec. seamless loop .gif\n\nSteps to save a gif/png :\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• resize canvas with 6,7,8, or 9 to your desired aspect ratio (wait)\n• press S,G or P to save & download (wait) \n• enjoy RAUSCH :)\n\nSave & Export GIF for social media sharing:\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• press T or G wait for recalculation & download. \n• enjoy RAUSCH \n• post on Twitter ;)\n__________________________________________________\n\nThis token may not work on mobile(!), but it allows exporting .png and .gif (see controls) to enjoy RAUSCH on different displays or mobile.

            "description": "\"I used to live in a small city placed at the center of Iran's plateau with the warmest summer days in the country part; spending most of my childhood with my sweet grandma at her old house. She was always keeping her eyes on me not to get heat stroke at noon playing in the yard when the sun was at its peak glowing furiously. Sundays at noon were my favorite, I used to call them “Ice cream” noons sitting beside the nicest person you could imagine and enjoying a delightful ice cream. You won't know how lovely it was to have an ice cream relaxing under the most enjoyable cold breeze of the tallest windcatcher in the city at her house. \"\n\n\n\nThe Badgirs city is the first collaboration between Fleep and IceRain on Fxhash. The concept was established first with the design of a school with a feeling of safe and nostalgia reminding us of the good memories of our childhood as the grandma’s house and the windcatcher for Fleep.\nA windcatcher (Badgir) is an Iranian traditional architectural element in the form of a small tower built on the roof of houses in warm locations to create passive cooling. The collection of Badgirs city is a modern recreational development of those traditional windcatchers designed by Fleep and icerain and exquisitely translated into code by Icerain.\n\nControls:\n[1] Set the resolution to Medium Resolution\n[2] Set the resolution to High Resolution",

To express themselves, in multitudes of colors, they have evolved novel gene pools.\n\nA Cellulaire may have inside itself yet bigger cells; those created by its surface intersecting itself. And on its membrane that is porous, it hosts whimsical vesicles, or maybe a lotus; sometimes hiding in private quarters, draped with fanciful silk, velvet, or lace.\n\nBut let's go beyond all this hocus pocus.\n\nSome Cellulaires look like chapels; light peeking through their stained glass windows. Others look more like walled gardens, orchards, or vineyards of grapes. And some look like modern architectural spaces; have you ever stood or walked inside the Sequence (by Richard Serra)? To me, a Cellulaire is a meditation about life itself: how all systems and organisms, natural or man-made, are modular and cellular, built from smaller subsystems with their own boundaries and membranes, that interact, communicate, and evolve together, giving rise to ever more complex systems, patterns, structures, and behaviors. \n\nWith all that, the lotus now invites you to a meditative focus while this opus is rendered on its locus.\n\nControls:\n- Click the mouse to pause/unpause.\n- Press 's' to save a PNG file.\n- Press 't' to toggle, for a larger and higher resolution version that might be partially off screen.

            "description": "Quartzamata thinks outside the box; yet it is framed inside a box. Looking with fresh eyes, it explores how the visualization of 1D Cellular Automata can be elevated to higher dimensions and heights. \n\nIn my previously published generative artworks utilizing CAs, I had explored novel ways of coloring them (in AutomataLands); used them to texturize and colorize other generative works (in AutomataPunks); and had planted mixed species of such lacy colorful CAs on curved 3D surfaces (in Cellulaire).\n\nIn Quartzamata, I turn CA visualizations into high dimensional objects and sculptures. A Quartzamata's cells are not mere flat squares on a 2D grid, colored with 2, 4, or even 8 colors. Instead, each cell is a complex, decorated, and colorful 3D object. What creates a Quartzamata's global 3D form and structure is the bending and twisting, and carving and shaping, of the cells and their 2D grid in a multitude of ways. And while some Quartzamata are static and lifeless, others are dynamic and alive organisms.\n\nThe novel concept of decorating CA cells, that I am introducing in Quartzamata, adds an extra layer of visual beauty and complexity to CA patterns; it turns them into objects and structures with intricate repeating patterns of colorful shapes and symbols, reminiscent of many types of human-made artifacts, such as wallpapers, tapestries, rugs, textiles, mosaics, embroidery, beadwork, and lace.\n\nQuartzamata twists and turns, and just like a key it unlocks the box that contains its predecessors; exotic species of CA that not only exhibited richer and more complex patterns, but also were the first to stealthily acquire the gene for decorated cells. And that's another twist and turn; this one in the lineage of Quartzamata itself.\n\nGrab a key, spot the puns, and have some fun!\n\nControls:\nUse 'h' to turn the interactive mode off/on, and to save energy.\nWhen in interactive mode use: \n\t'b' : to hide/reveal the box framing the Quartzamata. \n\t'n' : to remove/add the noisy texture/aura around the Quartzamata.\n\t'c' : to add/remove background color. \n\t'l' (small L) : to turn lights on/off. The mouse controls the location of the light source. \n\tleft/right arrows : to set the Quartzamata into rotating left/right. \n\tup/down arrows : to speed up/down the rotation. \n\t'p' : to pause the rotation.\n\t'f' : to toggle on/off the full-screen mode. Note that resizing the screen resets the scene.\n\t's' : to save a screenshot as a PNG file. Maximize your browser window to maximize the size of the PNG.\nTo enable high-resolution screenshots, add the following to the end of the URL: ?HD=1\nUse the mouse/trackball/touch to move around the Quartzamata. Turning off the noise and lights help speed up navigation. The more complex a Quartzamata, the heavier and thus harder it is to move around.\n\nLicense:\nSee included LICENSE.md\n\nCredits:\nMade in p5js and WebGL.\n\nArtist: Vida V.",

            "description": "Quartzamata thinks outside the box; yet it is framed inside a box. Looking with fresh eyes, it explores how the visualization of 1D Cellular Automata can be elevated to higher dimensions and heights. \n\nIn my previously published generative artworks utilizing CAs, I had explored novel ways of coloring them (in AutomataLands); used them to texturize and colorize other generative works (in AutomataPunks); and had planted mixed species of such lacy colorful CAs on curved 3D surfaces (in Cellulaire).\n\nIn Quartzamata, I turn CA visualizations into high dimensional objects and sculptures. A Quartzamata's cells are not mere flat squares on a 2D grid, colored with 2, 4, or even 8 colors. Instead, each cell is a complex, decorated, and colorful 3D object. What creates a Quartzamata's global 3D form and structure is the bending and twisting, and carving and shaping, of the cells and their 2D grid in a multitude of ways. And while some Quartzamata are static and lifeless, others are dynamic and alive organisms.\n\nThe novel concept of decorating CA cells, that I am introducing in Quartzamata, adds an extra layer of visual beauty and complexity to CA patterns; it turns them into objects and structures with intricate repeating patterns of colorful shapes and symbols, reminiscent of many types of human-made artifacts, such as wallpapers, tapestries, rugs, textiles, mosaics, embroidery, beadwork, and lace.\n\nQuartzamata twists and turns, and just like a key it unlocks the box that contains its predecessors; exotic species of CA that not only exhibited richer and more complex patterns, but also were the first to stealthily acquire the gene for decorated cells. And that's another twist and turn; this one in the lineage of Quartzamata itself.\n\nGrab a key, spot the puns, and have some fun!\n\nControls:\nUse 'h' to turn the interactive mode off/on, and to save energy.\nWhen in interactive mode use: \n\t'b' : to hide/reveal the box framing the Quartzamata. \n\t'n' : to remove/add the noisy texture/aura around the Quartzamata.\n\t'c' : to add/remove background color. \n\t'l' (small L) : to turn lights on/off. The mouse controls the location of the light source. \n\tleft/right arrows : to set the Quartzamata into rotating left/right. \n\tup/down arrows : to speed up/down the rotation. \n\t'p' : to pause the rotation.\n\t'f' : to toggle on/off the full-screen mode. Note that resizing the screen resets the scene.\n\t's' : to save a screenshot as a PNG file. Maximize your browser window to maximize the size of the PNG.\nTo enable high-resolution screenshots, add the following to the end of the URL: ?HD=1\nUse the mouse/trackball/touch to move around the Quartzamata. Turning off the noise and lights help speed up navigation. The more complex a Quartzamata, the heavier and thus harder it is to move around.\n\nLicense:\nSee included LICENSE.md\n\nCredits:\nMade in p5js and WebGL.\n\nArtist: Vida V.",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",
