            "description": "Sol is a companion project that complements my recent series, Metamorphosis. Both projects share a common foundation - a cellular automata engine. The state of each cell in a new generation is influenced by its own state as well as those of its neighboring cells from the last generation. The rules guiding these state transitions, however, are dynamic.\n\nSol for me is an experimental plotter project. As a gesture of my gratitude to minters of Metamorphosis, all minters will be on the reserve list for a free piece of Sol. I’ll take a snapshot of Metamorphosis for the reserve list 30 minutes prior to Sol’s launch. For three days (unless all reserve-holders mint sooner), Sol will be only for those on the reserve list and I'll add anyone who purchases Metamorphosis on primary subsequently. After this period, any remaining pieces, along with an additional 50 mints, will be available for public sale.\n\nA Note on the Name: The inspiration behind the name 'Sol' springs from my visits to SF MoMA, where I always find myself in the space dedicated to Sol LeWitt. Through the repetition and variation of a singular concept, LeWitt constructed forms that were striking, often evolving from basic geometric forms into intricate structures. The same is also echoed in the principle of emergence in cellular automata, where complex systems arise from the interactions of simple components governed by rules. This series, Sol, is a homage to LeWitt's ingenuity in favoring dispassionate geometric forms over the emotionally-infused abstract art styles.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete svg file for plotting. To download three separate svg files with individual colors for plotting press 1,2 & 3. Running an optimization tool can help decrease the plotting time.\n\nPixel Love!\n",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

Afterwards, the pieces are painted according to the color palettes, so that viewers can feel the effect of colors.\nEach piece is processed until the frame part is reached.\n\nFully generated by p5.js\n\nPress 's' to get a 3000x3000 px PNG file.",

There are only two forces at play: gravity towards the center, and repulsion between the particles, which becomes more or less strong depending on the underlying force field. In other words, it is like the particles “shrink” or “grow” depending on their position.\nThese simple conditions create emergent behavior with most particles moving in loops, analogous to convective cells in a fluid with heterogeneous densities. \nPress [m] to show the particles and see the system dynamics more clearly. You can also double click/tap anywhere on the screen to move the center of gravity and generate a different drawing from the same force field. \n\nThis script will adapt nicely to any screen size and ratio.\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[Double click / tap] to relocate the center of gravity\n[r] to recenter gravity and restart the drawing\n[m] to toggle between path drawing and particle swarm views\n[i] to reveal the hidden force field\n[s] to download capture\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at 2x, 3x, … your viewport size (wait for the drawing to finish – might take longer at higher resolutions)\n\nMade with p5.js.
