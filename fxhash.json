            "description": "Benjamin Franklin famously remarked that in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. We have never quite managed to disprove him on the latter.\n\nAt its core, death carries a straightforward definition: the complete cessation of life processes, an inevitable fate for all living organisms. While we grasp the technical definition, no one possesses the faintest notion of what occurs to an individual after they pass away.\n\nPersonally, I've always been fascinated by the idea of death. Since I was a child, I've found myself empathizing with the suffering of others and who I am today has been shaped by the losses I've experienced in my life.\n\nTo bring this project to life I gathered my thoughts and memories and I coded nightly to visually represent the felt experience of the mystery of death, intentionally using a single line to symbolize life's continuity, from start to finish.\n\nAs the project progressed, I realized the multitude of perspectives surrounding the subject. From losing a loved one to facing our own demise, from being on death row to dying while saving someone else. Whether dying young or after a long, fulfilling life. The pain of losing a child, the weight of taking another's life, the grief of losing a pet, or even the simple act of killing a mosquito—what lies beyond? How long can an object hold a memory? Can it transcend the rituals of ceremony, the solemnity of cemeteries, the grandeur of mausoleums?\n\nI invited eight artist friends to participate in this project by contributing a short phrase, or poem capturing a facet of their feelings about death. I then visually riffed on each submission.\nThere are a total of 16 different profiles, each appearing 5 times but never identical. Each output will enable its owner to redeem a physical plot at an additional cost. This means there could be a maximum of 5 signed and numbered plots for each profile in existence, all unique.\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude to Atelier Art for organizing the Visual Poetry exhibition and assisting me every step of the way, both in helping me articulate what I truly wanted to convey and in executing the concept effectively. In the end, the beauty of an art practice truly lies in the human connections it fosters.\n\nA special thanks goes to my fellow artists who participated in enriching this journey:\n\nÆther               @aethersovereign\nAlessandro Fiore    @whitekross\nHarvey McFly        @HarveyMcFly\nPaul Prudence       @MrPrudence\nPureSpider          @PureSpider\nQUBYT               @qUBYt2\nsantiago            @neymrqz\nSh!g                @shig_nft\n\n--------------------------------------\n- Press 1,2,3 or 4 to re-render the artwork at progressively higher resolution\n- Press S to save a PNG image of the artwork\n- Click and drag over the image to adjust the drawing speed of the line\n- Double-click on the image to restart the drawing process from the beginning\n--------------------------------------\nDedicated to my great friend Vale, who knows when to tell me to shut the fuck up.",

Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch D (Disruption). The grid is broken. The color palette from Sketches A, B, and C remains. Most outputs are simply single colors or black and white. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.\n\nPress the spacebar to see the unDisturbed structure.",

Eliot\n\n---\n\nAlpinism is a tribute to the rugged and wild landscapes that rise around us. Which may at once intrigue, impress, intimidate, and inspire.\n\nI am captivated by the mythology of these settings. Where natural shapes appear fantastical. A ridge line drawn by pen meets sky poured out from neon gradient. Where observation is made through the lens of imagination.\n\nEach piece begins with the concept of a mountain landscape. A number of ranges are drawn by pen in one of three styles. Within each style is a spectrum of variation that produces different drawn qualities. The backdrop may be an imagined sky, an impossible sunset, a piece of parchment. A testament to the interpreter’s memory of the scene. \n\n---\n- Made with p5js in the White Mountains of NH July 2022\n- press s to save png\n",

            "description": "Sketch is an open-ended series. Works evolve as I code a generative project, sometimes drastically. Intermediate works usually don't see the light of day - they get archived and forgotten. This series is snapshots of different forms along the way - each standing alone, but also part of a larger meandering work flow. The word Sketch implies incompleteness. This project may end up being two works, or it could evolve for years. Part of the joy of generative art is never knowing what's around the corner. I have no set schedule. There may be multiple Sketches released a week, or it could be weeks or months between drops. I have no idea where Sketch is heading and there is no guarantee of cohesiveness from Sketch to Sketch. Color palettes and forms will change as new ideas are explored.\n\nSketch D (Disruption). The grid is broken. The color palette from Sketches A, B, and C remains. Most outputs are simply single colors or black and white. Grid size, padding, and colors vary.\n\nPress the spacebar to see the unDisturbed structure.",

The robot is like an extension of the artist’s arm, allowing him to create infinite iterations and variations.\n\nThe dots pattern and their density help create the illusion of shadows, gradients and brightness, a technique inherited from the pointillism movement, born in Belgium and France in the late 19th century.\n",

            "description": "Benjamin Franklin famously remarked that in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. We have never quite managed to disprove him on the latter.\n\nAt its core, death carries a straightforward definition: the complete cessation of life processes, an inevitable fate for all living organisms. While we grasp the technical definition, no one possesses the faintest notion of what occurs to an individual after they pass away.\n\nPersonally, I've always been fascinated by the idea of death. Since I was a child, I've found myself empathizing with the suffering of others and who I am today has been shaped by the losses I've experienced in my life.\n\nTo bring this project to life I gathered my thoughts and memories and I coded nightly to visually represent the felt experience of the mystery of death, intentionally using a single line to symbolize life's continuity, from start to finish.\n\nAs the project progressed, I realized the multitude of perspectives surrounding the subject. From losing a loved one to facing our own demise, from being on death row to dying while saving someone else. Whether dying young or after a long, fulfilling life. The pain of losing a child, the weight of taking another's life, the grief of losing a pet, or even the simple act of killing a mosquito—what lies beyond? How long can an object hold a memory? Can it transcend the rituals of ceremony, the solemnity of cemeteries, the grandeur of mausoleums?\n\nI invited eight artist friends to participate in this project by contributing a short phrase, or poem capturing a facet of their feelings about death. I then visually riffed on each submission.\nThere are a total of 16 different profiles, each appearing 5 times but never identical. Each output will enable its owner to redeem a physical plot at an additional cost. This means there could be a maximum of 5 signed and numbered plots for each profile in existence, all unique.\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude to Atelier Art for organizing the Visual Poetry exhibition and assisting me every step of the way, both in helping me articulate what I truly wanted to convey and in executing the concept effectively. In the end, the beauty of an art practice truly lies in the human connections it fosters.\n\nA special thanks goes to my fellow artists who participated in enriching this journey:\n\nÆther               @aethersovereign\nAlessandro Fiore    @whitekross\nHarvey McFly        @HarveyMcFly\nPaul Prudence       @MrPrudence\nPureSpider          @PureSpider\nQUBYT               @qUBYt2\nsantiago            @neymrqz\nSh!g                @shig_nft\n\n--------------------------------------\n- Press 1,2,3 or 4 to re-render the artwork at progressively higher resolution\n- Press S to save a PNG image of the artwork\n- Click and drag over the image to adjust the drawing speed of the line\n- Double-click on the image to restart the drawing process from the beginning\n--------------------------------------\nDedicated to my great friend Vale, who knows when to tell me to shut the fuck up.",

Be aware that this will only work on a machine with a very beefy GPU, and even then may take a bit, so please be patient!",

            "description": "Benjamin Franklin famously remarked that in this world, nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes. We have never quite managed to disprove him on the latter.\n\nAt its core, death carries a straightforward definition: the complete cessation of life processes, an inevitable fate for all living organisms. While we grasp the technical definition, no one possesses the faintest notion of what occurs to an individual after they pass away.\n\nPersonally, I've always been fascinated by the idea of death. Since I was a child, I've found myself empathizing with the suffering of others and who I am today has been shaped by the losses I've experienced in my life.\n\nTo bring this project to life I gathered my thoughts and memories and I coded nightly to visually represent the felt experience of the mystery of death, intentionally using a single line to symbolize life's continuity, from start to finish.\n\nAs the project progressed, I realized the multitude of perspectives surrounding the subject. From losing a loved one to facing our own demise, from being on death row to dying while saving someone else. Whether dying young or after a long, fulfilling life. The pain of losing a child, the weight of taking another's life, the grief of losing a pet, or even the simple act of killing a mosquito—what lies beyond? How long can an object hold a memory? Can it transcend the rituals of ceremony, the solemnity of cemeteries, the grandeur of mausoleums?\n\nI invited eight artist friends to participate in this project by contributing a short phrase, or poem capturing a facet of their feelings about death. I then visually riffed on each submission.\nThere are a total of 16 different profiles, each appearing 5 times but never identical. Each output will enable its owner to redeem a physical plot at an additional cost. This means there could be a maximum of 5 signed and numbered plots for each profile in existence, all unique.\n\nI would like to express my deep gratitude to Atelier Art for organizing the Visual Poetry exhibition and assisting me every step of the way, both in helping me articulate what I truly wanted to convey and in executing the concept effectively. In the end, the beauty of an art practice truly lies in the human connections it fosters.\n\nA special thanks goes to my fellow artists who participated in enriching this journey:\n\nÆther               @aethersovereign\nAlessandro Fiore    @whitekross\nHarvey McFly        @HarveyMcFly\nPaul Prudence       @MrPrudence\nPureSpider          @PureSpider\nQUBYT               @qUBYt2\nsantiago            @neymrqz\nSh!g                @shig_nft\n\n--------------------------------------\n- Press 1,2,3 or 4 to re-render the artwork at progressively higher resolution\n- Press S to save a PNG image of the artwork\n- Click and drag over the image to adjust the drawing speed of the line\n- Double-click on the image to restart the drawing process from the beginning\n--------------------------------------\nDedicated to my great friend Vale, who knows when to tell me to shut the fuck up.",

            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac.

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",
