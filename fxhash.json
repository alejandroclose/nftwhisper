            "description": "The preparations for the first mission began in 2142. It had become clear that mining petroleum on Earth would soon become financially unfeasible, so looking to other planets was the only logical choice. It took seventeen more years to perfect the technology so that the first colonists could reach Proxima b within the lifetime of one generation.\n\nAfter 45 years of travelling at almost one-tenth of the speed of light, they reached their new home. It was rich in petrochemicals but scarce in the nutrients necessary for long term human survival. After merely six generations, humanity was forced to travel once again in search of a new world. The four missions that parted from the Proxima system to colonise other possibly habitable planets in the galaxy sparked a new age of human civilisation that would never see itself united and thriving again.\n\nEventually, all the colonies became independent societies as their differing interests drove them apart. Each small civilisation chose its path, wandering the void of space alone. Over time, millions of kilometres apart, each colony developed its own culture and traditions. While their habits and customs changed, some things remained the same across all the societies, like how it became a certain tradition to convert the outer world years and days to Earth time and celebrate holidays according to the calendar of the old world.\n\nThe new nomads learned from the first pilgrims. They used the technology once optimised for oil extraction to traverse other worlds, searching for sustenance. Peculiar wandering nonspaces emerged from the involuntary degrowth of human civilisation.\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments.

            "description": "The idea of living within close proximity to nature has enticed people for centuries, especially for the ones used to living in bustling cities. Just picturing a cozy resort in the countryside, or playing music that resembles the feelings of holiday-making can drive us to go on a well-deserved vacation. Even when we don’t know where to, or whether we have the time or resources to slip out of our busy days, or even if that destination exists only in our imaginations. But when we do entertain ourselves with such ideas, we feel like we have taken a step to heal ourselves or to give our mind a worthy time out.\n\nOn the other hand, we have been living in human-focused settlements like cities for around 10,000 years, and we have all we need in an urban landscape, yet the idea of living in a secluded resort close to nature kept inviting us. This begs the question: were we supposed to live adjacent to nature to live well? Is it in our nature that we are wired to go back to the world beyond our doors? Or was it because we are aware of how big nature is, and how little time and resources we have to explore them all?\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Dec22",

The non-repetitive nature of the overlapping oscillations form the basis of a potentially endless experience. Four pre-synthesized waveforms spread across the soundstage have been arranged to highlight the emotional quality of the selected mode. Developed as part of the Forefront Web3 Creator Residency",

It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

Franke. \nhttps://www.tribute-hwf.com/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUndisputably, my mathematical background makes me naturally attracted to graphs, math functions, and transformations. I use math in ways that mathematicians could consider nonsense, but which produce fascinating aesthetic elements for creation (to paraphrase Herbert W. Franke). Combining scientific symbols and illustrations with fictional data produces pseudo-persuasive generative imagery that we can easily take to be absolute truth or in which we find meaningful patterns.\nIn the special issue of Leonardo, Visual Mathematics from 1992, Herbert W. Franke and Horst S. Helbig published the article Generative Mathematics: Mathematically Described and Calculated Visual Art.\n\nThey propose that “Through the use of [mathematical] formulas (software) we gain generative principles. Beyond formal descriptions, we obtain guides for the construction of images. For example, if we use a parametric representation of a curve, the result is similar to traditional methods of drawing and painting […]“ Additionally, mathematics removes frame limits and adds the possibilities for transitions, transformations, movement, and interaction by implementing simple changes to the defining parameters.\n\nI’m also very fond of the analysis and comparison (mentioned there) of digitally generated images and Constructivist design. Limitations of the technology (in the 70s) allowed only simple line drawings, based on fixed proportions same as Constructivists did. “In a short time, all possible features were exhausted, so it became an obvious goal to try to extend them. This was done first by the use of random generators — a highly interesting expansion of design principles […]” Another expansion happened by adding curved shapes, first simple then complex that overcame possibilities of drawing with compasses and rulers. “[…] oscillating curves are easily obtained through mathematical formulas and computer-graphic systems. The results we achieve on this basis do not look like Constructivist presentations, but their rationality and precision derive from Constructivist principles. ”\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nEach mint contains both dark and light version, use D/N keys to switch between “day & night”.\n \nBase shapes are circles or Lissajous curves modified by the noise function. Shapes are arranged in a grid or by a circle packing algorithm. Lines are drawn smoothly or in stripes. Around 20% of the mints have lines in only one color (black/white). \n\nDepending on the browser/configuration rendering times will vary. \n",

Link at the bottom. If you’d rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

            "description": "The initial spark for this piece started with Armin Hofmann’s exercises in style and composition. Just as George Nelson wrote in the preface to Armin’s book Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practices: \"Despite all our efforts to simplify things - efforts constantly expanding in order to keep abreast of steadily increasing complexity - nothing is very simple anymore\", these explorations just opened doors to other issues, and further grounded the idea that \"if problems can be correctly stated, they can be solved.\"\n\nArmin suggests we go back to the beginning, to concern ourselves with dots and circles and lines and then bring opposed components in confrontation. \"Confrontation is a theme on which variations can be played with any desired consonances, with any imaginable values, and in a great variety of ways. [...] (Only then) (s)he will be able to find creative solutions to the problems presented by the confrontation of opposites.\"\n\nVery quickly opposed components, even with extending the angle of vision from the two-dimensional surface to the three-dimensional space, and with the contrasts of thin-thick, solid-transparent, softened-hardened line, etc., started looking like I’m weaving complicated plots, visually similar to textile works by  Bauhaus women - Gunta Stölzl, Anni Albers, Gertrud Preiswerk and others.\n\nWhen Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919, he proclaimed that “every eligible person whose talent and training are considered adequate will be accepted without regard to age and sex.” However, in practice, discriminatory gender roles were reinforced, and female students were guided and advised to work with textiles rather than in workshops for heavy crafts such as carpentry. Despite that, Gropius’s “women’s section” became one of its most collaborative and brave experimental sectors. \n\nA hundred years later, it is disappointing to see we still carry on with inherited gender roles. Check the number of female computer science students in your country. How are things going \"at the intersection of arts and technology\"? I've implemented some of the percentages from Serbia in the distribution of shapes in the final compositions. I sampled the number of female vs. male students at the Faculty of Mathematics and the University of Arts (where I studied and now work), and gender distribution among graduated students, and it didn't look bad at all. But then I realized I'm the only female professor (out of 5) teaching main subjects at doctoral studies program in digital arts.\n\n\"When a group is underrepresented, people come to take that underrepresentation as the norm.\" Since representation is imperative to achieving equality, it is equally critical to change the biases we’ve developed over centuries.\n\nFor the title, I chose a dated version of the word for a female weaver on purpose. My native language is one of the Slavic languages, which are all gender sensitive. It is natural to have feminitives, but since historically some occupations were less (or not at all) practiced by women, many of the feminitives for those professions, jobs, and specializations are rarely used or don't exist in the dictionary. Also, not surprisingly, the dominant version of the noun describing a person who weaves in Serbian would be the female noun \"tkalja\", whereas the male version is so rare that is missing from some dictionaries. Conscientiously choosing the female version of the noun for the title, I position myself and this piece in the historical context with Bauhaus weveresses, contemporary language, and gender contexts, and finally in the curatorial context of the exhibition. \n\nCode Weaveresses is part of the FEMGEN exhibition curated by Micol Ap @verticalcrypoto in partnership with @RtClick_Save and @artblocks_io.\n",

This piece reflects on both phenomena, and uses sound waves as the point of origin for the visual interpretation. The non-repetitive nature of the overlapping oscillations form the basis of a potentially endless experience. Four pre-synthesized waveforms spread across the soundstage have been arranged to highlight the emotional quality of the selected mode. Developed as part of the Forefront Web3 Creator Residency",
