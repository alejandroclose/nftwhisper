            "description": "Unique iteration of the first Generative Token minted on fxhash.\n\nIt also servers as the actual logo of the platform. It represents the generative processes driving fxhash tokens. Generative Tokens are fed with a unique hash to produce unique outputs based on the hash — they are functions with a hash as single input.\n\nThe growth that comes out of the text is driven by a \"Dividing-Aggregating Walkers\" (DAW) algorithm. The hash drives all the DAW settings, as well as a mutation factor which is responsible for changes in each Walker parameters as they divide.\n\nSome iterations will produce very simple outputs whereas others might be more chaotic.\n\nPiece by @ciphrd for fxhash",

            "description": "Tumble Down Light Factory is an interpretation of light installations & murals.\n\nIt attempts to trigger the feeling of coming up on a new block in a new city to discover an unexpected piece of art that is stories tall or entering a new room, knowing there will be a projection dominating the space with its light and color.\n\nThis is an abstract distillation of those things and those feelings.\n\nEach composition is initially drawn to a hidden “template” canvas which is sampled and then rendered on the main canvas in various ways after applying some transforms to give it some depth (and so you can actually see it.)\n\nViewing in full-screen is nice. You should try it.\n\nT : Save hidden ‘template’ image\nS : Save current resolution\n1 -> 5 : Save low -> high resolution\n",

Especially useful on the palettes using outlines.\n- Export a PNG capture at various resolutions by pressing the number keys 1 to 9 (top row or numpad, and only in live mode, after pressing \"open\"). Resolutions ranges from 720 to 7680 pixels. I recommend starting with \"4\".\n\nGPU recommended. Best performances on Chrome in general.\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "A visual representation of a non-linear transformation. Each line connects a data point before the transformation has been applied to its corresponding point after the transformation has been applied. Switch to debug mode to see the untransformed and transformed points. Outline mode shows only the lines and can be used for plotting. (Plotting will likely work best on outputs where the total number of lines is low.)\n\nThe generative code is written in plain JavaScript, with the compute-intensive transformation (t-SNE) implemented in AssemblyScript and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for maximum performance. The final artwork is a static SVG file that can be downloaded and displayed at any resolution. No external libraries have been used.\n\nMore information about this collection is provided here: https://clauswilke.com/art/project/before-after\n\nI would like to thank Bartholomew Littlesilver for helpful artistic feedback, Liam Egan for help with creating plottable SVGs, and BRUTALISTI and neophob for encouraging me to pursue AssemblyScript for implementing performance-critical code.\n\nPress 'm' to cycle between normal, debug, and outline mode.\n\nPress 's' to save as svg.\n\nPress 'p' to save as png.\n\nAuthor:\nClaus O.

In it, I set up a small space in which a particle system can play, bouncing off obstacles, creating rivers and falls, and responding to various physical constraints.\n\nIt is created using a webgl pipeline consisting of, primarily, a GPGPU particle system consisting of 16k particles in motion in real-time. The physics simulation is made possible using a compute shader (not really compute, given webgl, but you get the idea) which records the particles' position, velocity, age, and data to a texture for use by the point program. Each particle is rendered as a semi-transparent radial gradient, adding up to a distance field that is used to render the liquid.\n\nLicensing: CC-BY-NC-ND see LICENCE.md for details",
