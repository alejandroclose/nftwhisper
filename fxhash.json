            "description": "The first installment of the Self trilogy.\n\nId is defined as: the one of the three divisions of the psyche in psychoanalytic theory that is completely unconscious and is the source of psychic energy derived from instinctual needs and drives.\n\nPlease see attached fx(text) article or go to https://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy for more on concept/mechanics/etc. It’s a bit of long read, but worth it.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

The tip of the triangle is the uterus which makes the space grow.\n-- LIA DREI (Diaries, 2004)\n\nMy paintings have no past, they are empty of meaning in the present, but await the discussions of the future, as remotely as possible.\nAnd this is why they don't have their feet firmly planted in the ground, although there are invisible roots that take life from the earth, like so many blades of grass.\nWhile I work I look for the truth in what I do. The time is not yesterday because it would be false, it is not today because the emotion takes my breath away and I die every moment and am reborn after every new brushstroke.\nSoon after, time becomes old, useless, meaningless. I never know what will come out with the next brushstroke or spatula stroke.\nMy thoughts go at supersonic speed and only stop to choose another color. The one just painted is never the right one. So I live the life of the new painting with the sense of mystery that the moonless night has. (…)\n-- LIA DREI (Notes, 1962)\n\n----\n\nI never talk about myself.\n\nI'm not creative.\nI blatantly steal other people's art.\nI'm a bad coder, I copy, paste, mix ideas.\nI often ruin it, degrade it.\nBut I always make it mine what I like.\n\nI absorb.\n\n-- ALESSANDRO FIORE (fxhash, 2024)\n\n\n—————\n\nThe work is created responsive by default and it will adapt to the browser window.

            "description": "This project was started in December 2021. At that time, I didn't know what the result would be. It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

            "description": "RAUSCH is a series of generative artworks that explore imaginary digital architectures. \n\nThis series challenges traditional notions of architectural representation and raises important questions about the role of resolution in design. Just as the pixel resolution of an image affects its perceived quality, the resolution of an architectural space can affect its qualities and livability. By embracing digital variation through codes, this series explores the interplay between abstract and concrete space through multiple resolutions. \n\nRAUSCH is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by complex, chaotic and messy sensations, and aims to engage the viewer through a sense of wonder, disorientation, and awe.\n\nReleased on the occasion of Companions of Code, a group exhibition by VerticalCrypto Art at The NFT Gallery in London. \nCurated by Micol Ap. Exhibition 10-24 February 2023 \n\n___________________________________________________\nRAUSCH Controls:\n\nAnimation: \n• ‘1 - 2 - 3 - 4’ animate views\n• 'MouseClick' pause/play animation\n\nFunctions:\n(press key & wait)\n• 'F' 24 FPS\n• 'B' b/w mode \n\nResize Canvas:\n(press key & wait)\n• '6' Portrait A4 - 1000x1414\n• '7' Landscape 16:9 - 1920x1080\n• '8' Portrait 9:16 - 1080x1920\n• '9' Square 1:1 - 1024x1024\n• 'DoubleClick' Fullscreen\n\nSave & Export Image:\n• 'S' save a .png of in current resolution\n\nSave & Export GIF:\n• 'G' save a 1-2 sec. seamless loop .gif of current view \n• 'P' save a 12-24 sec. seamless loop .gif of all the views\n• 'T’ scale down current resolution, save a 12 sec. seamless loop .gif\n\nSteps to save a gif/png :\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• resize canvas with 6,7,8, or 9 to your desired aspect ratio (wait)\n• press S,G or P to save & download (wait) \n• enjoy RAUSCH :)\n\nSave & Export GIF for social media sharing:\n• go in live/open mode (wait)\n• press T or G wait for recalculation & download. \n• enjoy RAUSCH \n• post on Twitter ;)\n__________________________________________________\n\nThis token may not work on mobile(!), but it allows exporting .png and .gif (see controls) to enjoy RAUSCH on different displays or mobile.

            "description": "*\\_../*`¬-’\\/*`¬’’¬`*\\/’-¬`*\\.._/*\n\nNature, nature, evolving might… Silent inventor, always right.\nWhere is the edge of nature and where do we begin?  \nWhat is of nature and what is of man? \nIsn't everything made by nature's hands?\n\nTo know more about the concept and technicalities of this piece, see the fxtext article “The spectrum of nature - a short making of”. Link at the bottom. If you’d rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.
