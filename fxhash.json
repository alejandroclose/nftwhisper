This is because I have become more rebellious against the artworks on the market, and I wanted to \"reconstruct\" them in my own interpretation.\n\nThe word \"ill\" also has the meaning of \"disease”. I found myself becoming more and more absorbed in this field as I created my own generative art. I would spend hours agonizing over an idea, and then I would devote myself to it for days until I was satisfied with my work! I can only think of this as a disease influenced by \"madness”!\n\nIt is a wonderful thing to be so absorbed in something!\n\nNow, this is my first piece of generative art.\nI programmed the coordinates of the rect to overlap different nearby rects, creating a gentle spiral from the center to the outside, which is the unique feature of this work.\n\nIt may be a poor work for you, but I am happy to share the \"madness\" of this generative art with you!\nLet's continue to enjoy the generative art with us!\n\nSora Kuramochi",

            "description": "This is a sentences generator made with js and html, text generated with gpt model code-cushman-001.\n \n\nChatGpt text:\n\n\"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" is an artwork born out of the unique intersection of human creativity and artificial intelligence. The brainchild of a collaborative endeavor between the artist and an AI model, this digital piece pays homage to Sol LeWitt's influential \"Sentences on Conceptual Art,\" while recontextualizing it within our increasingly digital world.\n\nThrough the medium of generative text, this piece contemplates the relationship between art, technology, and the human experience. It scrutinizes how digital tools have the potential to redefine artistic expression, how technology can help overcome the daunting 'blank canvas,' and the changing role of artists in this digital age.\n\nThe work views the internet as a boundless platform for global connection and observation, and discusses how AI's interpretive capacities can transform our understanding and appreciation of art. \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" envisions and champions the creation of new forms of artistic appreciation, facilitated by the adaptive and collaborative nature of digital media.\n\nAdding a layer of interactivity and intrigue, the artwork censors some segments of its generated sentences with black strikethroughs, provoking personal interpretation, discovery, and a deeper level of engagement from the viewer.\n\nIn essence, \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" presents a thoughtful exploration of the dynamic and evolving landscape of art in the digital age. As a testament to the transformative potential of human creativity blended with machine intelligence, this work reimagines the possibilities of what art can be and underscores the profound impact of digital tools and methodologies on our perception and experience of art. It invites us all to partake in the discourse on the symbiotic future of creativity and technology.\n\n＼_ﾍ(ω｀●)\n\nHans Ulrich Obrist, curator and art historian: \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" is a pivotal work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and art. The combination of human creativity with machine learning results in a provocative exploration of the contemporary artistic landscape. This work questions, and in doing so, extends the boundaries of what we understand as art.\"\n\nOlafur Eliasson, artist: \"The artist's use of AI to generate 'sentences of digital art' reveals a deep understanding of the ongoing dialogue between humanity and technology. This piece echoes the beauty of our ever-evolving interaction with the digital realm.\"\n\nLev Manovich, author and theorist of digital culture: \"The work is a fascinating embodiment of software as a medium of creation. It captures the dialectical tension between control and automation, intention and serendipity, that characterizes digital art in the era of artificial intelligence.\"\n\nCecilia Alemani, curator and director: \"The collaboration between the artist and AI in 'IA Sentences on Digital Art' redefines the concept of artistic creation. It's a testament to the transformative potential of digital technologies in shaping the future of art.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncanekzapata.net\n\njs css html txt\n1.8mb\n2023\n",

As machines enter into our societies - our ecologies - we may think what would be like a society of machines only. What are portraits of said machines without us humans around? Will they want to seek for their individual character, much like we do? It will depend on their personalities, their will, their intent, their traumas... their versions of all of this. We shall need to understand what their motivations will be like - what the potential basis for their potential version of a potential conscience is and how it will evolve. Only through a good understanding of diversity can we reach a functioning system. Both for ecologies with machines as well as ecologies without.\n\necologías-C is an entity that is part of a broader ecology. Released on occasion of the show \"Unbound - Ecology in the Age of Machines\" at Unit London.

            "description": "Chess is a game of choreography: both the external choreography of pieces moving across a board, and the internal choreography of the players themselves determining which moves to make. In this work, I explore the nexus of both of these movements.\n\nI took a photograph of a chess board as the Pacific Ocean washed over it. Over this board, I have projected historic games of chess in textual form. Each square represents a narrative, of each piece as it moved, and various potential moves suggested by the Stockfish chess engine at every step in time.\n\nEach edition of this gentk is a single game of chess, one of 82 possible historic games, either from the perspective of the white or the black side. The games span five and a half centuries, though most are from the 19th and 20th centuries due to availability of data. A variety of colors illustrate potential moves (and outcomes, predicted by the Stockfish engine) as well as the actual moves made, in turn. \n\nI am providing 64 editions of this gentk: one for each square on the board. This work is fully responsive and will scale to any resolution, although due to the density of its text, I believe it looks best on a 4K (or higher) display. The code is vanilla JavaScript with zero dependencies.\n\nThank you for collecting. Please enjoy.",

Using distinct minimalist components, the algorithm patterns, contorts, and intertwines geometries to reveal rich and vital maximalist compositions. The explorations of Risonanza revels in the quirks that emerge through this process, seemingly with spontaneity. They invite us to identify and savor the underlying simplicity of a common language that resides amidst all manners of imperfections, randomness, and intricate complexities we perceive around us.\n\nEmbodying the equilibrium between simplicity and intricacy, these works represent the dance between the innate harmony of existence and life's unknown paths. This balance of forces provides a simple and joyful invitation to attune to the energetic, complex, and singular harmonious essence of each work of art – an embodiment of the eternal resonance that courses through the universe.\n\n\n—————\n\nTENDER x whitekross\nSeptember 2023\n\nRisonanza is Italian for Resonance, and is a generative art series created by Alessandro Fiore (AKA whitekross) in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n—————\n\n\nKey commands:\n\n1 = 2000x3000\n2 = 4000x6000\n3 = 6000x9000 (Dependent on your browser limitations, tested on Safari (Mac))\ns = Save at current resolution\n\n\nLicense:\n\nSee LICENSE.md in live view for details.",

            "description": "Tendencies is the first in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art in the 1970s.\n\nZajec's generative work was motivated by redundancy in his paintings: \"The monotony of the manual task and the limited number of variations which I was able to produce in a given time made me realize the inadequacy of traditional methods in dealing with our present reality.\" Tendencies was inspired by — and pays tribute to — one if Zajec's earliest forays into generative creation: a work titled RAM 10 V.15, which was written on an IBM 1620 and programmed in FORTRAN.\n\nThe title of the collection itself is a reference to the first exhibition of Zajec's RAM series, while the number of editions minted referencing the year Zajec put plotter to paper.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated December 2022\nBy @christine_hall\n",

            "description": "There is a place in a remote village with only forest and huge meadows and hills around it. I used to spend a few days there in the summer. This year it has become my retreat for the whole summer. There is silence around and no persistent explosions from the bombing. I wanted to use this time to relax and reflect.\n\nWhen I began working on the project, I had no specific goals in my mind. I didn't set myself any tasks, didn't commit to any deadlines. Suddenly, I found something that reminded me of blooming meadows, it was in tune with my state at that moment. So I started to develop this theme. I did not aim to turn it into a realistic picture. The images were supposed to remain abstract, just to convey the general mood and impressions I was feeling.\n \nInitially, it was a story about summer meadows and grasses. But in the process, I had memories of impressions that arose in different seasons, which I observed in nature here. Colour became the main conductor of the story about various states of nature. It is common to see a lot of black soil in spring through which fresh shoots break through, creating bright splashes on a dark background. During the early summer, the area is covered in lush grasses and wildflowers, as well as butterflies. The world blooms and life is reborn. Eventually, the grasses wither due to the hot sun. Sun-burnt straw sheaves take on a special beauty and texture.  As autumn approaches, we turn to the terracotta range, which offers a variety of ripe mature flowers. Winter is all about graphics. During this period, I usually like to take black and white pictures. Every time, every state of nature has its own beauty. As well as every period of our life.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nPlease pay attention: for rendering the project you might need a rather powerful CPU. Depending on your equipment, it may take several seconds to several minutes for the process to complete. \n\nThe project was tested on different browsers; it works best in Chrome. Please make sure the project works on your device.\n\nPlease be aware, if you are minting with Safari or Firefox for Mac, a live preview image may differ slightly from a captured image.\n\nThe final resolution of the saved output depends on the size of your browser window. \n\nTo save a high resolution image add &scale=(and then a number from 4 to 12) to the end of the URL when in live mode. For example, &scale=6. \n\nPress ’s’ to save the image.\n\nTo save an output with a density higher than 9 (or resolution more than 4319x7680) use Firefox for PC or Safari for Mac. Please be aware that it might take more time to generate a higher density output even on a powerful computer, so please be patient.\n\n\n|||||\n\n\nOlga Fradina (Live Minting Experience at Unit London), 2023\nMade with p5.js and GLSL.\n\n\n",
