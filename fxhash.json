This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory. Like a child you never forget. I submit to you again in new media for you all to enjoy.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "At the heart of the borders of imagination stands my creation, \"Fata Morgana.\" \nThis abstract work is a bold exploration of the boundaries between reality and dream, a subtle dance between dimensions of perception. \nI forged this vision by giving life to a structure that eludes the human eye like a mirage in a scorching desert.\n\nFrom a distance, this creation draws the observer into a world that merges and blends with reality. The structures emerge as promises of urban architecture, but as they approach, they crumble into patterns of light and color.\n\nColors harmoniously dance, gently fading through ethereal shades. The forms themselves seem to reject definition, refusing to adhere to the laws of perspective and geometry.\n\nThe backdrop of this illusory city is a palette of chromatic emotions. Here, the boundary between the real and unreal completely dissolves, and one finds themselves wandering in a limbo of perceptions, suspended between certainty and wonder.\n\nThe artwork is an invitation to explore the unknown, a celebration of the art of illusion. It is a place where the rules of physics give way to the uninterrupted dance of creativity. In this abstract vision, I hope that everyone can find their own interpretation, a personal meaning that reveals itself like a secret guarded among the nuances of light and shadow.\n\nTo change the density from 1 to 5 (incorrect results set to 1), double-click the left mouse button,\npress S to delete background.\n\nI used p5.min.js - p5.sound.js.",

            "description": "At the heart of the borders of imagination stands my creation, \"Fata Morgana.\" \nThis abstract work is a bold exploration of the boundaries between reality and dream, a subtle dance between dimensions of perception. \nI forged this vision by giving life to a structure that eludes the human eye like a mirage in a scorching desert.\n\nFrom a distance, this creation draws the observer into a world that merges and blends with reality. The structures emerge as promises of urban architecture, but as they approach, they crumble into patterns of light and color.\n\nColors harmoniously dance, gently fading through ethereal shades. The forms themselves seem to reject definition, refusing to adhere to the laws of perspective and geometry.\n\nThe backdrop of this illusory city is a palette of chromatic emotions. Here, the boundary between the real and unreal completely dissolves, and one finds themselves wandering in a limbo of perceptions, suspended between certainty and wonder.\n\nThe artwork is an invitation to explore the unknown, a celebration of the art of illusion. It is a place where the rules of physics give way to the uninterrupted dance of creativity. In this abstract vision, I hope that everyone can find their own interpretation, a personal meaning that reveals itself like a secret guarded among the nuances of light and shadow.\n\nTo change the density from 1 to 5 (incorrect results set to 1), double-click the left mouse button,\npress S to delete background.\n\nI used p5.min.js - p5.sound.js.",

Morellet was one of the founders of the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), founded in the 60s. His work was often informed by systems, a set of rules that determine the artwork, reducing the artist's subjectivity to a minimum.\n\nThis work explores what happens when we let go of the strict rule set. Do we ever fully let go?\n\n-----------------\nThis work was released for the 2023 fundraising exhibition Cure3, and all of the proceeds and 1% of royalties will go to Parkinson's research funds.

            "description": "Comfort. Annoyance. Pity. Surprise. Boredom. Elation. Our emotions are reactions to events that echo the past. \n\nMuch of life is spent comparing present experiences with memories, and honing our ability to recognize the patterns and choices that shape us. We use this awareness and feedback to navigate our world with efficiency, simplicity, and the many resulting habits – both positive and negative. These cycles can result in mounting achievements or familiar pitfalls, but whatever they manifest, they are ceaseless and everywhere. From the repetitive cycles of birth and death, to the familiar behaviors and encounters of daily life, we are reminded that the past informs our current actions – and perpetuates a related future in what's known as \"the eternal return.\"\n\n\"Rückkopplung\" translates from German as \"feedback,\" and refers to the process wherein a system's output affects its input – creating a loop of influence that guides self-regulation and adaptation. When applied to the realm of human behavior, this feedback mechanism both reinforces the occurrence of patterns, and empowers us to evolve what is returned from the past. In creative systems, these loops of learning steer the subsequent step towards either harmony or chaos, minute recurring patterns or sweeping impressive strokes. The hues may converge into somber depths of melancholy, or interpose and layer with vibrant optimism. While we cannot predict what any piece of Rückkopplung will look like, its identity becomes unmistakably recognizable upon viewing.\n\nIn observing how these recurring loops generate an extensive array of outcomes, yet remain undeniably familiar, we find ourselves unshackled to appreciate the diversity and unity of life, and profoundly immersed in the Art of each present moment.\n\n/////\n\nTENDER x pxlshrd\nAugust 2023\n\nRückkopplung is a generative art series created by pxlshrd in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n/////\n\nKey commands:\n1 = 6K with texture & margin\n2 = 6K w/o texture & margin\n8 = 12K with texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n9 = 12K w/o texture & margin (Safari on Mac only)\n0 = Default aspect ratio/resolution\n\nf = Adaptive mode (fullscreen)\nh = Adaptive mode high resolution w/o texture & margin\nw = Phone wallpaper\n\nj = jpeg current resolution\np = png current resolution\n\nMobile: Tap and hold the image for 2 seconds to save a jpg.\n\n/////\n\nFor the 12K export, proper rendering is only ensured when using Safari on Mac.

            "description": "Superimposed Rectangles\n\nThis is the fifth in series of works where we pay homage to Ken Knowlton, scientist and computer graphic pioneer and artist who passed on June 16, 2022. Ken Knowlton developed the famous EXPLOR language, (Explicit 2-D Patterns, Local Operations, and Randomness) while at Bell Labs. He published a paper describing it in 1975 entitled: MINI-EXPLOR, A FORTRAN-Coded Version of the EXPLOR Language for Mini (and larger) Computers. (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/988049.988052)\n\nSuperimposed Rectangles is my variation of one of Knowlton’s test examples: Contour Plot of Superimposed Octagonal Pyramids (Example 3). As Christopher Scussel continues to revamp the EXPLOR engine I endeavor to understand its capabilities as an aesthetic tool.\n\nThe inherent qualities of an original EXPLOR image is it is low resolution and uses a 4 gray scale color palette. When it was used in the 1970’s images were often generated this way as a series of frames then recorded on film and manipulated in post production. In this image we use a higher resolution (250x250) and employ 3x3 “blocks” of pixels instead of alphanumeric character combinations that we can render in 24bit color. \n\nTHE EXPLOR language consists of a set of functions that manipulate the contents of an internal array. Each element in internal display memory maps into a block in the output image. The CHANJ() function places rectangular areas of blocks over previously drawn sections in internal memory and more important, it applies rules that look at the current state of a particular array element and applies a rule to change that element. The trick is how to make this visually interesting.\n\nI employ a grid structure to distribute a rectangular widget across the picture plane. The widget is a randomly defined area that grows in a random direction based on a set of random variables. During each iteration the new area overwrites internal memory (following a set  of rules). I think this variation looks and feels like Knowlton’s Example 3 and maintains the EXPLOR vibe. The rectangles interact to form dimensional depth and an architectural quality.\n\nWe continue to honor the passing of Ken Knowlton with this NFT series. Here is an opportunity to collect an example image from the famous program he authored now updated by Scussel and Kolomyjec. A true piece of Computer Graphic Art history with a modern twist.\n\n(c)2022 Dr. Bill Kolomyjec and Christoper Scussel. All rights reserved.",
