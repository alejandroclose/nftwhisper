            "description": "This project is about my mother's lifestyle. Her work is breeding and herding goats, cows and horses.\nShe lives a cyclical life marked by two major stages during her livestock year: \"La Veranada\" and \"La Invernada\". My last work was about \"La Veranada\", this work is about \"La Invernada\", I hope you enjoy it.\nTime in the life of a criancero is cyclical. Everything comes and goes, and comes back and comes back. Nature, so present, so in connection with the man and woman who inhabit it, marks the times perhaps like no other place.\n The succession of the seasons, the weather, the buds and \"La Invernada\", the sowing, the pastures, the harvest and the snows.\n\"La Invernada\" is the place during what we could call the long winter, that is, from April to November.\n\"La Invernada\" is down in the plains, in the pampas, in accessible places, where it is easy to supply forage to the goats that calve between October and November.\nThe \"Criancero\" rides a horse every day and, accompanied by his dogs, goes to \"watch\" the goats. They distinguish them in the distance. Every day is the same and different at the same time. Caring for, watching over and keeping the goats healthy and safe.\n\"El puesto\" is their home. In the stall they use the water from the river, which they draw with a water pump, for their hygiene. Water for consumption is brought in jerry cans from \"Vertientes\", located about 10 km away.\n The hens roam freely throughout the day, when night comes some go to sleep in the \"gallinero\" and others simply sleep on small plants.\nAs you can see, life here is simple, solitary and with a lot of work.\nI want to thank all those who have taken the trouble to read the story. I hope you liked it.\nYou can find real photos and videos of \"La Invernada\" on my twitter profile.\n\nFeatures:\n10 Color Palettes.\n10 types of Animal pen.\nVarious types of chickens.\n14 types of herbs.\n10 types of flowerpot.\n4 types of trees.\n7 types of rivers.\nThe barn has 4 sizes.\nThe moon has a very varied range of x and y positions.\n6% chance of getting snowy weather in the piece.\n\n\nPress \"S\" in live mode to save the 2600 x 3000 image.\nNote that the algorithm may take some time to run.\nCreated by Fernando.

After a few iterations, masks began to emerge. I added a mirroring effect to enhance the visual and added eyes for added realism. The end result is a series of intriguing masks, created through the use of randomness and artistic experimentation.\n\nTo save your canvas, simply press S.\n\nFor more information and to stay up to date with my work, follow me on Twitter at @lomzart or visit my portfolio website at lomz.net.

            "description": "This is an algorithmic tribute to the pioneering work of Anna Atkins (1799-1871). Considered by many the first female photographer, Atkins learned about the cyanotype process soon after it was invented by John Herschel, a family friend. As a botanist, she had the idea of using the new technique to produce contact prints of plants. Her investigations succeeded in capturing the nuances in morphology and the delicate details of many species.\n\nIn 1843 she published “British Algae: Cyanotype impressions”, the first published book to use a photographic process for the illustrations. Each copy gathered around 400 prints, each of them individually produced from a different specimen. Thus, all books featured the same species, but each of them was different, in a process that was itself generative in a certain way. Today, about 17 copies of the book are preserved in different institutions. Atkins went on to publish two more books in the following years, with the help of her friend Anne Dixon, dedicated to various ferns and plants.\n\n“Cyanotypes” pays homage to her wonderful work, which sits at the intersection between science and art, and used technology in a novel way to capture the beauty of nature. Here things are taken one step forward, to generate algorithmic simulations of plants, ferns, and algae, which are the work of fantasy and not necessarily faithful to the traits of any real species.\n\nThe work features 28 basic configurations, each of them in turn capable of unlimited variations. As was the case with the prints from “British Algae”, every image is at the same time part of a series and unique. \n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 800 x 1000 resolution. Please note that rendering at high resolutions can be very slow.\n\nMade with p5.js. \n",

If we are visibly surrounded by walls with flooring under, a ceiling above, and a window facing the sky, we know we are inside of an enclosed space, with a view of outside. But how does a room stopped being an enclosed space? Can a space with 3 walls be considered a room? If we are surrounded by walls but our ceiling is gone, then are we inside or outside? This is an exploration on the edges of our ability to perceive space. The fringes that instill some fear in our mind. And that fear is failing to make sense of our position in a space that slowly loses its tangibility.\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Jan23",

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",
