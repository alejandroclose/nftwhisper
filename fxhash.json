            "description": "This project was started in December 2021. At that time, I didn't know what the result would be. It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

            "description": "This generative artwork is a stunning example of how creativity and technology can merge to produce something truly unique. Its abstract nature and complex layering of shapes and colors evoke the work of celebrated artists like Wassily Kandinsky.\n\nAt first glance, it may seem like the work of an experienced human artist, but upon closer inspection, the subtle imperfections and intricacies reveal the influence of randomness and generative algorithms. The organic curves and bold strokes of the brush demonstrate a balance between the human touch and the unpredictable output of the program.\n\nThis artwork has the power to elicit a range of emotions and interpretations from the viewer. Its abstract nature allows for personal interpretation, which is a hallmark of great art. It's an excellent example of how technology and creativity can work together to create something beautiful and thought-provoking.\n\nIn essence, this artwork reminds us of the endless possibilities that can be achieved through the integration of human creativity and the power of generative algorithms. It showcases the potential for new levels of artistic expression and innovation.",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

This one has a consistent gap between flow lines and a low noise resolution, producing a wispy effect that often looks like thread or felt.  Sometimes the background is a bit garish, which can be fun.  There's a good chance some texture will be added in the end, either mixing the colors and softening, or adding a fine paper texture.  It finishes off with a grain shader by Dave Pegurek found here: https://editor.p5js.org/davepagurek/sketches/m6p09ERHx\n\nAfter opening, hit 2 - 5 for higher pixel densities, and 's' to save a png. Resizing the canvas reverts to pixel density 1.\n\nCome visit my YouTube channel for generative art how-to videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjYUJudUW67Tg79jtF_rpQ",

Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present.

            "description": "In Flow is the first in a series of four projects exploring flow fields, produced with 100% code in p5.js.  This one has a consistent gap between flow lines and a low noise resolution, producing a wispy effect that often looks like thread or felt.  Sometimes the background is a bit garish, which can be fun.  There's a good chance some texture will be added in the end, either mixing the colors and softening, or adding a fine paper texture.  It finishes off with a grain shader by Dave Pegurek found here: https://editor.p5js.org/davepagurek/sketches/m6p09ERHx\n\nAfter opening, hit 2 - 5 for higher pixel densities, and 's' to save a png. Resizing the canvas reverts to pixel density 1.\n\nCome visit my YouTube channel for generative art how-to videos: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjYUJudUW67Tg79jtF_rpQ",

            "description": "At length, I summoned the courage to approach.\n\n-\n\nI was worn. Months of aimless wandering have culminated in this series; a meditation on my struggles to find a direction in my life and with my art.\n\nAt times paralyzed by too many possibilities, and at other times completely void of ideas. I was lost in the depths of my thinking, overwhelmed by indecision and doubt.\n\nGenerative works are a form of process art, yet along the way I’d forgotten to “trust the process”. It was time to cede control and let each line of code light the way.\n\n-\n\nThis project paints on a 2D canvas, pixel by pixel. I used a custom projection that blends isometric and perspective techniques, to create an uncanny viewpoint between the two. Objects are randomly generated, then an algorithm applies color mixing and position displacement to each pixel as it’s rendered.\n\nBy default the canvas has 2k pixels on its longest edge. You can change this in live view by pressing any number from 1-9. For example, pressing ‘4’ would render it with 4k pixels along the longest edge. I recommend ‘4’, but this can take up to a few minutes to render.\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the rendered image.",
