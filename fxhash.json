            "description": "Diamond Fractal Fire interposes recursively generated poetry with similarly recursive fractal imagery. Each text (unique for each mint, but always 20 sentences in length) is generated by a custom context-free grammar algorithm, fed with lists of words selected by the creator. The fractal pattern in each edition is a variation on a Koch snowflake fractal, one of the earliest fractals described by mathematicians. These fractals grow over time at varying rates, and pulse with varying color ranges using Perlin noise, eventually filling the screen.\n\n\nPush `h` to save high resolution PNG and JPG images of the complete fractal pattern (takes a moment to process)\nPush `s` to save PNG and JPG images of the current browser view (with current browser window dimensions and resolution)\nPush `v` to begin recording canvas as a video (with current browser window dimensions), then push `v` again to save the video\nPush `f` to toggle fullscreen mode\nPush `p` to toggle zoom pause\nPush `r` to toggle zoom reverse\nPush `c` to toggle color shift pause\nPush `l` to toggle low resolution mode (improves framerate)\n\n\nThe animation is somewhat computationally expensive, and so it runs best on contemporary laptop and desktop computers. Mobile devices and older computers may experience low frame rates. Captured video quality may vary depending on compute and browser limitations. The animation is responsive (it will adapt to any screen or window size), and resizing your browser window also will restart the animation.\n\nColor floors and variances represent ranges for Hue using a Hue/Saturation/Brightness (HSB) color model. Velocities represent (subtle) zoom speed differences. Noise increment and start values affect the rate and variation of color shifts.\n\nIn addition to the author's code, Diamond Fractal Fire relies on the p5.js library.",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

Whether a commitment to a partner, community, or oneself – the longevity of a deeply held bond is often marked with a symbol of passing time, like knots tied in a rope.\n\nLet these ropes remind us of the binds we hold – new ones, lengthy ones, unbreakable ones, and even those we’ve had to untie. In plain view, these knots invite us to contemplate what our bonds mean to us, and to see them anew.\n\n---\n\nPress ‘1’-’9’ to increase resolution\nPress 's' to save an image of the output at the current resolution\n\nCreated with p5.js\nFor third party license information, please see license.md\n\n---\n\nTENDER x David Brice Allen\nJuly 2022",

Simply the algorithm takes a rectangle and throws 2 random points inside it within defined x and y distances. Then using those 2 points, algorithm draws another rectangle and assigns letters to the corners of rectangle \"A,B,C,D\" starting from top left corner in clockwise direction. Then it starts to draw cells from inner rectangle's corner A to parent's corner A and goes on. Once 4 cells are created, it creates 4 more cells in between other cells, thus dividing a rectangle into 9 pieces. This is where \"IX\" comes from. Depending on the cell properties; algorithm assigns circles, triangles, lines and points to cells creating a city scape when certain parameters are given to the division algorithm.\n\nThere are 18 possible outcomes:\n\"Hazy Day\" 13% probability (half of this style will come with slightly more color transition)\n\"Hazy Night\" 10% probability\n\"Crystal Day\" 11% probability\n\"Crystal Night\" 5% probability\n\"Mondrian Day\"  3% probability\n\"Mondrian Night\" 3% probability\n\"Bauhaus Day\" 3% probability\n\"Bauhaus Night\" 3% probability\n\"1 Chroma Day\" 4% probability (Multiple values of a single hue on a monochrome gradient)\n\"Mondrian Crystal Day\" 3% probability\n\"Mondrian Crystal Night\" 3% probability\n\"Monochrome Day\" 3% probability \n\"Monochrome Night\" 4% probability \n\"Vibrant Day\" 12% probability\n\"Vibrant Night\" 9% probability\n\"Rainbow Day' 5% probability\n\"Rainbow Night' 3% probability\n\"Chaotic Day\"   3% probability (which takes pretty random parameters and 25% of this outcome has probability of creating very first coloring style of the project, see console for the hidden feature)\n\n\n\n\nPress \"1\" to download 1000px height PNG\nPress \"2\" to download 2000px height PNG\nPress \"3\" to download 3000px height PNG\nPress \"4\" to download 4000px height PNG\nPress \"5\" to download 5000px height PNG\nPress \"6\" to download 6000px height PNG\nPress \"7\" to download 7000px height PNG\nPress \"8\" to download 8000px height PNG\nPress \"9\" to download 12000px height PNG\nPress \"m' to download 900x1600px PNG for mobile wallpaper\n\nUse CTRL+SHIFT+C or CMD+SHIFT+C to open console for hidden features\n\nCreated from scratch with p5.js \nMurat Atimtay 2022 | @atimtay | www.muratatimtay.com \n",

            "description": "In 1973 I was an instructor of Engineering Graphics in the College of Engineering at Michigan State University as well as a graduate student in Graphic Design. In the College of Engineering I was fortunate enough to meet Christopher Scussel, a fellow graduate student who was majoring in a new program called Computer Science. I was struggling using the earliest forms of computer equipment and the cumbersome programming language called FORTRAN to make make computer art. I asked Chris for help and he graciously consented. That began our amazing friendship that has lasted to this day.\n\nChris and I collaborated on a number of early pieces. He showed me how to formulate algorithms into code. He showed me how to program the primitive equipment of the time: line printers, storage scopes and pen plotters to make graphic output. We even built our own graphic output device, an 8 x 8 array of light bulbs. We were indeed pioneers.\n\nChris graduated in 1976 and has since retired after working 37 years as a research scientist at Bell Labs. I went on to get a Ph.D in 1981 and moved on with my life (see my story on (www.drbillkolomyjec.com). I started making generative art again in 2020. In true \"glory days\" spirit I tracked Chris down to see if he was interested in collaborating. Once again he graciously consented citing an opportunity for \"creative stimulation\", so here we go again. It is pure joy to be working with Chris again. \n\nAfter some initial back and forth I discovered that Chris has always been interested in generating algorithmic images of lines that do not cross. Maybe this has to do with our earlier collaborations of drawing black lines on a white background with a pen plotter. After several iterations Chris came up with the algorithm presented here. It is based on random vectors and linear interpolation that produces voluptuous, organic quality visual landscapes of non-crossing lines. I suggested a few tweaks along the way and the addition of color.\n\nThis piece represents the first \"published\" output of our renewed collaboration. \n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

These lines\ncan be either straight or curved.\n\nThe collection of inks and papers has also been expanded from 'this is where i draw the line'.
