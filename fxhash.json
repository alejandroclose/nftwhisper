            "description": "“Thébaïde” is a french word for wild place, remote and peaceful, where to live in a calm retreat. It's also simply a desert and a synonym of solitude. It comes from Thebaid, an arid region of ancient Egypt and Thebes was the capital.\n\n“thébaïde” is my debut on fx(hash), almost one year since my first works minted on Objkt (a series of Indian ink drawings, in January 2022). After learning the basics of creative coding recently, and a few works with this technique, I decided to create a first generative project. With \"thébaïde\" I chose to express the minimalist and narrative aspects of my artistic approach (though the title and concept emerged at the end). Gradually the work was resonating with philosophical matters I'm obsessed with since years: time, emptiness, human condition, erosion, desire, chance, combining them into a visual metaphor. The view of a vast area, a changing silhouette, an impenetrable monolith or an opening to elsewhere or nothing, day and night and day and night and dawn and dusk — few elements able to compose a meditative and lasting tableau of questions and feelings.\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work.\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 px x 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.com",

            "description": "WHISPERS (in code) is part of the fx(hash) interactive minting experience at Performance in Code: Deciphering Value in Generative Art, Art Basel Miami Beach, 2022. \nThe project is a collaborative performance between the viewer and AI. It reverses the usual approach of using AI as a tool to perform our intents (as in popular prompt-based AI methods) and gives the decision-making power to the AI, where we, humans, receive instructions on how to proceed in the creative process. Interaction happens in a multi-stage manner, in a metaphor for the process of training neural networks. At each step, after the user performs the action, they can send the image for evaluation by the neural network and receive another instruction (similarly to how networks learn by receiving feedback from the loss function).  What makes us different from the machines, however, is the presence of free will, and our ability to disobey the machine’s guidance. We are not restricted to its instructions and are free to interact with and break the artwork. \n\nArtwork is built on layers of photography, AI, GAN, diffusion, classification convolutional networks, random pixel manipulations, and user interaction. Like with most artist projects, it starts with a few memories, that are then re-imagined by GAN. The initial building blocks are a combination of photographs and AI outputs. The apparent lack of coherent subject choice in input images signifies how we build the perception of the world around us and apply an individual hierarchy to elements worth remembering. The blocks are then stripped of meaning by reducing them to abstract shapes and applying stochastic image transformations, guided by randomness. The neural network then learns to classify the images and outputs its best guesses on how to improve the pictures. \n \nThe goal of the project is to explore the controversial question of authorship through the use of tools incorporating AI. Does it lie with decisive or executive power? Here, the boundaries are blurred and one can no longer distinguish the clear author of a finished artwork - is it the artist, AI, serendipity, or viewer? \n\n\n- Use your mouse to perform machine instructions.\n- Use the \"E\" key to ask the neural network for instructions.\n- Use the \"R\" key to reset the drawing.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.\n",

            "description": "Simple shapes, when strewn broadly and systematically, suggest the presence of infinite creative possibilities and are capable of portraying a visceral excitement felt by mixing the energy of light with the contemplation of dark.\n\nThis exercise has been repeated for ages, and its relevance will remain for as long as light may meet dark. The silhouettes of Stonehenge battling against a bright sky, the wabi-sabi placement of rocks in a Japanese garden hugged by methodical raking, the play of shadows in Plato's Allegory of the Cave, and the playfully arranged cut-outs of collage or chemical photogram — these all attest to the unending dynamism of form when imbued with light and the contrast of its absence.\n\nAs absence and darkness are made visible, the trail of their path conveys a speed as fast as light, and dark shapes that are no less important than the brightest figures. A symbiotic coexistence of these forces was born with the universe – and a delicate balance remains between the powerful glare of light and the stealthy speed of dark.\n\nInspired by photograms and a little-known series by documentary photographer William Klein, Speed of Dark references the visual language of the darkroom and the history of photography as an underlying analog for how an emerging art medium can harness simple elements to create evocative expressions.\n\nChoose a resolution by adding \"&width=9000\" to the URL in live view.\nRemove the border by adding \"&noborder=1\" to the URL.\n\n__________\nTENDER x Laurent Houdard\nMay 2022\n",

            "description": "Tema is the second in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art in the 1970s.\n\nAfter gaining some traction with his original collection RAM, Zajec and his collaborating programmer Matjaz Hmeljak undertook a more complex algorithm titled \"The Cube: Theme and Variation\" (or TVC). The program laid out 8 unique elements in a grid, creating a three-dimensional viewing of objects in space. They published a paper about the underlying algorithm, found at: http://www.edwardzajec.com/tvc4/pil1/index.html\n\nTVC was first printed in 1971, shortly after Zajec returned to Italy following his artistic studies in the US. It was programmed on an IBM 9044 & printed with a CalComp 563 plotter.\n\nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to save a high-resolution version of the image\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nBy @christine_hall",

            "description": "In march of this year, I started working on a new series involving multi-layering, and overriding shapes. Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

            "description": "In march of this year, I started working on a new series involving multi-layering, and overriding shapes. Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

            "description": "This project is the culmination of many generative art experiments I have run throughout 2022. It relies heavily on the random walks through color and space techniques I have been working with, but also introduces other elements related to 2D and 3D rotation, framing and grains.\n\nContinuum began as an abstract composition made up of a set of interacting elements against a background. This is still true. However, in my own mind, I have come to consider many Continuum pieces as peculiar, stylized observations of massive futuristic spacial, or quantum, constructions. Maybe even involving a wormhole through the fabric of space-time for some civilization well past 1 on the Kardashev scale. At the center is an erratic crystalline form, which is fed by power trains, and all around is a massive multicolored rotating containment structure.\n\nAside from the standard, inverse, threshold and washed types, the most defining trait of each composition is the “Back Style” which relates to a point of construction, activity or deconstruction of these structures. This is further refined by the panel style, the panel density and the rotation level. The other traits largely relate to color variability and aesthetics. \n\nThis work has been coded using p5.js, and half of all royalties from the primary, and secondary, sales are assigned to the processing foundation.\n\nPress s to download a 2400x2400 pixel image.\n\nThis work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.\n",
