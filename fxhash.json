If we were Will’s baby, we’d be sitting up and prepping to crawl — the literal baby steps that precede an entire lifetime of movement. \n\nPlay is another integral part of our development. Play teaches us to connect, laugh, share, love, and learn. It helps form our earliest friendships that mold us into who we are destined to become. Over the last six months we have had the immense pleasure of forming new relationships with some of the amazing artists that comprise of the fxhash community. \n\nIt is the love and support of new friends Laurent Houdard, Ada Ada Ada, elsif, and Camille Roux that made our first (official) collaboration possible. Thank you so much for the idea, the vision, the art, the time, and the wrangling to make this possible. \n\nEach letter is imbued with the unique style of an artist, based on a framework created by Laurent. There is a small chance of receiving a piece with two of the same style, with the rarest possibility of receiving one with all four quadrants the same. \n\nCollect with love and the knowledge that your support means the world to us. Thank you for listening every week, and for the messages and stories that you share with us. We can’t wait to continue to grow.\n\nThank you so much again to Laurent, Ada, elsif, and Camille. This is what community is.",

            "description": "In 1973 I was an instructor of Engineering Graphics in the College of Engineering at Michigan State University as well as a graduate student in Graphic Design. In the College of Engineering I was fortunate enough to meet Christopher Scussel, a fellow graduate student who was majoring in a new program called Computer Science. I was struggling using the earliest forms of computer equipment and the cumbersome programming language called FORTRAN to make make computer art. I asked Chris for help and he graciously consented. That began our amazing friendship that has lasted to this day.\n\nChris and I collaborated on a number of early pieces. He showed me how to formulate algorithms into code. He showed me how to program the primitive equipment of the time: line printers, storage scopes and pen plotters to make graphic output. We even built our own graphic output device, an 8 x 8 array of light bulbs. We were indeed pioneers.\n\nChris graduated in 1976 and has since retired after working 37 years as a research scientist at Bell Labs. I went on to get a Ph.D in 1981 and moved on with my life (see my story on (www.drbillkolomyjec.com). I started making generative art again in 2020. In true \"glory days\" spirit I tracked Chris down to see if he was interested in collaborating. Once again he graciously consented citing an opportunity for \"creative stimulation\", so here we go again. It is pure joy to be working with Chris again. \n\nAfter some initial back and forth I discovered that Chris has always been interested in generating algorithmic images of lines that do not cross. Maybe this has to do with our earlier collaborations of drawing black lines on a white background with a pen plotter. After several iterations Chris came up with the algorithm presented here. It is based on random vectors and linear interpolation that produces voluptuous, organic quality visual landscapes of non-crossing lines. I suggested a few tweaks along the way and the addition of color.\n\nThis piece represents the first \"published\" output of our renewed collaboration. \n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

In the beginning, there were vague forms, these were the shards themselves, created in collaboration with Latent Diffusion. Over time, they have grown in detail, drawing their stories more clearly, thanks to Jax Diffusion.\n\nThe code that puts everything together was written by Yulikolay, for which he is greatly appreciated.",

If we were Will’s baby, we’d be sitting up and prepping to crawl — the literal baby steps that precede an entire lifetime of movement. \n\nPlay is another integral part of our development. Play teaches us to connect, laugh, share, love, and learn. It helps form our earliest friendships that mold us into who we are destined to become. Over the last six months we have had the immense pleasure of forming new relationships with some of the amazing artists that comprise of the fxhash community. \n\nIt is the love and support of new friends Laurent Houdard, Ada Ada Ada, elsif, and Camille Roux that made our first (official) collaboration possible. Thank you so much for the idea, the vision, the art, the time, and the wrangling to make this possible. \n\nEach letter is imbued with the unique style of an artist, based on a framework created by Laurent. There is a small chance of receiving a piece with two of the same style, with the rarest possibility of receiving one with all four quadrants the same. \n\nCollect with love and the knowledge that your support means the world to us. Thank you for listening every week, and for the messages and stories that you share with us. We can’t wait to continue to grow.\n\nThank you so much again to Laurent, Ada, elsif, and Camille. This is what community is.",

Both of the two hexagon colors are a random RGB value, at various luminosities.\n\nThe root of separation chooses which color takes the lead, between 1-100, 50 being evenly distributed.\n\nThe separation between the two colors can vary from 0-100, 0 is a 1% chance.\n\nModifiers can be either Circular or Hexagonal.\n\nThe scale of the hexagons on the grid varies from 1-100.\n\nThere is a 10% chance of a monochrome Esagoni, 5% respectively to both \"Black on White\" and \"White on Black.\"\n\n\nThis piece can also be changed to infinite resolutions, for any frame or screen you'd like to display it on.\n\nIn live view, press:\n\n'w' to view in 16:9\n\n't' to view in 8x10\n\n's' to view in 1x1\n\n'f' to adapt to your own screen size\n\nDouble-click to save image\n\nEnjoy :)",
