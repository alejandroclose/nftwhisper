            "description": "The preparations for the first mission began in 2142. It had become clear that mining petroleum on Earth would soon become financially unfeasible, so looking to other planets was the only logical choice. It took seventeen more years to perfect the technology so that the first colonists could reach Proxima b within the lifetime of one generation.\n\nAfter 45 years of travelling at almost one-tenth of the speed of light, they reached their new home. It was rich in petrochemicals but scarce in the nutrients necessary for long term human survival. After merely six generations, humanity was forced to travel once again in search of a new world. The four missions that parted from the Proxima system to colonise other possibly habitable planets in the galaxy sparked a new age of human civilisation that would never see itself united and thriving again.\n\nEventually, all the colonies became independent societies as their differing interests drove them apart. Each small civilisation chose its path, wandering the void of space alone. Over time, millions of kilometres apart, each colony developed its own culture and traditions. While their habits and customs changed, some things remained the same across all the societies, like how it became a certain tradition to convert the outer world years and days to Earth time and celebrate holidays according to the calendar of the old world.\n\nThe new nomads learned from the first pilgrims. They used the technology once optimised for oil extraction to traverse other worlds, searching for sustenance. Peculiar wandering nonspaces emerged from the involuntary degrowth of human civilisation.\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "Sol is a companion project that complements my recent series, Metamorphosis. Both projects share a common foundation - a cellular automata engine. The state of each cell in a new generation is influenced by its own state as well as those of its neighboring cells from the last generation. The rules guiding these state transitions, however, are dynamic.\n\nSol for me is an experimental plotter project. As a gesture of my gratitude to minters of Metamorphosis, all minters will be on the reserve list for a free piece of Sol. I’ll take a snapshot of Metamorphosis for the reserve list 30 minutes prior to Sol’s launch. For three days (unless all reserve-holders mint sooner), Sol will be only for those on the reserve list and I'll add anyone who purchases Metamorphosis on primary subsequently. After this period, any remaining pieces, along with an additional 50 mints, will be available for public sale.\n\nA Note on the Name: The inspiration behind the name 'Sol' springs from my visits to SF MoMA, where I always find myself in the space dedicated to Sol LeWitt. Through the repetition and variation of a singular concept, LeWitt constructed forms that were striking, often evolving from basic geometric forms into intricate structures. The same is also echoed in the principle of emergence in cellular automata, where complex systems arise from the interactions of simple components governed by rules. This series, Sol, is a homage to LeWitt's ingenuity in favoring dispassionate geometric forms over the emotionally-infused abstract art styles.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete svg file for plotting. To download three separate svg files with individual colors for plotting press 1,2 & 3. Running an optimization tool can help decrease the plotting time.\n\nPixel Love!\n",

Through the repetition and variation of a singular concept, LeWitt constructed forms that were striking, often evolving from basic geometric forms into intricate structures. The same is also echoed in the principle of emergence in cellular automata, where complex systems arise from the interactions of simple components governed by rules.

As a gesture of my gratitude to minters of Metamorphosis, all minters will be on the reserve list for a free piece of Sol. I’ll take a snapshot of Metamorphosis for the reserve list 30 minutes prior to Sol’s launch. For three days (unless all reserve-holders mint sooner), Sol will be only for those on the reserve list and I'll add anyone who purchases Metamorphosis on primary subsequently. After this period, any remaining pieces, along with an additional 50 mints, will be available for public sale.\n\nA Note on the Name: The inspiration behind the name 'Sol' springs from my visits to SF MoMA, where I always find myself in the space dedicated to Sol LeWitt. Through the repetition and variation of a singular concept, LeWitt constructed forms that were striking, often evolving from basic geometric forms into intricate structures. The same is also echoed in the principle of emergence in cellular automata, where complex systems arise from the interactions of simple components governed by rules. This series, Sol, is a homage to LeWitt's ingenuity in favoring dispassionate geometric forms over the emotionally-infused abstract art styles.\n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a png of the image in full screen.
