            "description": "\"Naïf\": An Introspection on Naivety\n\nFrom childhood, naivety is perceived as innate. It embodies a form of purity, an absence of experience that could have altered its original essence. In young adults or adults, especially in our productivity-focused societies, naivety is often seen as a weakness, a dysfunction, or even an exploitable incompetence, subject to mockery. As if the hardening process, deemed necessary to make an individual apt and conforming, had not operated satisfactorily.\n\nHowever, it is paradoxical to note that literature, as well as our personal experiences, are filled with examples where an adult's naivety is a strength, a means to overcome and transcend numerous obstacles. It's also a choice, conscious or unconscious, to apply a filter to the reality we observe and engage in.\n\nWith advanced age, there is often a return to this naivety, a rediscovery of that lost innocence. In the elderly, this quality becomes, in a way, normal and even desirable, especially when it doesn't stem from illnesses. It reflects a form of wisdom and resilience in the face of life's complexity, a way to lighten oneself before departure.\n\nStarted with doors attached to an unfinished perspective, this project became quite obsessive until revealing a meaning that I perceived as this introspection on naivety. Between art therapy and personal reflection, this work is a journey in which I visually experimented with some of my convictions that I, along the way, deconstructed.\n\nTo materialize this reflection, I designed a simple drawing, naively representing a set of celestial bodies and birds through cognitive doors. These doors, fixed on a stable structure without alteration, rest on a uniform background with a slight grain.\n\nFrom this original view, I then revisited each element, altering them individually before recombining them. Constructing a background of simple objects, books, and childish patterns. I added a ground and clouds to anchor this confrontation to the terrestrial. The doors combine, opening to a broader vision while reducing the number of viewpoints. The structure is distorted, dissonant, resonant, colorful, sometimes overly so, even amplified, mirroring our personal structures constantly changing and confronted by life. The doors merge, increasing the surfaces and reducing the viewpoints. The birds have changed, the celestial bodies have moved, becoming denser, taking up more space, colliding, and tearing apart. Transparency emerged, allowing a glimpse of the entirety through our own doors. The reflections of different plans connect.\n\nFrom anarchic coloring, the lines are immature, the encounters are random. This choice reflects again the desire to preserve the dissonance induced by certain encounters and the space they occupy in our internal mechanics.\n\nThis approach produced an image oscillating between disharmony and interest; sometimes pleasant, sometimes less so, even hostile or incomprehensible.\n\nThis project, in its execution, is entirely random. It was created using the p5.js, p5.noise, and chroma.js libraries.\n\nThe \"S\" key saves the three created images.",

            "description": "\"Naïf\": An Introspection on Naivety\n\nFrom childhood, naivety is perceived as innate. It embodies a form of purity, an absence of experience that could have altered its original essence. In young adults or adults, especially in our productivity-focused societies, naivety is often seen as a weakness, a dysfunction, or even an exploitable incompetence, subject to mockery. As if the hardening process, deemed necessary to make an individual apt and conforming, had not operated satisfactorily.\n\nHowever, it is paradoxical to note that literature, as well as our personal experiences, are filled with examples where an adult's naivety is a strength, a means to overcome and transcend numerous obstacles. It's also a choice, conscious or unconscious, to apply a filter to the reality we observe and engage in.\n\nWith advanced age, there is often a return to this naivety, a rediscovery of that lost innocence. In the elderly, this quality becomes, in a way, normal and even desirable, especially when it doesn't stem from illnesses. It reflects a form of wisdom and resilience in the face of life's complexity, a way to lighten oneself before departure.\n\nStarted with doors attached to an unfinished perspective, this project became quite obsessive until revealing a meaning that I perceived as this introspection on naivety. Between art therapy and personal reflection, this work is a journey in which I visually experimented with some of my convictions that I, along the way, deconstructed.\n\nTo materialize this reflection, I designed a simple drawing, naively representing a set of celestial bodies and birds through cognitive doors. These doors, fixed on a stable structure without alteration, rest on a uniform background with a slight grain.\n\nFrom this original view, I then revisited each element, altering them individually before recombining them. Constructing a background of simple objects, books, and childish patterns. I added a ground and clouds to anchor this confrontation to the terrestrial. The doors combine, opening to a broader vision while reducing the number of viewpoints. The structure is distorted, dissonant, resonant, colorful, sometimes overly so, even amplified, mirroring our personal structures constantly changing and confronted by life. The doors merge, increasing the surfaces and reducing the viewpoints. The birds have changed, the celestial bodies have moved, becoming denser, taking up more space, colliding, and tearing apart. Transparency emerged, allowing a glimpse of the entirety through our own doors. The reflections of different plans connect.\n\nFrom anarchic coloring, the lines are immature, the encounters are random. This choice reflects again the desire to preserve the dissonance induced by certain encounters and the space they occupy in our internal mechanics.\n\nThis approach produced an image oscillating between disharmony and interest; sometimes pleasant, sometimes less so, even hostile or incomprehensible.\n\nThis project, in its execution, is entirely random. It was created using the p5.js, p5.noise, and chroma.js libraries.\n\nThe \"S\" key saves the three created images.",

It seeks to understand the structure and behavior of matter at the smallest scales, exploring the most fundamental building blocks of nature and the interactions between them.\n\nHigh-energy physics investigates fundamental particles, such as quarks, leptons, and bosons, which are the building blocks of atoms and matter as we know it. It aims to answer questions about their properties, masses, charges, and the forces that govern their interactions. This field of study relies on powerful particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider, to create high-energy collisions between particles and observe the resulting reactions.\n\nDetectors play a crucial role in high-energy physics experiments. They are sophisticated instruments designed to detect, measure, and analyze the particles and their properties that are produced during high-energy collisions in particle accelerators. Detectors enable scientists to collect data and gain insights into the fundamental particles and forces that govern the universe\n\nThe ATLAS detector is a large particle detector, one of the four main detectors at the Large Hadron Collider. ATLAS stands for \"A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS\" and is designed to investigate various aspects of particle physics, including the search for new particles, the study of the Higgs boson, and the exploration of fundamental forces and particles. The detector is massive in size, measuring about 46 meters in length and 25 meters in height.\n\nBy analyzing the vast amount of data produced by the collisions, scientists can gain insights into the fundamental nature of matter, unravel the mysteries of the universe, and potentially make groundbreaking discoveries that contribute to our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.\n\nQuantum ATLAS is my artistic endeavor that seeks to emulate the infinite variety of forms that elementary particles can exhibit during collisions within detectors. From elegant spirals and swirling vortexes to branching networks and pulsating clusters, it unveils a visual tapestry of shapes and structures that echo the fundamental processes occurring at the quantum level. The intricate lines in the artwork simulate the paths of particles as they traverse the detector, leaving behind traces of their presence.\n\nPlease use fullscreen or download artwork in high resolution for a better viewing experience.
