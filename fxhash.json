            "description": "SCHNEEWALD is the second release in a row of about 12 tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years.\n\nThis project explores an approach to trees with snow using a recursive algorithm and includes Three traits: a density layer for the amount of trees and another layer for the amount snow and a third for how strong the branches bend.\n\nRendering progress indicated on the top left border\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png\n\nArtist notes:\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nI experienced it in all sorts of seasonal change, packed with snow is definitely among the most amazing! \n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: https://e-art.co/project/schneewald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright Â© 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND",

            "description": "'Here When You Need Me' is a generative system that creates...\n\nGood question, and I think the answer is up to you. Jewels? Reflections? The Sand in a Life's Hourglass?\n\nWho knows. The truth is that I didn't have anything in mind for the project, and where it has ended up was purely through exploration, and a refinement of simple methods.\n\nBy the end, it has become exactly what I needed it to be, and the results of this project give me an encouragement that is difficult to explain.\n\nNow, one of the primary features of the project is your ability to make it what you need. Several URL arguments are explained below that will allow you to tweak your edition's distortion and resolution.\n\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Girls Who Code'\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n\n10% of royalties will go to 'Girls Who Code'\n10% of royalties will go to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n10% of royalties will go to the original minter\n\nThank you everyone.\n\n\nOptions\n-------\nParameters can be appended to the live URL to adjust the output's distortion, resolution, border size, and border color. These are all fun to play with, and can be used in combination to showcase the variability and potential of each piece.\n\n'&distortion=#': Adjust distortion, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 to see a 'flat' version of the image)\n'&resolution=#': Multiplier for width/height, any value from 0.1 to 6.0 (Soft max of 3.9)\n'&borderSize=#': Multiplier for border size, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 for no border)\n'&borderColor=ffffff': Custom border color, any 6 character hex code (Do not include '#')\n\nAn example of using multiple options would be '&resolution=2&distortion=.5'\n\nPlease check the linked fx(text) article for detailed examples on using these options.\n\n\nDistortion\n----------\nI wanted to provide some amount of control to take advantage of the possibilities of generative art. 'Here When You Need Me' starts off at a certain point, but allows you to adjust the distortion to your favorite level.\n\nUsing '&distortion=0' will show the underlying shapes.\n\n\nResolution / Printing\n---------------------\n'Here When You Need Me' looks best with at least '&resolution=2' and is designed to support printing. Remember that parameters can be provided to adjust the border attributes as well.\n\nIdeally, you should aim for 300 'pixels per inch' for a decent quality print. Default resolution is 1800x2400.\n\n'&resolution=1' -> 6\"x8\"\n'&resolution=2' -> 12\"x16\"\n\nSome quick math will give you the correct modifier if you start with the width in inches of your desired print. \n\n(inches) * (ppi) / (default width)\n\nAn important note, the maximum resolution modifier I've had success with is 3.9 because of the browser's image size limitations, but the capability is still in the code to go higher in case it is helpful to someone.\n\nIf you have your edition printed, please share with me because it would make me incredibly happy to see it!\n\n\n---------\nThank you to everyone for your support and contributions. \n\nI put way more detail in this description than I intended, but if you want even more, you can read about the development and potential of this project in the accompanying fx(text) article, once it is written.\n\nCreated by Walter Anderson (@noxiarb)",

            "description": "Eucalyptus and Sagebrush is inspired by the eucalyptus trees and sagebrush found in California. These plants, and the hills they inhabit, have long been a source of beauty and adventure in my life, and I find myself repeatedly drawn back to them. The sunsets in coastal California are a perfect compliment to these hills, and I set out to represent that combination in this work.\n\nEach iteration of this algorithm feels, to me, like a glimpse out of a car window on a drive up the coast, a pause on a cool morning hike, or a memory of tearing through sharp underbrush with good company.\n\nStylistically and texturally, I drew from landscapes rendered in oil pastels, placing thousands of tiny circles, alluding to the effect of depositing particles of color onto paper. \n\nI hope that this work evokes in the viewer the feelings of peace, wildness, and adventure that I feel when I watch the sun set over these hills.\n\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\nNotes:\n- Append â&mag=Nâ to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.",

            "description": "'Here When You Need Me' is a generative system that creates...\n\nGood question, and I think the answer is up to you. Jewels? Reflections? The Sand in a Life's Hourglass?\n\nWho knows. The truth is that I didn't have anything in mind for the project, and where it has ended up was purely through exploration, and a refinement of simple methods.\n\nBy the end, it has become exactly what I needed it to be, and the results of this project give me an encouragement that is difficult to explain.\n\nNow, one of the primary features of the project is your ability to make it what you need. Several URL arguments are explained below that will allow you to tweak your edition's distortion and resolution.\n\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Girls Who Code'\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n\n10% of royalties will go to 'Girls Who Code'\n10% of royalties will go to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n10% of royalties will go to the original minter\n\nThank you everyone.\n\n\nOptions\n-------\nParameters can be appended to the live URL to adjust the output's distortion, resolution, border size, and border color. These are all fun to play with, and can be used in combination to showcase the variability and potential of each piece.\n\n'&distortion=#': Adjust distortion, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 to see a 'flat' version of the image)\n'&resolution=#': Multiplier for width/height, any value from 0.1 to 6.0 (Soft max of 3.9)\n'&borderSize=#': Multiplier for border size, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 for no border)\n'&borderColor=ffffff': Custom border color, any 6 character hex code (Do not include '#')\n\nAn example of using multiple options would be '&resolution=2&distortion=.5'\n\nPlease check the linked fx(text) article for detailed examples on using these options.\n\n\nDistortion\n----------\nI wanted to provide some amount of control to take advantage of the possibilities of generative art. 'Here When You Need Me' starts off at a certain point, but allows you to adjust the distortion to your favorite level.\n\nUsing '&distortion=0' will show the underlying shapes.\n\n\nResolution / Printing\n---------------------\n'Here When You Need Me' looks best with at least '&resolution=2' and is designed to support printing. Remember that parameters can be provided to adjust the border attributes as well.\n\nIdeally, you should aim for 300 'pixels per inch' for a decent quality print. Default resolution is 1800x2400.\n\n'&resolution=1' -> 6\"x8\"\n'&resolution=2' -> 12\"x16\"\n\nSome quick math will give you the correct modifier if you start with the width in inches of your desired print. \n\n(inches) * (ppi) / (default width)\n\nAn important note, the maximum resolution modifier I've had success with is 3.9 because of the browser's image size limitations, but the capability is still in the code to go higher in case it is helpful to someone.\n\nIf you have your edition printed, please share with me because it would make me incredibly happy to see it!\n\n\n---------\nThank you to everyone for your support and contributions. \n\nI put way more detail in this description than I intended, but if you want even more, you can read about the development and potential of this project in the accompanying fx(text) article, once it is written.\n\nCreated by Walter Anderson (@noxiarb)",

            "description": "'Here When You Need Me' is a generative system that creates...\n\nGood question, and I think the answer is up to you. Jewels? Reflections? The Sand in a Life's Hourglass?\n\nWho knows. The truth is that I didn't have anything in mind for the project, and where it has ended up was purely through exploration, and a refinement of simple methods.\n\nBy the end, it has become exactly what I needed it to be, and the results of this project give me an encouragement that is difficult to explain.\n\nNow, one of the primary features of the project is your ability to make it what you need. Several URL arguments are explained below that will allow you to tweak your edition's distortion and resolution.\n\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Girls Who Code'\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n\n10% of royalties will go to 'Girls Who Code'\n10% of royalties will go to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n10% of royalties will go to the original minter\n\nThank you everyone.\n\n\nOptions\n-------\nParameters can be appended to the live URL to adjust the output's distortion, resolution, border size, and border color. These are all fun to play with, and can be used in combination to showcase the variability and potential of each piece.\n\n'&distortion=#': Adjust distortion, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 to see a 'flat' version of the image)\n'&resolution=#': Multiplier for width/height, any value from 0.1 to 6.0 (Soft max of 3.9)\n'&borderSize=#': Multiplier for border size, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 for no border)\n'&borderColor=ffffff': Custom border color, any 6 character hex code (Do not include '#')\n\nAn example of using multiple options would be '&resolution=2&distortion=.5'\n\nPlease check the linked fx(text) article for detailed examples on using these options.\n\n\nDistortion\n----------\nI wanted to provide some amount of control to take advantage of the possibilities of generative art. 'Here When You Need Me' starts off at a certain point, but allows you to adjust the distortion to your favorite level.\n\nUsing '&distortion=0' will show the underlying shapes.\n\n\nResolution / Printing\n---------------------\n'Here When You Need Me' looks best with at least '&resolution=2' and is designed to support printing. Remember that parameters can be provided to adjust the border attributes as well.\n\nIdeally, you should aim for 300 'pixels per inch' for a decent quality print. Default resolution is 1800x2400.\n\n'&resolution=1' -> 6\"x8\"\n'&resolution=2' -> 12\"x16\"\n\nSome quick math will give you the correct modifier if you start with the width in inches of your desired print. \n\n(inches) * (ppi) / (default width)\n\nAn important note, the maximum resolution modifier I've had success with is 3.9 because of the browser's image size limitations, but the capability is still in the code to go higher in case it is helpful to someone.\n\nIf you have your edition printed, please share with me because it would make me incredibly happy to see it!\n\n\n---------\nThank you to everyone for your support and contributions. \n\nI put way more detail in this description than I intended, but if you want even more, you can read about the development and potential of this project in the accompanying fx(text) article, once it is written.\n\nCreated by Walter Anderson (@noxiarb)",

Composed in 1913, these are genuine childrenâs pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\nâEnfantines II. Enfantillages Pittoresquesâ is the second of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. âEnfantillages Pittoresquesâ experiments with predefined plots, colour blending, webgl shaders, and generative music; all with a fresh, childish style. This algorithm has been trained to draw basic shapes in accordance to Satieâs lyrics. However, it uses them in unusual ways and creates what looks like fantastic creatures, microscopic beings, or, to follow Corneille, Constant, and Appel: \"human animals\".\n\nâIt took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a childâ Attributed to Picasso (falsely, probably)\n\nWith two modes that wonât produce the same outputs, âEnfantinesâ are best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satieâs piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, these have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\nPress M or Double Tap (mobile) for AUDIO mode\nWait for SILENT mode\nPress I for Trait Info (desktop)\nPress 1 for Canvas Save (desktop)\n\nIntroduce â?pixelDensity=171â after URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\nIntroduce â?pixelDensity=Xâ for HQ renders (standard is 2, and 8 produces 400ppi 40x44cm prints).\n\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe âEnfantinesâ are educational algorithms. The code has been compressed and minified for a performance boost, but can be read fully in GitHub: https://github.com/ratchitect/\n\n\n# PERFORMANCE\nBetter experienced with Chrome.",

            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",
