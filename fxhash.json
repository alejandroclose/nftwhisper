            "description": "-Satellites-\n\nThe Space Probe project was humanity's bold endeavor to explore the universe beyond our own solar system. At the height of the space race between the years 2400 and 2500, hundreds of probe satellites were sent out into the unknown, each with a unique mission to collect data on distant galactic objects and search for signs of life and habitable planets.\nAs the probes ventured to the edge of the solar system and beyond, they extended humanity's reach and understanding of the universe. Many of these probes were equipped with the ability to communicate their findings back to Earth, allowing us to delve deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos.\nThe probes took many forms, including galactic probes, communication satellites, and planetary probes designed for sample return. As they floated in the vast wasteland that surrounds the Milky Way galaxy, these probes searched for organic molecules, the building blocks of life, and conducted their missions with determination.\nAlthough some of the probes have since become redundant, they continue to float through the void, reminders of humanity's unending quest for knowledge and discovery in the universe. The Space Probe project was a landmark achievement, pushing the boundaries of human understanding and paving the way for further exploration of the cosmos.\n\nX to toggle the Animation (on/off)\nR to reset\n\nBuild with WebGL\nGert-Jan Akerboom - 2023\n\n(20% of primary sales will go to girlswhocode.com)\n",

            "description": "- \"Whip Into Shape\": A Metaphor for Achieving Justice and Equality -\n\nThe expression \"whip into shape\" has wide-ranging implications that go beyond individual objectives and can be used in more generalized societal and cultural contexts. In light of complicated and urgent challenges including climate change, social inequality, and political division, the entire society may need to \"whip into shape\" in order to address these problems and find answers. This calls for teamwork, perseverance, and a shared dedication to ideals like justice, sustainability, and compassion.\n\nWhipping into shape an organization or institution can refer to creating accountable and transparent processes of governance to make sure individuals in positions of authority behave in the best interests of their constituents. This calls for a readiness to address dishonesty and unethical behavior while placing an emphasis on openness and justice. We may make sure that the institutions that run our society serve the interests of everyone by \"whipping\" these institutions into shape.\n\nLastly (?), \"whipping into shape\" can be used to describe addressing damaging or outmoded cultural practices and ideals. A commitment to communal discipline and effort is required to advance issues such as racial justice, environmental sustainability, and gender equality. It involves affecting people's hearts and minds, pressing back against deeply rooted notions, and committing to a more just and equal society.\n\n-----Controls---------------------\nPress 'f': to change the background color to any other color in the palette.\nPress 'g': to change the background to white.\nPress 'h': to change the background to black.\nPress 'j': to change the background to default color.\nPress 'k': to change the background color to a gradient.\n\nPress 'o': to generate a flower.\nPress 'p': to return to normal.\nPress '[': to increase the transparency of the background (same effect as 'o' or 'p' but can be controlled).\nPress ']': to decrease the transparency of the background (same effect as 'o' or 'p' but can be controlled).\n\nPress 'q', 'w': to randomize the color.\n\nPress 'a': to decrease the size of the cursor to conceal (or potentially reveal) shapes. \nPress 'd': to increase the size of the cursor to conceal (or potentially reveal) shapes.\n\nPress 'z': to display hidden shapes under the cursor faintly.\nPress 'x': to display shapes outside the cursor's radius faintly.\nPress 'c': to hide shapes outside the cursor radius.\n\nPress 's': to save\nMouse click: to create something cool.\n----------------------------------",

            "description": "fx(elevate) is a cry for parity within our community for underrepresented groups. It is released in conjunction with fx(fam) 003, our third community town hall.  Like all my 2023 releases, previous collectors of my work may collect it for free. In fact, anyone may collect it for free.  But, there is a catch.  This is not intended as a fleeting show of generic support.  It’s a personal challenge.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to elevate the artist named in your edition. Here is how it works.  Collect an edition and watch your new piece of art build.  Open it in live mode and press R.  The name of an artist will appear.  This the artist you are asked to elevate.  The artist names are from the two lists found on fxfeed.xyz: “women in genart” & “lgbtqia2s+ in genart” (see full list below).  The names themselves are fx(hash) user names, facilitating easy location of their work.\n\nHow do you elevate? Here are some ideas:\n. Explore the artist’s work, commit their name to memory, and watch for opportunities to support them\n. Follow the artist on fxfeed and social media\n. Post about and engage in discussions about the artist’s work on social media\n. Take every opportunity to ask that the artist be included in events, panel discussions, podcasts, curated exhibits, newsletters, etc.\n. Collect the artist’s work if you have the means\n. List the work you’ve collected and help build the secondary market for the artist\n. Explore fx(elevate) editions collected by others, commit the names of those artists to memory, elevate them, repeat.\n\nIf we draw attention to, and train our influence on, these important members of the fx(family), we will be the change!\n\nThe other major feature of the work is the palette.  There are twelve choices, exposed as a feature, and each one is associated with an aspirational characteristic of our community.

Like all my 2023 releases, previous collectors of my work may collect it for free. In fact, anyone may collect it for free.  But, there is a catch.  This is not intended as a fleeting show of generic support.  It’s a personal challenge.\n\nYour mission, should you choose to accept it, is to elevate the artist named in your edition. Here is how it works.  Collect an edition and watch your new piece of art build.  Open it in live mode and press R.  The name of an artist will appear.  This the artist you are asked to elevate.  The artist names are from the two lists found on fxfeed.xyz: “women in genart” & “lgbtqia2s+ in genart” (see full list below).  The names themselves are fx(hash) user names, facilitating easy location of their work.\n\nHow do you elevate? Here are some ideas:\n. Explore the artist’s work, commit their name to memory, and watch for opportunities to support them\n. Follow the artist on fxfeed and social media\n. Post about and engage in discussions about the artist’s work on social media\n. Take every opportunity to ask that the artist be included in events, panel discussions, podcasts, curated exhibits, newsletters, etc.\n. Collect the artist’s work if you have the means\n. List the work you’ve collected and help build the secondary market for the artist\n. Explore fx(elevate) editions collected by others, commit the names of those artists to memory, elevate them, repeat.\n\nIf we draw attention to, and train our influence on, these important members of the fx(family), we will be the change!\n\nThe other major feature of the work is the palette.  There are twelve choices, exposed as a feature, and each one is associated with an aspirational characteristic of our community.  You can take up the challenge of emphasizing this characteristic in yet another way of elevating our shared goal.\n\nThis work could not have been completed without the support of the fx team and two wonderful members of our fx(hash) community, cari ann shim sham* and louis.

The resulting outputs bear a resemblance to artworks produced using the lacerated poster technique, where posters are layered and torn to reveal parts of the posters underneath.\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels. Note that this will not work with sizes beyond 5000 pixels.\n\n(Allowlist is based on quantity of previous works owned).",
