            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive.

            "description": "polyzygy is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at NFT Show Europe, Valencia, 2022\n\npolyhedra -  many faces\nsyzygy - the nearly straight-line configuration of three celestial bodies\n\npolyzygy is a time-based generative artwork about periodicity: cycles, phases, periods. It is based on simple manifold polyhedral forms and their degeneration into more complex and non-manifold forms, and back, periodically. \n\nGeometrically, the manifold - non-manifold transition and cycle represents the state when the polyzygy has the potential to exist physically (manifold) to where the form no longer has a physical potential and can only be experienced digitally (non-manifold). Through this cycle, the project attempts to provide evidence that there is a continuum between what is represented as real or virtual, analog or digital; a reality continuum where our experience can exist in the domain bounded by smooth to discretized moments.\n\nThis cycle varies with each iteration, from 7 hours to 27 days. This is a project that evolves over time, and asks the viewer to do the same.\n\npolyzygy was developed from January to September 2022.\n\n- information -\n\nThis project uses an algorithm developed in C# for my other artworks. This is the first time it is ported to JavaScript and used in an interactive, time-based artwork. The algorithm is inspired by previous research into the far from origin phenomenon manifested by discrete digital numeric systems used in computers.\n\nThe work has a generation date hard coded and each iteration has a specific period which determines where it will be along its cycle. There is a timeline which shows where in the cycle the polyzygy is at the time of viewing, and the peaks of each cycle.\n\nWhen the project first loads, it is still for 15 seconds to allow for the fxhash preview image generation, then will begin rotating if the animation is enabled (it is enabled by default).\n\nThis project has been tested on various browsers, operating systems, and devices. Please test the project on your own devices before minting to ensure compatibility.\n\n\n- interaction - \n\nDouble click or double tap the canvas to show a menu with information about the time left in the polyzygy cycle. Open the console for more information about the specific iteration.\n\nAudio is EXPERIMENTAL and disabled by default. Interact with polyzygy to trigger audio. See the URL Params section on how to enable audio. Audio is generated by interacting with the polyzygy and is based on the base polyhedra of the iteration.\nWarning: Audio quality varies with different CPUs. You may experience pops and clicks on certain devices. Most of the audio is disabled on mobile devices. Lower your audio before enabling and adjust to comfortable levels.\n\n\n- menu -\n\n· >|■   toggle polyzygy animation\n· png   download image of the current polyzygy state\n· glb   download 3d model of the current polyzygy state\n\n· next cycle    shows the date and time remaining for the next cycle to begin\n\n- explore - \n\nURL Params: explore the project by using these parameters in the url when in full screen mode\n\n· period   [ int ] - seconds for a cycle. example: /?period=100\n· rotate   [ bool ] ( true, false) - toggle animation. example: /?play=false\n· debug    [ bool ] ( true, false) - show fps stats. example: /?debug=true\n· audio    [ bool ] ( true, false)  - enable the EXPERIMENTAL audio\n\nexample: <fxhash url>/?fxhash=<some hash>&period=60&play=false&debug=true\nthis sets a period of 60 seconds, does not rotate the polyzygy, and turns on debug information of fps and poly face points.\n\n- licenses and references -\n\nCreated with the help of several open source libraries: three.js, three-subdivide, tone.js, chroma.js, html2canvas, file-saver. \n\nRead LICENSE.md (add /LICENSE.md to the URL) for all licenses + refs\n\npolyzygy by Luis E.

            "description": "Initial conditions are stated, and then the particles set in motion - the root of generative art. My goal with this piece was to create an illustration that seemed to be from an earlier (or perhaps later?) time; not, at any rate, our current moment. The background is a very subtle gradient; then it is heavily stippled, and followed with a particle system to create more subtle texture. (Look for the very small \"hairs\" in the background; they are more obvious on the dark ones. They are a subset of the main particle system.) \n\nFollowing that, the main particle system is run in real time; I like to \"show my work\" for generative pieces, as any collector of my previous mints knows, and this is no exception. \"Run\" your mint for an animated drawing experience. Note that fxpreview() hits a few frames before the end of the full run. I did it this way to ensure a consistent preview. As a result, the preview and the final image will be slightly different, only because the final image has a slightly longer lifespan. \n\nThere are multiple \"special\" modes, each with a 10% likelihood: \n\n\"spiral\" will rotate the canvas as the particle system is running.\n\"chaos\" uses random X/Y vectors during the acceleration phase, rather than X or Y.\n\"occasionals\" adds random large particles in an opposing color.\n\nIn addition, there are three possible shapes:\n\n\"circle\" draws circles for the particles.\n\"square\" draws squares for the particles.\n\"jagged\" draws mostly circles, with a 0.01% chance of a square at a 45 degree angle. \n\nFinally, there is a non-attribute feature, where the entire piece is drawn at a 45 degree angle. This has a 20% likelihood, but is only apparent on pieces that have no special, or the \"occasional\" special. Working the math out, you have a 16% likelihood for getting a piece at a noticeable 45 degree angle. \n\nAll main colors have an equal likelihood, but the light background is only 20%. ",

            "description": "If light, which is generally a wave, can also sometimes be a particle - then can matter also be a wave? Louis De Broglie suggested this idea, which is supported by performing a double slit experiment with matter particles and producing an interference pattern that indicates wave behaviour. Performing the experiment with one particle at a time also produces an interference pattern, implying the particles create interference with themselves. One way this could be possible is if the particle travels infinite potential paths simultaneously, super positioning itself in many places at once. If one electron can be in infinite places at once, is it possible that all electrons are that same one? More than thinking everything is connected, can we go one further and think that everything is the same thing? \n\n'Matter Waves' super positions connections between constellated nodes, spreading them out through space in multiple ways - an aesthetic exploration of these ideas. \n\n's' to save large file\n'1' to watch it load slowly \n'2' to watch it load super slowly\n\nFully live code in p5js\n\nwww.amygoodchild.com\n@amygoodchild",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.

It starts with a collection of analog photographs, shot on film and scanned that were later used as a training dataset in Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training. This way, A.I. learns the main characteristics of film photography. In particular, it mimics its recognizable grain. Another type of pixel grain is added with the use of code and pixel shifting as well as digital manipulation. Finally, the last type of “grain” appears with the use of generative text where a different kind of A.I. was given a short description of the project and instructed to imagine the rest of the story. The fragmented and void of meaning parts of generative text are added to the images as one of the possible traits.",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.
