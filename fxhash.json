            "description": "When Yazid and Zancan started their fxcollab journey, they knew very little about each other. They learnt about their rich cultural differences, their complementary graphic styles, and a 7-hour timezone difference. What they did have in common was each had two kids about the same age (one a pair of girls, the other boys).\n\nEvery kid was born a builder; every kid likes to sit in nature. It’s their way of discovering the world and dreaming of their future accomplishments. While they marvel at the heights of the cities and monuments they construct out of stacks of cubes, parents marvel at their ability to elaborate an unlimited range of worlds out of a limited range of materials. \n\nThis project celebrates the humble and versatile cube. A deceptively simple yet powerful object of play and learning, regardless of age, whether you’re stacking them up in a sandbox, or learning 3D graphics for the first time. \n\nThis project is dedicated to kids, those who were once children, to the dreamers and builders who still enjoy playing with cubes.\n\nCoded in Vanilla JS, the project combines Yazid's iconic “Hashed/Hatched” aesthetic incorporated into childhood wooden toy block structures, and Zancan's signature lush foliage and framework, which enables all iterations to be plottable.\n \nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to get a SVG file suited for plotters\n- Click on the image to download a 4K resolution PNG",

            "description": "In march of this year, I started working on a new series involving multi-layering, and overriding shapes. Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

The project provides a unique glimpse into an alternate universe in which Bwople could have been represented.\n\nAll images are hand-drawn work by Gengoya and composed by Vector Recite using PureSpider's fxhash-pfp maker tool.\n\nTo download the full size image on fx(hash):\n- Click \"open\" below the image\n- Left click on the image, a \"Download image\" button will appear on the bottom right.\n- Click the \"Download image\" button.",

Drawing and playing with colors and opacity.\nIt started with squares and grid, it then involved deformations, and circles and other experimentations.\nThis path fits with my artistic generative approach: rather than having a completely predefined idea, I start with a simple concept that evolves during creation. Then surprises happened, and I embraced them.\n\nBut this year was not like any other: 2022 has gifted me with a new birthday, the one of my son.\n\nOver the past twelve months, I’ve watched him discovering the world surrounding him, learning and trying new things, laughing, or getting frustrated, sad or happy…\nWhile learning to become a parent, I’ve been in an introspection phase where I questioned what it means to be “a father”. What impact will I have on my son, consciously or not?\n\n“Foundations” takes shape in this context: 2 humans trying and exploring while being inspired by each other.\nThis series is a first of a set of at least 3, that illustrates an idea of what is an “Identity”, and what makes us who we are.\n\nThe foundations of an identity are laid in the first days of a child’s life. They will be influenced by many factors; including parenting, cultural environment, life experiences… \nOf course, as humans we are in constant evolution; life happens, sometimes for the best, sometimes for the worst, and our personality will be impacted…\nBut this will be a topic for another time. \n\n\nToday, we are at the start.\n",

            "description": "“You can’t depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus.” — Mark Twain\n\nThe subtle animation captures the essence of focus and movement. The sharp angles of the triangles draw the viewer's gaze towards the center of the piece, where the lines converge and intersect. This central point of focus is further emphasized by the sweeping curves and dynamic shapes that flow outwards from it, creating a sense of motion and energy.\n\nOverall, the combination of triangles, focus, and movement creates a sense of tension and drama, inviting the viewer to explore the piece and discover its hidden depths. Whether viewed up close or from a distance, this artwork is sure to captivate and engage the viewer with its dynamic interplay of form and movement.\n\nPress *Space bar* to stop and restart the animation.\nPress *e* to epxort the image as PNG in 4000x4000px.\n\nUse the URL parameters *animated=false/true* to start with or without animation.\n\nStefan Schwaha, @sektionschef, https://digitalitility.com/",

            "description": "Near the start of December @Studio Yorktown launched his \"Studio Yorktown Color Town Hall\" library of wonderful colour palettes.\n\n\"You know what this Town Hall needs?\" I asked no one in particular, \"Vents!\". Besides, what's more Christmassy than a good old vent?\n\nSome nice soothing gradients, with a selection of innies and outies, structure, form, and sometimes sharp edges. I humbly suggest aiming to get a set of three 😁\n\nThank you for everything fxhash in 2022, looking forwards to 2023!\n\nREAD MORE: https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/vents\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::\n\nh - Toggle high-res\nn - toggle noise on/off\ns - Download and save image\n\nPRINTING INSTRUCTIONS ::\n\nHigh-res will output a 8,192 x 8,192 image, at 300dpi it should print at...\n\n27.3 x 27.3 inches\n69.3 x 69.3 cm",
