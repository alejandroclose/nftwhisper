            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",

            "description": "Summer Daydream is the final chapter in a nature trilogy that I've worked on throughout 2023. The inspiration comes from both the superbloom in California this spring, and the carefree summer vacations of my childhood. I used to live close to a beautiful woodland in northern China, with a willow-lined creek filled with lotus and water lilies. I spent many long summer days playing in the woods with my friends, pretending to be explorers, detectives, martial arts masters, and more ... back then I only dreamed of the future, and now I sometimes dream of the past. Things as small as the taste of a hawthorn berry or the fragrance of a pagoda tree would pull my mind back to that simpler time. I can't remember the shape of the creek or the paths we took, yet the colors are still vivid as new, and they bring me a sense of happiness and peace. \n\nThe artwork is best viewed in full screen mode in a Chrome browser. \n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.09\n\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is based on the width of the browser window.\n[j] Save a JPEG image of the live view, default resolution is based on the width of the browser window.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 1.78 (16/9)]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1.33]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n&res=[output size of the long edge]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",

These calcified data deposits have accumulated over eons, forming physical tectons that span light-years of space. They offer a glimpse into the fundamental building blocks employed by a forgotten alien civilization which encoded its entire culture as digital data in physical form. While the specifications for this stellar machine have been lost to time, its fractured components continue to perform computations, seemingly trapped in an eternal loop. We can observe the inner workings of this enigmatic structure, but its true meaning remains forever silent, its message encrypted.\n\nT E C T O N I C A serves as an artistic exploration of this fictional world and its algorithm-driven deep-space geology. Collectors can reserve their iteration by minting a ticket and use the params interface to choose their seed number and triptych part.

            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

            "description": "\"In the boundless loneliness of space, strangeness abounds.\"\nT E C T O N I C A logs\n\nStanding here are the digital engrams of a spacefaring civilization, the final remnants of the Universe's vast computer, a layered stratum of glitched, galaxy-sized digital memory banks. These calcified data deposits have accumulated over eons, forming physical tectons that span light-years of space. They offer a glimpse into the fundamental building blocks employed by a forgotten alien civilization which encoded its entire culture as digital data in physical form. While the specifications for this stellar machine have been lost to time, its fractured components continue to perform computations, seemingly trapped in an eternal loop. We can observe the inner workings of this enigmatic structure, but its true meaning remains forever silent, its message encrypted.\n\nT E C T O N I C A serves as an artistic exploration of this fictional world and its algorithm-driven deep-space geology. Collectors can reserve their iteration by minting a ticket and use the params interface to choose their seed number and triptych part. Generator uses a WYSIWYG principle to derive a PRNG seed from the wallet address and the chosen seed number. There are 1000 seeds available for each wallet. You can explore seeds using a separate seed explorer here:\n\nhttps://protocell-labs.github.io/tectonica-seed-explorer/\n\n__________\n\nT E C T O N I C A is written in JavaScript using Three.js library for displaying instantiated 3D geometry and in-browser rendering (see LICENSE file for the list of all dependencies). We recommend using Chromium browser on desktop with a newer generation GPU card and enabled hardware acceleration to get the full functionality (like key controls). Please ensure that the token functions correctly on your device before minting.\n\nUse click (touch) to explode / unexplode the structure, click hold (touch hold) to set new explosion center (also E + click), P for pause / unpause palette cycle, B to change background color, S to download loader animation, G for gif capture, and numbers 1-5 to export progressively higher resolution of the artwork as a png image. Available URL parameters are listed in the browser console.\n\nWe paid tribute to artists and personalities who inspire our work by naming color palettes after them. To support other fellow artists on their creative journeys, we have left T E C T O N I C A code open (unminified and unobfuscated) and available in a public repository on GitHub. We believe that supporting open tools is a mission every generative artist should partake in.\n\nCreated in 2024 by {protocell:labs}",

            "description": "Start with something simple. Take four identical equilateral triangles and join them to form a pyramid. This is your building block – a regular tetrahedron, the simplest possible three-dimensional figure.\n\nWhen you connect five such pyramids by attaching their faces, you will be left with a thin empty space between the first and last: a volumetric angle of 7.356 degrees. It’s too small to fit another piece and too big to be lost in numerical imprecision.\n\nIt is a surprising imperfection. You would expect a tetrahedron to behave similarly to its two-dimensional ancestor. When you arrange equilateral triangles, one next to the other like tiles, you can cover two-dimensional space without leaving an empty spot. You may go on forever, covering infinite planes and be sure that the six angles that meet at each point will add up to the perfect 360 degrees.\n\nIn three dimensions, it is not like this: you cannot use your building block to fully fill a void. It’s as if the mathematical rules –the ones we tend to idealise for elegance, harmony, and infallibility– broke when you raise complexity.\n\nBut mathematical beauty does not reside in perfection. It is through these exceptions that complexity emerges. So keep building, face by face, one block at a time, and embrace the surprising, chaotic aesthetics that appears. A different type of harmony – not based on impeccable proportions, but on unpredictability.\n\n---\n\nThe colours of the structures are inspired by 16 paintings of Polish artists from the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\n\"In a window\" by Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga against a Yellow Background\" by Józef Mehoffer\n\"Portrait of Zofia Okuń\" by Edward Okuń\n\"Girl with chrysanthemums\" by Olga Boznańska\n\"Nocturne – Swans in Ogród Saski in Warsaw by Night\" by Józef Pankiewicz\n\"Soil\" by Ferdynand Ruszczyc\n\"Obsession\" by Wojciech Weiss\n\"Self-portrait in armour\" by Jacek Malczewski\n\"Self-portrait\" by Artur Grottger\n\"Portrait of Jadwiga Dembowska\" by Leopold Horowitz\n\"Death of Barbara Radziwiłł\" by Józef Simmler\n\"Before the Sunrise\" by Józef Chełmoński\n\"With brushwood\" by Julian Fałat\nStudy for the painting \"In a Bower\" by Aleksander Gierymski\n\"Woman Combing her Hair\" by Władysław Ślewiński\n\"Still life with a heron\" by Władysław Czachórski\n\n---\n\nClick on the image for resolution options.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nClick PNG to save the rendered image.

            "description": "The Visible Manifestation of Invisible Forces\n\n“Fantasies of the past determined by needs of the present have a direct impact on realities of the future.” –– Svetlana Boym\n\n\nThis series continues my explorations into generative abstract expressionism, building on the techniques and approaches of my previous works “THE400FLIPS” and “a fortiori.” This time viewers can interact with the piece by adding more particles onto the canvas, effectively altering the behaviour set by the transaction hash —a collaboration between the artist, chance, and the collector. \n\nArt is fantastic and induces fantasies: This is one of those cases where the art is more than the thumbnail. I encourage you to run the code and interact with the canvas. As you alter the outputs, you will experience them as fleeting moments. Seen and gone, unless you are fast enough to catch them as we do with photographs: use the spacebar to pause the animation, then save a png image file by pressing “s”.\n\nConsider each reload and interaction a new simulation of life.\n\n\nThis work is, at its core, an implementation of Craig Reynolds’s Boids program to simulate the flocking behaviour of birds. As such, the flocking parts used in this work are released under the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n\nControls:\n[s] Save as PNG.\n[spacebar] or [x][z] Pause/Play.\n[Click and drag] Add more particles to the canvas.\n\n\nSoundtrack:\nI curated a Spotify soundtrack to accompany the work. Enjoy:\n\nhttps://open.spotify.com/playlist/1Nn2dM4cLqOukBDcryKk1d?si=cc48c678e6f34c2b\n\n\nNotes:\nCreated with p5.js and GLSL – optimised for Chrome – designed to be experienced on a desktop computer.\n\nThe preview capture module uses GPU instances. It may take time for thumbnails to appear. \n\n\nWarning:\nIt contains flashing lights and colours that may affect people with visual sensitivities.\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2023 Thomas Noya\n\n◉_◉",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

It was a time marked by anxiety, uncertainty, and disillusionment. But, New World was also inspired by the hope embodied in my creative process and the genart community. Hence, the collection takes on a double meaning: a new world can form out of destruction or creation. \n\nAlgorithm:\nThe collection is completely generative and written with p5.js. It began as an exploration of the dual contouring algorithm and purposefully builds on a bug I introduced when filling the contours by selecting vertices out of winding order. \n\nPricing:\nDutch Auction: 16xtz -> 12xtz -> 8xtz decreasing every 10 minutes.\n\nCharity:\n5% of the primary sales will be donated to Ukrainian humanitarian aid funds through the contract set up by @ciphrd and @Veqtor.\n\nControls:\nKey ’s’: Save an image of the output at the current resolution (available once the piece has finished generating)\nKey ‘Arrow Up’ & ‘Arrow Down’: Cycle through resolution scaling factors at increments of 1080p. 1080p is the minimum resolution. There is no maximum resolution but loading performance will worsen at higher scaling\nKey ‘o’: Toggle the land outlines on or off\n\nBrowser Support:\nConfirmed to work on desktop browsers (Chrome Version 99.0.4844.51, Safari v15.3, Firefox v98.0) and Safari iOS v14.8\n\nLicense:\nNFT License",

            "description": "BRIDGE is a collaborative project for fx(hash), conceived by Camille Roux. The project was announced on Twitter on Feb. 7, 2022 [1]. Artists were given two weeks to contribute code that would draw tiles representing a bridge, in their own style. Artists were free to implement their own artistic vision, subject to one simple constraint: Respect the coordinates of the tiles for each iteration of the art. \n\nEach iteration has a default style determined randomly at mint. This style is named in the features and displayed in the thumbnail. However, each iteration includes all styles, and you can cycle through them by clicking on or touching the image. Styles will be shown in the order in which they are listed under INCLUDED STYLES.\n\nPress \"s\" to save a screenshot.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nI'm Camille Roux. I planned to do a lot of collab this year with fx(hash) artists I like, but it takes too much time, or maybe I like too many artists :) Some days ago, I woke up with this idea in mind: \"Hey! What if I make a collaboration with all the artists I like at once!\" This is how the BRIDGE project was born.\n\nMoreover, I love the mutual aid and solidarity between fx(hash) generative artists. The BRIDGE can be seen as a symbol of the link between us ♥️.\n\nThe project has also served as an inspiration for participants to extend and develop their coding skills outside their usual areas of interest. The code for the entire project remains available on GitHub [2].\n\nTHE INCLUDED STYLES\n\nText-to-Bridge (TTB) by Ada Ada Ada\nhttps://twitter.com/ada_ada_ada_art\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ada%20Ada%20Ada\n\nBlest Path by Anaglyphic\nhttps://twitter.com/anaglyph_ic\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/anaglyphic\n\nThe Old Woody Dock by Aqw_Zert\nhttps://twitter.com/Aqw_Zert\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Aqw_Zert\n\nBridge-Tunnel by Laurent Houdard\nhttps://twitter.com/CablesAndPixels\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Laurent%20Houdard\n\nEvaporating by Camille Roux\nhttps://twitter.com/camillerouxart\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Camille%20Roux\n\nBuildings by Camille Roux\nhttps://twitter.com/camillerouxart\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Camille%20Roux\n\nTGH Bridge by David Esq\nhttps://twitter.com/emcyze\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/David%20Esq\n\nCitadel by devnull\nhttps://twitter.com/lostpunks\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/devnull\n\nEinstein–Rosen by Elsif\nhttps://twitter.com/ElsifThen\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/elsif\n\nPath through the city by Estienne\nhttps://twitter.com/Estienne_ca\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Estienne\n\nstarry night//glitchy night by frederative\nhttps://twitter.com/frederative\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/frederative\n\nBlackboard by Generative Pen\nhttps://twitter.com/GenerativePen\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Generative%20Pen\n\nMozaik by Gorik\nhttps://twitter.com/gorikfr\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Gorik\n\nDevour by grosgg\nhttps://twitter.com/rosgg\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/grosgg\n\nburning bridges by jeres\nhttps://twitter.com/heyjeres\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/jeres\n\nSpace Disco Dancefloor by Julien Labat\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienLabat\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/julabat\n\n/nt/r/t///a/ by lunarean\nhttps://twitter.com/lunarean\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/lunarean\n\nNara by Makio64\nhttps://twitter.com/makio64\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Makio64\n\nBifrost by mandyBrigwell\nhttps://twitter.com/mandybrigwell\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/mandybrigwell\n\nRain under the stars by Matt Circles\nhttps://twitter.com/matt_circles\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Matt%20Circles\n\nEsoteric Oasis by Nick Dima\nhttps://twitter.com/nickdima\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Nick%20Dima\n\nStreet Lights by phil_osophie\nhttps://twitter.com/phil_osophie\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/phil_osophie\n\nRise by Robin Metcalfe\nhttps://twitter.com/solarise_webdev\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Robin\n\nFlower Bridge by RVig\nhttps://twitter.com/rvig_art\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/rvig\n\nhere comes the sun by shuhblam\nhttps://twitter.com/shuhblam\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/shuhblam\n\nInto another world by Claus O.

Yet, from a perspective, it all gets compressed into a single thread. Some of the events are brighter and more memorable. Others just blend or fade away.\n\nI welcomed November 2021 with huge excitement and celebration. The joyful beginning of the month was followed by weeks of misery, anxiety, denial, and acceptance. It was a hard time, but in the long run, it was liberating and started a process of change. Change that happens dynamically to this day.\n\nI couldn't join you last year, but I'm celebrating with you today!\n\n\n\nIn memory of my Dad.\n\n\n\nDonations:\n40% – Savepakistan - Flood Relief Fundraiser\n10% – Three.js",
