            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

There is a limited amount of javascript to construct the scene and facilitate interactive controls. 🚫 <canvas>!\n\nA bit of history about this approach: As my first coding language HTML and CSS holds a special place in my heart. Even when I jumped into 3D my first creations were made with just some html + css coded in notepad. Earlier this year I took this idea to the next level with a yet-to-be-released 3D bedrooms project, filling it with objects and ever-refining my scene construction practice.

There is a limited amount of javascript to construct the scene and facilitate interactive controls. 🚫 <canvas>!\n\nA bit of history about this approach: As my first coding language HTML and CSS holds a special place in my heart. Even when I jumped into 3D my first creations were made with just some html + css coded in notepad. Earlier this year I took this idea to the next level with a yet-to-be-released 3D bedrooms project, filling it with objects and ever-refining my scene construction practice.

            "description": "This is a work about growth, impermanence and decay. Ghostly plants and flowers grow around an invisible point, but they immediately begin to fade into the dark background and are soon replaced and covered by others. This process of accumulation and disappearance builds an ever-changing floral garland, or perhaps a funeral wreath.\n\nThe monochrome vegetation is part of a fictional flora, born out of random algorithmic combinations, and does not intend to reproduce any real species. It belongs to an “artificial nature” which, like so many worlds that the computers generate for us in movies, games, and virtual reality environments, is a convincing simulation of life, but it is not actually living. AI bots, virtual assistants and non-player characters are also representatives of the uncanny realm of the not-really-alive-but-looking-like-it, which are becoming an increasingly relevant presence in our everyday lives.\n\nThese plants and flowers speak about life as a process of incessant renovation, but also about death as the background that’s always there and makes life possible. This spectral vegetation seems to thrive precisely at the verge between both worlds.\n_______________\n\n\nThis work is animated and will adapt to any screen size. It generates a never-ending ring of algorithmic foliage, which never repeats itself, and is different for each token. The image preview is triggered after the first five plants or flowers.\nMade with p5.js\n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture",

            "description": "A 4444 character magic spell for my rayhatching framework to render thinking rocks.\n\nThis piece may take some time to render (about 1-3 minutes, depending on hardware). The rendering time is symbolic of the vastness and agelessness of these rock structures, it is recommended to use the rendering time to contemplate deeply the concept of time spans so incredibly long, that to experience them they would have to overwrite your memories several times and thus are impossible to truly comprehend.\n\nTo ponder how, if they are so old, how come some of them float? Are these rocks the fixtures and has time and space itself eroded around them?\n\nThis project uses an approach called \"rejection sampling\". This means the program generates a random set of parameters, and then checks/previews how the resulting image would look. It measures the amount of visible objects, light and shadows, and then determines whether these fall into acceptable ranges. If not, it generates a new set of parameters. For certain hashes over a 100 parameter sets may be checked before it accepts the image.\n\nThe features of this project are \"cliff\", \"ground\", \"thing\" and \"sky\". These are not parameters, they are actual measurements of the resulting image, indicating what percentage of the view is occupied.\n\nThis piece can be saved as an SVG and plotted. It is recommended to run a path order optimization tool such as vpype or axicli, this will greatly reduce plotting time.\n\nSome options can be changed via the URL:\n\n&w=.25 : The line width in millimetres.\n&d=.4 : Line density (multiplier to linewidth).\n&h=235 : Page height in millimetres. The aspect ratio is 16:9, for a width of 420mm, suitable for A3 plotting.\n\nThe line width is set to 0.25 millimetres to suit most common fine liner pen stroke widths when plotting. \n\nIf you don't intend to plot this piece, perhaps also try rendering it at 0.2 or even 0.1 millimetres line width, for an even more detailed image (it will also take longer to render).\n\n(c) 2022 by Piter Pasma",

            "description": "===== A Simple Fail =====\n\nAn attempt to release a quick follow-up to Adherence following simple rules and a concise set of features has utterly failed!  I ended up spending 9 months of development on this \"quick\" project; I didn't even spend that much time on Adherence.  What happened?  First, and foremost, I had no intention to ever release a project that I wouldn't be absolutely excited about if I were to see in the Incoming feed as a collector.  Nothing wrong with that, right!?  But, not all factors that delayed this project were so noble.  I have to admit that as I continued to stack features and techniques, my codebase, once again, has gotten away from me.  I'm not too worried about how poor my code will look to lurkers (although, God help them!).  But, poor code, without question, hampers the ability for a developer to iterate.  Each shortcut a developer takes lays traps along paths that will eventually be revisited and I took A LOT of shortcuts in my excitement of each new idea.\n\nAppropriately, my failures are fully in keeping with the project itself.  A Simple Fail explores a favorite generative theme of human imperfection through the construction of each mints foundational grid to the \"inaccuracy\" of draw styles that fill each shape.  \n\n<Read more about A Simple Fail:\n@ https://www.bfos.art/projects/a-simple-fail \n@ https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/a-simple-fail>\n\n\n==== fx(params) Info ====\n\nWARNING: 1-Day Grace Period!\n\nThere is only a 24 hour grace period before mint tickets will need to be protected with the params tax.  Why?  Because there is currently no way to trade mint tickets during the grace period.  If you don't mint your ticket immediately, I STRONGLY suggest that you immediately update the price and tax coverage on your mint ticket.  This should only matter in the fortuitous case of a sell out, but I wanted to make sure this was communicated clearly just in case!\n\nI had initially decided to not include params in this project at all.  I think params are great, but most projects released with params so far have suffered because of them, in my opinion.  Params often detract from the artist's efforts to craft the feature-probability space and tuning of the project.  I put a lot of effort into that in this project and I didn't want to see collectors struggle to replicate what I've already crafted.  That said, I loved the restrained way Tyler Boswell (@teaboswell) implemented params in Reunion to give collectors a limited ability to choose their mints.  I thought 25 seeds per wallet was a little on the light side.  So, I have doubled that to 50 potential mints a wallet can choose from.  I have also configured an option to mint a completely random mint in the traditional style.  The features in your mint might include a complementary tip of the hat to your faithfulness for being so bold!  This option is selected by default.\n\n\n===== Interactions =====\n\n{A}dapt to device screen size (twice to rotate, thrice to original)\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{P}erfect grid switch\n{Z}oom switch\n{1-8} Save at x multiple of screen size\n\n== Print Options ==\n{B}ackground switch\n{F}rame switch\n{G}rain switch\n{H}ighlight switch\n\n== URL Parameters (useful for adjusting and saving on mobile devices) ==\n(Start your group of parameters by appending \"&\" to the end of your token URL following the fxparam parameters.

This should only matter in the fortuitous case of a sell out, but I wanted to make sure this was communicated clearly just in case!\n\nI had initially decided to not include params in this project at all.  I think params are great, but most projects released with params so far have suffered because of them, in my opinion.  Params often detract from the artist's efforts to craft the feature-probability space and tuning of the project.  I put a lot of effort into that in this project and I didn't want to see collectors struggle to replicate what I've already crafted.  That said, I loved the restrained way Tyler Boswell (@teaboswell) implemented params in Reunion to give collectors a limited ability to choose their mints.  I thought 25 seeds per wallet was a little on the light side.  So, I have doubled that to 50 potential mints a wallet can choose from.  I have also configured an option to mint a completely random mint in the traditional style.  The features in your mint might include a complementary tip of the hat to your faithfulness for being so bold!  This option is selected by default.\n\n\n===== Interactions =====\n\n{A}dapt to device screen size (twice to rotate, thrice to original)\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{P}erfect grid switch\n{Z}oom switch\n{1-8} Save at x multiple of screen size\n\n== Print Options ==\n{B}ackground switch\n{F}rame switch\n{G}rain switch\n{H}ighlight switch\n\n== URL Parameters (useful for adjusting and saving on mobile devices) ==\n(Start your group of parameters by appending \"&\" to the end of your token URL following the fxparam parameters.

It is a comtemplation of the passing of time, the inevitability of change, and the beauty that can be found in impermanence. It is an invitation to reflect on the fluidity of life and our own place within the grander scheme of things. A testament to the resilience and grit required to survive in a constantly changing world. Despite the harsh conditions and ever-present threat of change, the desert sands endure, shifting but not breaking; their beauty and strength undiminished.\n\nMade of several overlapping curved lines, each piece is a depiction of movement and fluidity, symbolizing sands in a constant state of motion. The curves blend and mix, creating new patterns and hues where they overlap, much like the way that life experiences blend and mix to create new and unique outcomes. The uneven distribution of grains across each piece represents timelessness. Areas of low accumulation of grains are a reminder of the years of constant erosion. The sands of time have existed and will exist in a state of constant motion and change for eons, for the lifetime. This way, each piece also evokes nostalgia, as we ponder on our past lives.\n\n“It’s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your life’s story will develop.” ― Dieter F.

It is a comtemplation of the passing of time, the inevitability of change, and the beauty that can be found in impermanence. It is an invitation to reflect on the fluidity of life and our own place within the grander scheme of things. A testament to the resilience and grit required to survive in a constantly changing world. Despite the harsh conditions and ever-present threat of change, the desert sands endure, shifting but not breaking; their beauty and strength undiminished.\n\nMade of several overlapping curved lines, each piece is a depiction of movement and fluidity, symbolizing sands in a constant state of motion. The curves blend and mix, creating new patterns and hues where they overlap, much like the way that life experiences blend and mix to create new and unique outcomes. The uneven distribution of grains across each piece represents timelessness. Areas of low accumulation of grains are a reminder of the years of constant erosion. The sands of time have existed and will exist in a state of constant motion and change for eons, for the lifetime. This way, each piece also evokes nostalgia, as we ponder on our past lives.\n\n“It’s your reaction to adversity, not adversity itself that determines how your life’s story will develop.” ― Dieter F. Uchtdorf",
