            "description": ">>> GAN ⫷glitch⫸ Ting Xu |  幹亭序 <<<\n\n• Generative glitch collage: More than simply a + b + c •\n\n\nAt the apex of Chinese calligraphy, Lantingji Xu, the preface, was written by the most renowned calligrapher in China, Wang Xizhi (王羲之).\n\nDuring the Spring Purification Ceremony, forty-two literati gathered along the banks of a coursing stream and engaged in a \"winding stream\" drinking contest: cups of wine were floated on the water upstream, and whenever a cup stopped in front of a guest, they had to compose a poem or otherwise drink the wine. At the end of the day, twenty-six literati composed thirty-seven poems in total and the Lantingji Xu, as a preface to the collection, was produced by Wang on the spot.\n\nIn the GTX collection, we create new intricate and expressive relationships between ink, paper, and pixels using Jimi's raw calligraphy work, their GAN offsprings, and Thomas's CHX-like glitch processing, generating unique calligraphy on mint and toasting at the same time.\n\n\nHow it works:\n\nCombining sets of raw layers that range from paintings, calligraphy, and GAN seeds, our algorithm applies an array of image processing magic, creating intricate novel outputs.\n\nWe have 102 raw layers separated into four groups. Each final output is formed by mixing and processing four randomly selected layers. \n\nGroup 1 contains textures, and it is composed of Jimi's paintings, GAN seeds from mixed custom models, and CLIP Guided Diffusions. \n\nGroup 2 contains Jimi's calligraphy work. \n\nGroup 3 contains GAN calligraphy seeds from custom models we trained on Jimi's body of work. \n\nGroup 4 contains digital grain textures.\nOur algorithm starts by selecting one layer from each group, assigning them sizes, opacities, orientations, and other parameters. Then it sets a dithering combination to be applied. We have eight combos formed by combining seven different custom dithering algorithms (3 at a time). \n\nAfter each dither gets applied to its corresponding layer, images get mixed using different blend modes to help combine them in fun ways. Afterwards, a couple more filters get applied to glue everything together. When all is said and done, final artworks get rendered onto the canvas.\n\nSit back, open the live view, and enjoy. \n\n\nAppreciate the art, not the speculation. Pay what you can. \n\nWith love, sweat, and tears –drops– \nJimi and Thomas.\n\n\nJimi's notes:\n\nI provided the calligraphy representing the extreme spectrum of my expression in brushwork and poetry. I also evaluated the GAN calligraphy outputs, helping Thomas hone the models. During the training process I was horrified and in awe by both the stupidity and sometimes brilliance of the GANs.\n\nThrough the layering techniques developed by Thomas, I have also gained new insights into calligraphy, taking it beyond brush, ink and paper. The spectrum of expression in calligraphy gets freed from traditional constraints in GTX. Fx(hash) calligraphy has become brush, code and screen. \n\nThomas does not read Chinese, but I was happy to let him crop my scrolls into square layers in ways he saw fit with the project's aesthetic. To my surprise, I did not only agree with his visual choices but also noticed how the illiterate crops had many Freudian slips. That is, my poetry made sense fractally. I think this is no coincidence for calligraphers that write their poetry. Calligraphy is more than the sum of beautiful brushstrokes and also greater than the sum of pretty characters. Calligraphy is the composition of space and semantics. Only in turn does meaning takes its place in parts of calligraphy. \n\n\nControls:\n[s] save as PNG.\n\n\nPaint / Ink / Photography –> GANs / Diffusions –> p5.js –> Blockchain\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2022 Thomas Noya and Jimi Wen\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n◉_◉ ◉_◉",

            "description": "‘Impressions of Order’ is a collection of 300 generative compositions. \n\nInspired by 90s ROM cartridges, server farms and future cityscapes this project explores perception and documentation of ‘order’ within complex systems. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis artwork is best enjoyed in high-resolution so that the subtle layering, colour shifts, variation in hard and soft edges, faint impressions of construction, and the various low-probability glitchy events can be fully appreciated. \n\nBy default, the artwork will load in 2K resolution (1400 x 2000 px). It is recommended that you view the work in 4K or 6K to appreciate the finer details. \n\nThe keyboard buttons: “2”, “4”, and “6” can be pressed to change the resolution to 2K, 4K and 6K resolution accordingly. \n\nTo download an image at its current resolution, press the keyboard button “S”.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtwork created with p5.js\n\n@nbswwit\nSept 2022\n",

This may be what is often referred to as introversion and shyness. However, our inner world is often very full of emotions. We have that one switch or lock on the door of our heart that is usually closed. It's used to protect ourselves, or to hide ourselves. But, we also need that one moment to let the budding emotions inside us blossom. Yes, maybe it's now! It's time to untie that knot that's been tied for a long time, let the cheer be released, let's cheers, and let's celebrate!\n\nPress [s] to save the image.\n\nBy Samuel YAN\nMade with p5.js / glsl",

            "description": "“Arraigos, islas con memoria” is an installation project that will be showcased in Madrid in October 2023. It is a project about the immigration process of 3 Peruvian women artists living in Spain.\nMy starting point towards the installation, is Legado, a generative art piece I created in 2022 where I explored the legacy of the women in my family and how I integrate it in my present life to take care of myself.\nBased on this, I am in an exploration process where I delve into my own history, my origins to recognize how I nurture myself in the present in another country. “Arraigos, estudios 1” is born out of this process. As I begin to acknowledge that all possible routes in life are part of a whole. That all lines converge.  That each path and each decision I make brings me closer to home, I feel safe and cared.\n\nI plan (hopefully) to share more of these explorations that take a generative art form in the next months.\n“Arraigos, islas con memoria” is developed thanks to the support of the program Ayudas a la creación y la movilidad del Ayuntamiento de Madrid.\n\nPress from “1” to “9” to render at higher resolutions. \nPress “s” to save a .png file at you given resolution.\nPress “b” to add a borderline.

A mix between digital renderings with colorful lines, blendings and scratches to add a non-perfect visual. A grid is generated and partially visible managed by a noise.\nThe lines can be limited to 1 direction, and can be distorted.\n\nLines are animated with an infinite algorithm to create a mesmerizing animation.  \nThe pieces's size, position and frequency are generated for each token, along with the colour theme and the composition effect.   \n\nYou can click to play/pause the animation.\n\nFeatures :\n- flowLinesCount: number of lines to create the pencils scratches\n- MultipleLinesDirections: boolean to determine if the lines have 1 or 2 directions\n- LinesCount: number of lines\n- smallLines: boolean, if lines are thin or bold\n- flowFieldDirection : x, y, or both\n- colorTheme: name of the color theme\n- filter: Canvas composition effect applied : difference, multiply, xor, hard-light, source-over\n- isDistorted: distortions enabled\n\n Handmade by code with Javascript, made with fragment.tools \nQuentin Hocdé, Brussels (Belgium), 2023.",
