            "description": "The first blueprint was found in 1947 on the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea.\nIt has been studied several times.\nNumerous theories arose trying to explain its origin.\nNone of them was decided conclusively.\n\nOne year ago, a rare group of waves coming from space was intercepted on earth.\nThis happened during the 2021 summer.\nIt was unclear if they were born from natural events.\nDying stars, black holes... Humans tried to find patterns. Find a meaning for them.\nNone of the analyses made any sense.\n\nBai was a young physicist and Ph.D. student.\nHer mother was a civil engineer working in finance.\nHer father was an architect and a generative artist.\nShe had a personal interest in linguistics and algorithmic art, influenced by her father.\nShe was the one who managed to decrypt the information using her own algorithms.\n\nThose frequencies were the gate to sets of technical drawings, matching precisely the physical blueprint found in 1947.\n\nIt's been a year since the waves were discovered.\nNo definite conclusions have been made yet regarding their origin or their meaning.\nNevertheless, the number of theories keeps increasing with every new blueprint decrypted.\n\nThe frequencies keep passing by the earth.\nThere is still so much investigation to be carried out.\nSo many questions to be answered.\nYet, the financial crisis is making the budget for investigation decrease rapidly.\nThe Institute of Space Sciences is running an initiative to self-fund this project.\nThree hundred thirteen open spots can then seize those waves.\nEncapsulating them as NFTs.\n\n\n—--------------------\n\nThis project is an attempt to experiment with two main ideas arising from technical plans:\n\n1. The inner beauty of architectural plans, city plans, industrial blueprints, and any other type of documents of that nature. A study of graphic elements like annotations, dashed lines, grids, etc. disposed of in different manners to create aesthetically appealing compositions.\n\n2. How does the viewer analyze and interpret abstract compositions of technical plans? Triggering different thoughts and ideas: A Rorschach test with blueprints instead of ink blots.\n\n—--------------------\n\nAll the minters at the first tear of the dutch auction will be able to claim A or B: A being one HD signed print of their blueprint or B their unique 1/1, on top of the NFT minted.\n\nThose unique 1/1s will be pre-curated outputs from this algorithm. Some of the 1/1 parameters could be chosen by the minter: colors, main composition, shapes, density, name of the blueprint... so that the result will be a collaboration between the minter, Ismahelio, and the algorithm itself.\n\nMinters at the second tier of the dutch auction can claim one unique 1/1. The difference with the first tier is that the minter won't be involved in the design process. The piece will be designed and curated by Ismahelio.\n\nIf there are any of these 1/1s to be claimed. They will be minted within an Objkt.com collection and airdropped to the minters.\n\n—--------------------\nHeavily dense compositions might not load on some mobile devices with insufficient memory.\nThe quality of the piece on phones and tablets has been decreased programmatically.\nVisualize the piece in a powerful enough computer for the best experience.\n\nClick 1: Activate\nClick 2: increase speed\n1: save 4000x4000 png\n2: save 6000x6000 png\n3: save 8000x8000 png\n\nOriginal piece by Ismahelio.\nAugust 2022.

To me, art is about communicating ideas, ideas that sometimes fall outside of the boundaries of our normal, culturally-sanctioned model of reality. \n\nThis work is about the interconnectedness of all things. It's about the repeating patterns and echoes, both seen and unseen, that impact the world around us and our experience of it.

            "description": "All of our strong emotions, feelings and experiences come from childhood. Sincere happiness or frightening cruelty is primarily inherent in children, so they learn about the world. When we were children, we first hurt someone, first burst into tears from resentment, learned what is good and what is bad. \nOur parents did not answer our questions, either because they did not know the answer or because they thought we were too young. We learned to look for the answers ourselves. Whoever says that children don't understand is a fool. They do understand, but they do it in their own way. The world as seen through the eyes of a child is not like the world as seen through the eyes of an adult. It is often not built on the laws of physics or the laws of the marketplace. In a child's world or universe, the moon is just a little light in the sky, and the next street is already a different country. Their world is built on speculation and magical theories. Unfortunately, a child's world is not eternal. As they grow up, the \"real\" life, the life of adults, pokes into them like a sharp needle over and over again. \nThere is something incredibly tragic about this time gap between child and adult. It is this period that I wanted to trace in my work. As teenagers, it is as if we are between two trains, we are no longer children, but we are not yet adults. We get to know ourselves, we test our strength and readiness to exist in the \"real\" world. We are trying to find our place in the unfriendly world of adults, but we are also not ready to let go of the magic of childhood. It confuses, torments, and frustrates us. But it is a necessary and unavoidable tragedy. \n\nCode by PureSpider",

By contrast with other plant cultivation practices, bonsai is not intended for production of food or for medicine. Instead, bonsai practice focuses on long-term cultivation and shaping of one or more small trees growing in a container.\nI pressume that the main intention is aesthetic. The beauty. Because we love beautiful things.\nIt is very interesting how we modify certain creatures for our sake of satisfaction.\n\nMay this collection brings you good fortune.",
