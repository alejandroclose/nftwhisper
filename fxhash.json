The compositions can be chaotic and maybe even a little messy, but they also can be vibrant and diverse… which is really what this is trying to celebrate: diversity and expression.\n\nSimply, it’s about the emotions associated with whatever frees you.\n\nPlease see the linked fxtext article (on the main project page) for a more in-depth dissection of the concept. It’s less of a technical discussion, and more about the experience of the artist, and how it became linked with the feelings they associate with the art.\n\nIn live mode:\n\nFor higher resolutions, you can append “&density=2” to the url to double the size, “&density=3” to triple, and so on.\n(This is highly recommended.)\n\nTo adjust grain, you can append “&grain=##” to the url. 40 is the default, and 0 will remove it completely.",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines II. Enfantillages Pittoresques” is the second of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Enfantillages Pittoresques” experiments with predefined plots, colour blending, webgl shaders, and generative music; all with a fresh, childish style. This algorithm has been trained to draw basic shapes in accordance to Satie’s lyrics. However, it uses them in unusual ways and creates what looks like fantastic creatures, microscopic beings, or, to follow Corneille, Constant, and Appel: \"human animals\".\n\n“It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child” Attributed to Picasso (falsely, probably)\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines” are best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, these have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\nPress M or Double Tap (mobile) for AUDIO mode\nWait for SILENT mode\nPress I for Trait Info (desktop)\nPress 1 for Canvas Save (desktop)\n\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=171” after URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\nIntroduce “?pixelDensity=X” for HQ renders (standard is 2, and 8 produces 400ppi 40x44cm prints).\n\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been compressed and minified for a performance boost, but can be read fully in GitHub: https://github.com/ratchitect/\n\n\n# PERFORMANCE\nBetter experienced with Chrome.",

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background.

            "description": "### OVERVIEW ###\nThis project revisits some of the foundational ideas in my previous work \"Above (The Infinite)\" and makes them available in a parameterized form for your exploration.\n\nThis project both rewards and requires exploration. I intentionally left the parameter space very broad so that edge case configurations would be possible. In practice this means that additional curation beyond the initial random parameters will very likely be required, in a way that mimics my day to day experience as a generative artist.\n\nThanks to Karsten Schmidt for his excellent thi.ng libraries (https://thi.ng/), which form the technical foundation upon which this work was built.\n\n### CONTROLS ###\ne - Save the current frame as a PNG\nspace - Pause/Resume animation\n\n### PARAMETERS ###\nNOTE: Some combinations of parameters will cause flashing/strobing, which is why I have attached the \"Epileptic Seizure\" label to the project.\n\n* Color Palette: The color palette to apply to the output.\n* Merge Technique: The method used to combine the different patterns.\n* Patterns: The various patterns that can be combined to form the overall resulting tiled pattern.\n* Pattern Scales: The scales used to combine patterns. Higher scale values provide more visible pattern repetition.\n* Deformers: An optional additional spatial deformation of a pattern.\n* Deformer Scales: The scale of the deformation itself. Lower values use less of the deformation space, while higher values include more.\n* Detail: Acts as a filter on the visual complexity of the overall tiled pattern. Lower values will reduce visual complexity, while higher values will increase it.\n* Rotation Rate/Scroll Rates: How fast should the image rotate or scroll. Note: adjusting these parameters may result in visuals that trigger motion sickness.\n* Zoom: Lower values zoom in, higher values zoom out.\n* Round Scales Up?: When checked the pattern scales are rounded up to the nearest integer.\n* Animate?: Should some parameters be adjusted with the passing of time?\n* Low Res?: When checked, force device pixel density to 1, which reduces strain on the GPU, but may result in graphical artifacts. I usually keep this unchecked unless I want to lighten the load on the GPU.\n* Anti-alias?: When checked each pixel will be sampled multiple times to attempt to smooth out possible aliasing. This will put more load on the GPU, and will typically be slower. Can be useful when \"Low Res?\" is enabled.\n\n### HOWTO ###\nHere's how I find interesting things.\n\nFirst, I lock all of the parameters below \"Pattern 3\" at their default values. I will also usually lock both Deformers to \"Empty\", as they can sometimes hide interesting patterns while exploring, and then I experiment with enabling one or both once I have found something interesting.\n\nYou can also explore the options individually (to a certain degree) by setting other patterns to \"Empty\". This can make how patterns affect one another more obvious when you set them.\n\nAt this point I'll randomize the parameters, and then do one of the following:\n\n- If I see something that's extremely noisy/detailed, I'll turn down the \"Detail\" level, which can sometimes smooth things out.\n\n- If a tiling is very tight, I'll lower the \"Zoom\" to see more of the pattern, or the reverse if I want to see more overview.\n\n- If there's still a lot of aliasing/noise in the image, sometimes enabling anti-aliasing will help, but that will affect performance. I usually try to adjust the Scale/Detail/Zoom before resorting to anti-aliasing.\n\n- Interesting patterns are formed by the scale factors controlling how pattern overlap happens. Sometimes enabling \"Round Scales Up?\" will introduce some appealing visual symmetry.\n\n- Enable one or both of the deformers to see what impact they have on the pattern.\n\nFinally, once I've found a pattern that's interesting, I may enable scrolling or rotation. Note that enabling additional movement can increase graphical aliasing, so anti-aliasing may be required depending on the pattern.\n\nI hope you enjoy the exploration process!\n\n- Jeff Palmer\n",

            "description": "### OVERVIEW ###\nThis project revisits some of the foundational ideas in my previous work \"Above (The Infinite)\" and makes them available in a parameterized form for your exploration.\n\nThis project both rewards and requires exploration. I intentionally left the parameter space very broad so that edge case configurations would be possible. In practice this means that additional curation beyond the initial random parameters will very likely be required, in a way that mimics my day to day experience as a generative artist.\n\nThanks to Karsten Schmidt for his excellent thi.ng libraries (https://thi.ng/), which form the technical foundation upon which this work was built.\n\n### CONTROLS ###\ne - Save the current frame as a PNG\nspace - Pause/Resume animation\n\n### PARAMETERS ###\nNOTE: Some combinations of parameters will cause flashing/strobing, which is why I have attached the \"Epileptic Seizure\" label to the project.\n\n* Color Palette: The color palette to apply to the output.\n* Merge Technique: The method used to combine the different patterns.\n* Patterns: The various patterns that can be combined to form the overall resulting tiled pattern.\n* Pattern Scales: The scales used to combine patterns. Higher scale values provide more visible pattern repetition.\n* Deformers: An optional additional spatial deformation of a pattern.\n* Deformer Scales: The scale of the deformation itself. Lower values use less of the deformation space, while higher values include more.\n* Detail: Acts as a filter on the visual complexity of the overall tiled pattern. Lower values will reduce visual complexity, while higher values will increase it.\n* Rotation Rate/Scroll Rates: How fast should the image rotate or scroll. Note: adjusting these parameters may result in visuals that trigger motion sickness.\n* Zoom: Lower values zoom in, higher values zoom out.\n* Round Scales Up?: When checked the pattern scales are rounded up to the nearest integer.\n* Animate?: Should some parameters be adjusted with the passing of time?\n* Low Res?: When checked, force device pixel density to 1, which reduces strain on the GPU, but may result in graphical artifacts. I usually keep this unchecked unless I want to lighten the load on the GPU.\n* Anti-alias?: When checked each pixel will be sampled multiple times to attempt to smooth out possible aliasing. This will put more load on the GPU, and will typically be slower. Can be useful when \"Low Res?\" is enabled.\n\n### HOWTO ###\nHere's how I find interesting things.\n\nFirst, I lock all of the parameters below \"Pattern 3\" at their default values. I will also usually lock both Deformers to \"Empty\", as they can sometimes hide interesting patterns while exploring, and then I experiment with enabling one or both once I have found something interesting.\n\nYou can also explore the options individually (to a certain degree) by setting other patterns to \"Empty\". This can make how patterns affect one another more obvious when you set them.\n\nAt this point I'll randomize the parameters, and then do one of the following:\n\n- If I see something that's extremely noisy/detailed, I'll turn down the \"Detail\" level, which can sometimes smooth things out.\n\n- If a tiling is very tight, I'll lower the \"Zoom\" to see more of the pattern, or the reverse if I want to see more overview.\n\n- If there's still a lot of aliasing/noise in the image, sometimes enabling anti-aliasing will help, but that will affect performance. I usually try to adjust the Scale/Detail/Zoom before resorting to anti-aliasing.\n\n- Interesting patterns are formed by the scale factors controlling how pattern overlap happens. Sometimes enabling \"Round Scales Up?\" will introduce some appealing visual symmetry.\n\n- Enable one or both of the deformers to see what impact they have on the pattern.\n\nFinally, once I've found a pattern that's interesting, I may enable scrolling or rotation. Note that enabling additional movement can increase graphical aliasing, so anti-aliasing may be required depending on the pattern.\n\nI hope you enjoy the exploration process!\n\n- Jeff Palmer\n",

In practice this means that additional curation beyond the initial random parameters will very likely be required, in a way that mimics my day to day experience as a generative artist.\n\nThanks to Karsten Schmidt for his excellent thi.ng libraries (https://thi.ng/), which form the technical foundation upon which this work was built.\n\n### CONTROLS ###\ne - Save the current frame as a PNG\nspace - Pause/Resume animation\n\n### PARAMETERS ###\nNOTE: Some combinations of parameters will cause flashing/strobing, which is why I have attached the \"Epileptic Seizure\" label to the project.\n\n* Color Palette: The color palette to apply to the output.\n* Merge Technique: The method used to combine the different patterns.\n* Patterns: The various patterns that can be combined to form the overall resulting tiled pattern.\n* Pattern Scales: The scales used to combine patterns. Higher scale values provide more visible pattern repetition.\n* Deformers: An optional additional spatial deformation of a pattern.\n* Deformer Scales: The scale of the deformation itself. Lower values use less of the deformation space, while higher values include more.\n* Detail: Acts as a filter on the visual complexity of the overall tiled pattern. Lower values will reduce visual complexity, while higher values will increase it.\n* Rotation Rate/Scroll Rates: How fast should the image rotate or scroll. Note: adjusting these parameters may result in visuals that trigger motion sickness.\n* Zoom: Lower values zoom in, higher values zoom out.\n* Round Scales Up?: When checked the pattern scales are rounded up to the nearest integer.\n* Animate?: Should some parameters be adjusted with the passing of time?\n* Low Res?: When checked, force device pixel density to 1, which reduces strain on the GPU, but may result in graphical artifacts. I usually keep this unchecked unless I want to lighten the load on the GPU.\n* Anti-alias?: When checked each pixel will be sampled multiple times to attempt to smooth out possible aliasing. This will put more load on the GPU, and will typically be slower. Can be useful when \"Low Res?\" is enabled.\n\n### HOWTO ###\nHere's how I find interesting things.\n\nFirst, I lock all of the parameters below \"Pattern 3\" at their default values. I will also usually lock both Deformers to \"Empty\", as they can sometimes hide interesting patterns while exploring, and then I experiment with enabling one or both once I have found something interesting.\n\nYou can also explore the options individually (to a certain degree) by setting other patterns to \"Empty\". This can make how patterns affect one another more obvious when you set them.\n\nAt this point I'll randomize the parameters, and then do one of the following:\n\n- If I see something that's extremely noisy/detailed, I'll turn down the \"Detail\" level, which can sometimes smooth things out.\n\n- If a tiling is very tight, I'll lower the \"Zoom\" to see more of the pattern, or the reverse if I want to see more overview.\n\n- If there's still a lot of aliasing/noise in the image, sometimes enabling anti-aliasing will help, but that will affect performance. I usually try to adjust the Scale/Detail/Zoom before resorting to anti-aliasing.\n\n- Interesting patterns are formed by the scale factors controlling how pattern overlap happens. Sometimes enabling \"Round Scales Up?\" will introduce some appealing visual symmetry.\n\n- Enable one or both of the deformers to see what impact they have on the pattern.\n\nFinally, once I've found a pattern that's interesting, I may enable scrolling or rotation. Note that enabling additional movement can increase graphical aliasing, so anti-aliasing may be required depending on the pattern.\n\nI hope you enjoy the exploration process!\n\n- Jeff Palmer\n",
