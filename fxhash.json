            "description": "The preparations for the first mission began in 2142. It had become clear that mining petroleum on Earth would soon become financially unfeasible, so looking to other planets was the only logical choice. It took seventeen more years to perfect the technology so that the first colonists could reach Proxima b within the lifetime of one generation.\n\nAfter 45 years of travelling at almost one-tenth of the speed of light, they reached their new home. It was rich in petrochemicals but scarce in the nutrients necessary for long term human survival. After merely six generations, humanity was forced to travel once again in search of a new world. The four missions that parted from the Proxima system to colonise other possibly habitable planets in the galaxy sparked a new age of human civilisation that would never see itself united and thriving again.\n\nEventually, all the colonies became independent societies as their differing interests drove them apart. Each small civilisation chose its path, wandering the void of space alone. Over time, millions of kilometres apart, each colony developed its own culture and traditions. While their habits and customs changed, some things remained the same across all the societies, like how it became a certain tradition to convert the outer world years and days to Earth time and celebrate holidays according to the calendar of the old world.\n\nThe new nomads learned from the first pilgrims. They used the technology once optimised for oil extraction to traverse other worlds, searching for sustenance. Peculiar wandering nonspaces emerged from the involuntary degrowth of human civilisation.\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

These, combined in groups of 4, provide thousands of possible combinations. \nIn addition, these sounds will be further modified by code effects that will randomly vary their properties.\n\nClick to listen to the sounds\n\nMany thanks to @Jpupper and @Fipiaggio for help with programming the sound part and @Purespider for the template. \n\"FXHASH PFP Token Generator\" https://github.com/PureSpider/fxhash-pfp\n\nfor best resolution \"open live\" then use the \"download image\" button on the lower right corner ;)\n\n\n",

Those concrete jungles are more like giant anthills.\nPeople are interchangeable gears in one big mechanism, today you are here and tomorrow.. who knows. Tomorrow you could be gone.\n\nNew element, same functionality, you won`t find something new. Humanity is on the right path to globalization and unification. We are entitled to agreed points.\nYou can`t be who you are. Sooner or later, you`re going to have to be an interchangeable element. \nThe rules of this life have been written for you.\n\nPolina Arz ©\n\nA professional Fashion designer and fashion artist whose work reflects the spirit of modernity and the world around us in the language of current trends and contemporary art.\n\nThank you ❤",

            "description": "\"What would an ocean be without a monster lurking in the dark? It would be like sleep without dreams.\" ‒ Werner Herzog\n\nMythological monsters like Leviathan, Tiamat, and Lotan have long inspired awe and fear in people’s hearts. I was inspired by these sublime monsters and wanted to evoke their haunting and otherworldly presence.\n\nFor this project, I used creative coding techniques to simulate the methods of monotype printmaking. This medium allows for a fluid and expressive approach to art-making perfectly suited for my vision of these mythological monsters. With this work, I’m bringing these ancient legends to life in a contemporary form, exploring their enduring power and beauty by combining modern techniques with one of the oldest forms of visual art. \n\nMy goal is to arouse a sense of wonder and mystery, using color and abstract shapes to conjure up visions of these legendary monsters from the abyss. Whether you see them as terrifying beasts or beautiful creatures of legend, one thing is clear - these monsters will always remain part of our collective imagination.\n\nFeatures:\n-6 Types of Monsters (Leviathan, Lotan, Tiamat, Aspidochelone, Hydra, Charybdis)\n-3 Frame Styles (Portrait, Landscape, Square)\n-10 Color Palettes\n-Hidden Jewels of the Sea",

            "description": "Traversal is the marriage of two simple geometric ideas: a set of somewhat unruly, intersecting diagonal shapes, and a minimally reduced corner perspective that gives them depth.\n\nThe depicted bodies are entirely feasible as a 3D scene, and yet this composition is all about illusion. The hatch fill creates a perception of light. The dithering on the faces produces a sense of material texture. The squiggly lines imitate freehand drawing. The spatial perspective itself is achieved through a purely two-dimensional algorithm of polygon intersections and line hiding.\n\nThe original medium of my compositions is the pen plotter, and Traversal is no exception. It is entirely vector-based, and can be plotted directly. I use Paper.js to render it on-screen and as SVG.\n\n~\n\nTo generate and download a plottable SVG file, press `S`. Please be patient; this process can take a while. The SVG can be plotted on an A5 paper. It contains two layers visible in Inkscape, so you can plot the light grey sketch lines with a different pen, or omit them altogether.",

            "description": "Syzers is a generative synthesizer project with sounds altered by Tone JS.\n\n···· On Tuesday, May 17, unsold editions will be burned ····\n\nVisually it consists of 16 layers, in which more than 350 elements are combined randomly, generating synthesizers with unique environments and landscapes.\nAs for the sound, 40 tracks were recorded with analog synthesizers that were then assigned to each of the modules. These, combined in groups of 4, provide thousands of possible combinations. \nIn addition, these sounds will be further modified by code effects that will randomly vary their properties.\n\nClick to listen to the sounds\n\nMany thanks to @Jpupper and @Fipiaggio for help with programming the sound part and @Purespider for the template. \n\"FXHASH PFP Token Generator\" https://github.com/PureSpider/fxhash-pfp\n\nfor best resolution \"open live\" then use the \"download image\" button on the lower right corner ;)\n\n\n",
