It doesn't matter, you did it right. Your accomplishments will serve well the next generations in their journeys, in their search for themselves.\n\nNow it's time to stop, time to take a moment and contemplate the vast universe.\n\nSoon all of this will be ending.\n\nYou did it right.\n\nEmbrace the void.\n=========\n=========\n\n\n./ Color scheme (feature)\nThere are 12 color schemes and with each set, specific arrays for color collections for the space, stars, planet, and accent colors. \n\nThese are color schemes in the known universe of \"In the Edge\":\n- Mars visions\n- Cyberpunk\n- Unknown passenger \n- Renegade\n- Primary\n- Coral\n- r.e.d.\n- Machines of an ancient-future \n- The void\n- Tinted light \n- Malibu dreams\n- Atari (horrendous brown, red and yellowish combinations... I love it)\n\n./ Mountain type (feature)\nIn the Edge, you will find a mountain, and that mountain will be special, which type will you find?\n\n- Parallela insolitum\n- Sandy dunes of the truth\n- Wavy uncertainty\n- Intrinsic soul ridges\n- Cerritulus formationis\n\n./ Mountain direction (feature)\nLife is about direction... mountains too.\n\n- Left\n- Right\n- Left-Right\n\n./ Space scenery\nThis is the spicy touch, some of the iterations will have animation and others will not, giving you a clear view of the magnificent space in front of you.\n\n- Clean (NOT animated)\n- Windy planet (animated)\n- Topographic planet (animated)\n- Meteor shower (animated)\n\n./ Distance from Earth (feature)\nHow far did you go? Your travel could be from 1 lightyear to 999,999,999 lightyears (that's a lot of lights and years!). However just a few will pass the barrier of 99,999,999ly.\n\n// Additional perks\n./ Planet names \nPlanet names are unique and they are conformed by three blocks.\n\nThe first block is a conjunction between ancient Latin names and Japanese last names. \n\nThe second block takes the last three characters from the fxhash.\n\nThe third block takes three numbers from the number seed obtained from fxrand().\n\nThe planet you land will be unique, as unique as you are.\n\n// Controls\n./ Pause-Play animation\nBecause maybe (and just maybe) you want to freeze the perfect moment before closing your eyes.\n\n[Backspace] Pause.\n[Enter] Play\n\nApplies to \"Space scenery\" features windy planet, topographic planet, and meteor shower.",

            "description": "In the dreamlike landscape of our minds, the specter of fears is like a wraith, ever-present and ethereal. It whispers in our ear, reminding us of all the things we dare not face. It is a shadow that falls across our hearts, casting a pall of doubt and uncertainty. But even as it haunts us, we must remember that it is a part of us. We must learn to accept its presence, and to use it to our advantage. For fear is not always a curse, it is a guide that shows us where we must grow stronger. It is a companion that walks with us through the dark night, illuminating the path ahead. By embracing our fears, we find the courage to face them, and to overcome them. We find the strength to live fully, to love fiercely, and to pursue our dreams with abandon.\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nSpecter of Fears by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2023\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "On every important holiday of my childhood, I would return to my hometown, a village in a hilly area. The mist in the morning would have a psychedelic texture, like water ripples under the smudge of the deep blue sky. But at sunrise, the atmosphere becomes lively. All year round, spring, summer, autumn and winter, colourful and dreamlike.\n\nThe buildings in my hometown are white walls and black tiles. The fog in the village is very close to the ground, and the terrain is relatively undulating. I can often see rows of angular eaves and white walls penetrating the fog on other hillsides, like houses standing in the clouds. At that time, I always liked to climb up the hillside under the sunset after dinner, looking down at the village surrounded by clouds and mist after the rain. I could always stay at the top of the mountain and watch the clouds change from orange-red to blue. I didn't leave until the sky turned completely black. After I left the village, whenever I described such a scene with my friends, I would call such a building: Hillhouse.\n\nI'm not in China now, and I don't know when I'll be able to see the misty landscape of my hometown again to create Hillhouse, a memorial to the village that inspired my aesthetics during my childhood.\n\nI noticed many of my friends said after seeing my works that my townhouse is like a mountain. My original idea was to appropriately enlarge the proportion of the roof in the picture because I tried to balance the natural landscape and humanistic value in the work. Moreover, I also deliberately strengthened the corners and some obvious small pavilion buildings to make it different from the mountains. But, of course, art depends on personal understanding, so that's fine.\n\n\nMint at 188 tez, I will provide a 1/1 customised video NFT, physical printed work, and one WL spot for my following 2 projects on fxhash. You can choose your favourite palette and mountain style in our UI system and the soundtrack first. Then I will create a 20-sec video version NFT for you. The sound is originally created by @Dreminor. \n\nIn terms of printed work, it will be printed on museum quality acid-free paper by giclee print technique. It will never fade 100 yrs. And the printed work will have my signature and seal on it. So yes I will give it to you with no charge, except the delivery fee requested from the delivery company.\n\nI also considered secondary market transactions for collectors who minted at 188. I will offer a NEW customized video NFT and a NEW printed work to collectors who purchase the token minted in 188tez for more than 188tez on the secondary market. The video NFT is free but I will charge 100tez for the new printed work.\n\nMint at 138 tez, I will provide a printed work and one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\nMint at 64 tez. I will provide one WL spot for my next project on fxhash.\n\n\nBtw, the computational expense in this project is high, so if you cannot open live, please try to use a better computer to generate or use Visual Studio Code. If you cannot solve this problem, feel free to contact me, I would like to offer help.\n\nDue to some reasons, the preview will be different from the generative artwork. So pls open live to have a look and it will be much better than preview.\n\nThis project is created by Arctic--Cc and Van.\n",

It doesn't matter, you did it right. Your accomplishments will serve well the next generations in their journeys, in their search for themselves.\n\nNow it's time to stop, time to take a moment and contemplate the vast universe.\n\nSoon all of this will be ending.\n\nYou did it right.\n\nEmbrace the void.\n=========\n=========\n\n\n./ Color scheme (feature)\nThere are 12 color schemes and with each set, specific arrays for color collections for the space, stars, planet, and accent colors. \n\nThese are color schemes in the known universe of \"In the Edge\":\n- Mars visions\n- Cyberpunk\n- Unknown passenger \n- Renegade\n- Primary\n- Coral\n- r.e.d.\n- Machines of an ancient-future \n- The void\n- Tinted light \n- Malibu dreams\n- Atari (horrendous brown, red and yellowish combinations...

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

            "description": "In the dreamlike landscape of our minds, the specter of fears is like a wraith, ever-present and ethereal. It whispers in our ear, reminding us of all the things we dare not face. It is a shadow that falls across our hearts, casting a pall of doubt and uncertainty. But even as it haunts us, we must remember that it is a part of us. We must learn to accept its presence, and to use it to our advantage. For fear is not always a curse, it is a guide that shows us where we must grow stronger. It is a companion that walks with us through the dark night, illuminating the path ahead. By embracing our fears, we find the courage to face them, and to overcome them. We find the strength to live fully, to love fiercely, and to pursue our dreams with abandon.\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nSpecter of Fears by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2023\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",
