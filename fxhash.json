            "description": "We divide spaces into smaller spaces which we conquer and live in our solitude. We call that Metropolis.\n\nStarted this piece as a rule based generative art. Simply the algorithm takes a rectangle and throws 2 random points inside it within defined x and y distances. Then using those 2 points, algorithm draws another rectangle and assigns letters to the corners of rectangle \"A,B,C,D\" starting from top left corner in clockwise direction. Then it starts to draw cells from inner rectangle's corner A to parent's corner A and goes on. Once 4 cells are created, it creates 4 more cells in between other cells, thus dividing a rectangle into 9 pieces. This is where \"IX\" comes from. Depending on the cell properties; algorithm assigns circles, triangles, lines and points to cells creating a city scape when certain parameters are given to the division algorithm.\n\nThere are 18 possible outcomes:\n\"Hazy Day\" 13% probability (half of this style will come with slightly more color transition)\n\"Hazy Night\" 10% probability\n\"Crystal Day\" 11% probability\n\"Crystal Night\" 5% probability\n\"Mondrian Day\"  3% probability\n\"Mondrian Night\" 3% probability\n\"Bauhaus Day\" 3% probability\n\"Bauhaus Night\" 3% probability\n\"1 Chroma Day\" 4% probability (Multiple values of a single hue on a monochrome gradient)\n\"Mondrian Crystal Day\" 3% probability\n\"Mondrian Crystal Night\" 3% probability\n\"Monochrome Day\" 3% probability \n\"Monochrome Night\" 4% probability \n\"Vibrant Day\" 12% probability\n\"Vibrant Night\" 9% probability\n\"Rainbow Day' 5% probability\n\"Rainbow Night' 3% probability\n\"Chaotic Day\"   3% probability (which takes pretty random parameters and 25% of this outcome has probability of creating very first coloring style of the project, see console for the hidden feature)\n\n\n\n\nPress \"1\" to download 1000px height PNG\nPress \"2\" to download 2000px height PNG\nPress \"3\" to download 3000px height PNG\nPress \"4\" to download 4000px height PNG\nPress \"5\" to download 5000px height PNG\nPress \"6\" to download 6000px height PNG\nPress \"7\" to download 7000px height PNG\nPress \"8\" to download 8000px height PNG\nPress \"9\" to download 12000px height PNG\nPress \"m' to download 900x1600px PNG for mobile wallpaper\n\nUse CTRL+SHIFT+C or CMD+SHIFT+C to open console for hidden features\n\nCreated from scratch with p5.js \nMurat Atimtay 2022 | @atimtay | www.muratatimtay.com \n",

            "description": "The concept of 'Dualidad' (duality) is brought to life through the use of opposing elements, circles, and rectangles, in the artwork. \n\nThe circles, like the stillness of a calm pond, remain in close places while they continuously transform. In contrast, the rectangles are a representation of movement and change, constantly traveling across the canvas. \n\nThis balance of opposing elements creates a dynamic tension that draws the viewer in, leaving them mesmerized by the ever-evolving artwork. Expect to see a range of emotions, from the euphoria of joy to the depth of sorrow, as you explore the duality of this project.\n\n-----\n\nThe generative process of each artwork has a typical completion time ranging from 20 seconds to 2 minutes, depending on your PC.\n\n-----\n\nTested on Brave, Opera and Mozilla (Linux systems).

Your experience with the painting requires trust; trust that something will appear from the chaos of the empty space, trust that the composition you imagine halfway through will evolve along with your ideas, and trust that the etchings lend a helping hand to the message of the piece. You may find yourself pulled left and right when decisions are made, and your interpretation at 25%, 50%, and 90% will all differ. This is what makes creating so fulfilling to me, a work of art can change course wildly from start to finish, ever molding itself until it enters the kiln.\n\nPress ‘1’, ‘2’, or  ‘3’ to increase resolution (default is 1, higher than default may not work on certain browsers.

            "description": "This project is borne out of my longstanding fascination with brushwork, and the intricate textures that can be created with a brush, some paint and a canvas. Brush strokes are simulated using many overlapping lines and given texture and depth using a custom shader. Another important aspect of this work, is the composite forms that are created by the brush strokes, which are my attempt to emulate the emphatic energy of many abstract painters that have come before me. Color palettes are named after common paint colors, based on the background color used for the palette.\n\nThose who collect during the first tier of the Dutch Auction can claim a signed print. They will be printed on A3 Hahnemuhle Photo Rag, and shipped to the collector free of charge. More details on how to claim a print and specify the necessary shipping information will be provided via the artists twitter (@landlinesart1).\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save).

            "description": "full title: all that remains / all that, remains / all, that remains\n\nParkinson's alters one's connection to the world they inhabit. I am very glad to be able to contribute to @Cure3Exhibition's fundraising towards @CureParkinsonsT's research for potential cures with my piece, \"All that remains // all that, remains // all, that remains\". A metaphor of one's world from what others see and from the 1st person perspective, where the self remains the same but its interface with the world is distorted.\n\nOne may question who is the person. Is it the person who sees herself, or is it how it expresses and relates to its environment? Mental / cognitive illnesses affect directly this notion of self, in dramatic ways for those affected and their loved ones. This piece explores both perspectives: the appearance from outside of what the person and their difficulty is, and the appearance of the person from inside, how one perceives herself. Not by creating a literal landscape of what being struck by Parkinson's means, but painting a metaphor of distorted worlds around a person, and allowing the experiencer to remove the distorted world and focus only on the person. How do we do this? Do we actually do this? Do we do this with people affected by illnesses? Do we realize we all live in a continuous spectrum of ability/disability, that we can all someday be subject to conditions that affect our position on this axis? \n\nI have had direct contact with relatives with Parkinson's disease, as well as other central nervous system / cognitive illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease. While these are different conditions, they end up affecting in similar ways to the person living through it and their environment. I am very grateful to Artwise Curators, Bonhams, Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick for the initiative, organization and inviting me, and Cure Parkinson's for all the effort towards finding potential cures. Your work is most needed.\n\n100% of the primary sales and 100% of the royalties go to Cure Parkinson's for their efforts.\n\nThe artwork is interactive and allows the user to explore it. For instructions on how to do it, click on the artwork and press \"i\" while in live mode to download a text file with the instructions. Basic / most important interactions:\n\n- Press \"w\" to switch the view between the distorted world / the world focused on the person.\n- \"i\" to download the instructions.\n- Press \"s\" to save the current image at the current resolution.\n- Press \"l\" to obtain a different view.\n- You can alter resolution, change the view / camera position / target, and other things with the provided controls.\n- You can also specify a number of URL parameters, save the current view and other things. Please refer to the instructions.\n\nThe piece is graphics intensive and requires dedicated GPU to run properly. Tested on mid to high range GPUs on laptops and desktop computers. Will *not* work on most phones.\n\nThe piece might show a blank or noisy image if a distortion happens to fall very near to the camera. You can press \"l\" or explore with the provided commands, save the URL that defines the view and use it in future occasions.\n\nDedicated to everyone suffering from this condition, and to those working towards finding cures and improving patient's lives. Thanks.",

            "description": "This project is borne out of my longstanding fascination with brushwork, and the intricate textures that can be created with a brush, some paint and a canvas. Brush strokes are simulated using many overlapping lines and given texture and depth using a custom shader. Another important aspect of this work, is the composite forms that are created by the brush strokes, which are my attempt to emulate the emphatic energy of many abstract painters that have come before me. Color palettes are named after common paint colors, based on the background color used for the palette.\n\nThose who collect during the first tier of the Dutch Auction can claim a signed print. They will be printed on A3 Hahnemuhle Photo Rag, and shipped to the collector free of charge. More details on how to claim a print and specify the necessary shipping information will be provided via the artists twitter (@landlinesart1).\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

            "description": "A collaboration between leading British high-end audio brand KEF, generative artist hieroglyphica, and creative studio Parameta, Absorbed embodies the process of noise becoming high-fidelity sound through KEF’s Metamaterial Absorption Technology (MAT™). \n\nMAT™ makes the KEF sound what it is: absorbing unwanted distortion to deliver pure, accurate sound exactly as the artist intended. Inspired by this intricacy, Absorbed illustrates pseudorandom networks of patterns, slowly emerging and transforming into the maze-like form of MAT™. Clarity is revealed, noise is absorbed – high-fidelity is found.\n\nThe noise fields used in Absorbed are of two distinct types: conventional gradient noise and “sinusoidal” noise, an original algorithm developed for this series. The use of animation as artistic medium reflects the artists’ belief that no single frame can capture the full range of complexity found in the tension between sound and noise, and lets collectors observe for themselves this ever-shifting dialogue. A more extensive discussion of the algorithms used in Absorbed can be found in hieroglyphica’s companion article on fx(text).\n\n- spacebar will pause and resume the animation\n- s will save a still image of the current frame\n- technically minded collectors can consult the index.html file for info on how to render and save high-resolution images\n- use of hardware acceleration in Chrome may impact performance\n\nFounded by BBC engineer Raymond Cooke in 1961, KEF is a leading British innovator of high-end audio products including HiFi speakers, subwoofers, architectural speakers, wireless speaker-systems, and headphones.

In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\nSitting under acacia trees in some full moon warm summer nights inspired the \"September Mond\" work.\n\nProject link: http://lumicon.de/e-art/project/septembermond/\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND\n",

            "description": "ASCII-SCAPE\n\nLike for many others growing up during the 1980s & 90s, my very first hands-on encounter with actual computer graphics (outside of games) was in the form of \"textmode\" and its various alphanumeric characters and other symbols available on the 8bit home computers of that period. These machines were perfectly capable of producing fairly high-resolution & multi-color graphics (all relative), yet most systems booted into an interactive prompt with the so-called textmode as de-facto standard environment, providing a level, if also limited, playing field for the creation of text-based graphics from a patchwork of characters & symbols of a predefined font (system or custom). As is so often the case, limitation is the mother of invention and the regular, monospaced grid and standardized set of characters quickly encouraged an entire subculture of specialized designers & artists to emerge (which is currently being re-discovered & remixed by younger generations), applying & showcasing their creativity (with often surprisingly ingenious skills) in the form of game designs, user interfaces, disk mags, demoscene productions, competitions, flyers, BBSes and even various early Web designs of the mid/late 90s.\n\nASCII-SCAPE is an attempted non-nostalgic homage to these roots & culture. It is also a textmode-only (no canvas!) rework of my previous piece C-SCAPE. It combines my love of cellular automata with the stripped back aesthetics & limitations of using only text as representation medium of these co-evolving generative systems. It required an almost complete rewrite & re-curation of various elements: 1200+ new handpicked rule combinations, 32 character sets, 40 color themes, new relationships & biases to better manage the resulting textures, densities and contrast.\n\nAlthough technically not strictly \"ASCII\" (an actual standard, but also a popular shorthand for \"text only\"), the entire simulation only uses various Unicode characters and the beautiful Iosevka open source typeface by Renzhi Li aka Belleve Invis.\n\nLike its parent C-SCAPE, this project is dynamic and evolves indefinitely. It's best viewed on non-mobile devices, where there's a decent horizontal resolution to provide sufficient simulation space. Please see the C-SCAPE project description for further details. There's no graphical export feature, but output can be captured into an UTF-8 plain text file (max. 100k lines/generations).\n\nThe following keyboard shortcuts are available:\n\n- space : toggle simulation updates (pause/play)\n- r : randomize environment\n- x : start/stop recording\n- f : toggle scroll speed (fast/slow)\n\nLicense\n\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n\nIosevka typeface licensed under OFL-1.1 license\n\nhttps://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka\n\nDisclaimer\n\nMinting this project will not guarantee inclusion in access lists for future projects.\n\nCredits\n\nMade in 2022 with <3 and https://thi.ng",

            "description": "NEBELWALD is the first series of about 10 different tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years. \n\nThis project explores a minimalist approach to tree naturalism using a recursive algorithm and includes three traits: a density layer of fog, a measure of tree growth, and the softness of snowfall.\n\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png.\n\nArtist notes:\n\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nOnce I experienced it in a dense fog, which was amazing! beautiful and mysterious at the same time. This has definitely inspired the NEBELWALD work series.\n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: http://lumicon.de/e-art/project/nebelwald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND\n",
