            "description": "Barrage (/bəˈrɑʒ/ french for dam) is a project that proposes a narrative by invoking a game of radical composition. The program traverses a texture, searching for gaps in depth. When it identifies deep areas, it will draw lines, and when they are high, it will write text. The texture will then define the width and height of the letters and the direction of the lines. \n\nRandomly for each edition, the text will be written vertically or horizontally, but it will always be repeated, becoming a kind of incantation, a statement that is repeated endlessly while awaiting the intervention of a higher power, but also like an instruction in code that will be executed a certain number of times or until a condition is met.\n\nTextures and texts hybridize, the text is no longer flat but in motion, altered by a Perlin noise that renders it illegible in places and, at other times, enlarged, dominating the rest of the composition. Like an elocution, the text now has a rhythm, its acceleration and its hollows: it comes alive.\n\n___\n\nClick on the edition to generate an image (PNG) or a vector (SVG).\n\nYou are free to plot your edition by your own and if you want a signed edition you can use the great feature \"reedemable\" of fxhash to order a small (A4) or a large (A3) plotter drawing of your edition.\n\nProject setup with thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nUsing thi.ng/umbrella, nclslbrn/plotter-writer and simplex-noise packages.\n\n2024 Nicolas Lebrun",

            "description": "Timeless... a word that makes time indescribable. I want to talk about that point in space and time that seems endless, where past, present, and future are intertwined. In a space where endless time and rivers flow, without beginning and without end, always flowing and at the same moment, not recorded and not forgotten. In the period when the earth speaks of itself with a call of love and passion in every moment of life. When the heart sinks into the past, each emotion has its people. Here, feelings, thoughts, and ideas shine in an endless beam of time, each drop of which has a deep immersion in the vast sea of the past and experiences. A place where borders are erased and people connect with the earth. That bright spot in time and place reminds us that we are all part of a bigger story. Events that are connected from beginning to end are always ongoing and have eternity and beauty. From thousands of years ago until today, nature has shown endless displays of its special beauty. I want to talk about its sedimentary textures and its various colors, signs of an infinite path of time, and natural changes that have affected it, and each piece of it tells a mysterious story of its journey through time; From its formation in the depths of the seas and rivers to the emergence on the surface of the earth. A natural miracle, which, with its beauty, draws us to a world of greatness and wonder. Grooves that scream from the depths of time remind us that everything in this world is an infinite and beautiful journey, and we are part of this great world.\nPerhaps it is a symbol of beauty and stability in the stone world. Wonders that tell us about the distant past. It begins when the universe began to form and continues to this day. This geological formation, which was formed millions of years ago, is a masterpiece of earth maps that takes us to distant, complicated, and adventurous times. Textures of sedimentary rocks that preserve their beauty and special patterns tell a story of the journey of nature's superpower. Thin layers of blue, green, and red stones, make a valuable past for us; From water currents, solar eclipses, and deep underground fun.\nAnd finally, I conclude that the earth is an infinite museum of beauty and history. Each layer of this formation tells us a new chapter of the greatness of the world. A story that continues to this day and always fascinates us by watching his works.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

This allows for a multitude of possible forms, and each iteration is an artifact to be discovered within the multidimensional space.\n\nThis work is focused around discovery. It is about exploring the space of the algorithm, shedding light on its many forms, and sometimes finding artifacts of the real world embedded within them.\n\nTechnically, this work is a composition of three primary elements: Voronoi tessellations, orthographic projection, and the depth-sort algorithm.\nThe latter of these is integral to the rendering mechanism. It works intuitively, drawing distant objects before near objects, evaluating the distance of each object according to its geometric center. It does this precisely, and in doing so, it can produce interesting visual artifacts, drawing some shapes in an unexpected order.\n\n\n\nThis has been a fascinating study, bringing light to unreal shapes and forms, and uncovering artifacts in an impossible space.\n\nI hope you enjoy it,\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Notes:\n- Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done.",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

The organism starts with a few seed nodes, and it grows when the seed nodes and search nodes accept each other when they meet certain conditions. The organism loosely resembles structures found in nature such as coral reef or fungus. Do we embrace the beauty of its emerging structure or reject it because of pathogenic associations?  \n  \nInstructions:\n  - The simulation may take some time to finish.\n  - press [spacebar] - start/stop breathing animation\n  - press [b] - alternative grey backgrounds\n  - press [s] - export high resolution PNG image\n  - press [p] - play or pause the entire animation\n  - real time growth mode - You can simulate the growth in real-time by adding \"realtime\" parameter to the end of the URL in live view.

            "description": "According to Kandinsky, painting “can create the same energies in the observer that music can make in the listener. The abstract painter is an echo seeker: just like the relationship between music and the listener, shapes and colors must penetrate the observer's soul. They vibrate the threads of his existence and resonate in the depths of his mind, you can still find references to people, buildings, mountains, etc., but these are more signs than manifestations. They do not evoke objects but abstractly reveal them, like the simplified image we have seen before of objects and elements in nature.\nClassical philosophy reinforces the belief that existing, tangible reality is a mask for a deeper reality that can only be reached through imagination. I have tried to combine this with the art of coding and creating canvases of millions of characters and numbers.\nMade in p5js\nCreated July 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",
