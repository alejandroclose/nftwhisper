            "description": "GuilCity is the beginning of an exciting journey bringing Guillaume Cornet’s densely-packed cities into the generative realm with the help of Matthew’s (@frostbitten’s) magic touch.\n\nMatthew—with his background in coding and animation—enables a new opportunity to experience these cities like never before. Numerous elements from vehicles to characters and even architecture have been given life. Interact with the city (computer mouse only): poke and peek around (even behind) in this active search & find journey! \n\nEach generative city fills the composition with the type of whimsical, expressive elements and characters you’ve come to know Guil for. What kinds of wacky features have you discovered yet?\n\n—\n\nThe tech behind this project utilizes the highly compressed WEBP image format in order to provide so many full-color options. This format is great, but unfortunately Safari on desktop/laptop must be upgraded to at least version 14 and macOS to at least version 11 Big Sur to use it.\n\nThe animation system for this project was created from scratch with additional help from the PIXI.js library for individual mesh animations.\n\n—\n\nTo find out more about your GuilCity, copy your unique operation hash and place it at the end of the following url:\n• https://my.guil.city?fxhash=\n(for example: https://my.guil.city?fxhash=ooezL8cffNJGSc4TfNQp3u3WnDpkg8J3zFRczLuumceoYU5QYPs)\n\n—\n\n\nThe entire process has been a learning experience for both of us, adapting and exploring the many possibilities to interact with each others’ skills and ideas.\n\nWe really enjoyed building this project together and are excited as we invite you to take a dive into your very own urban playground!\n\nMerci à tous! Cheers!\n  - Guillaume Cornet, Matthew Seremet",

            "description": "\nIn 2021, I enrolled in a course about Genius, Inspiration, and Madness across ancient, European, and American traditions. A central theme of the course was a recurrent exploration of the Apollonian-Dionysian dichotomy described by Nietzsche in his seminal work \"The Birth of Tragedy\". Nietzsche contrasts the Apollonian (order, structure, rationality) with the Dionysian (chaos, emotion, primal nature) and suggests the interplay between these two drives is essential for creating profound art, reflecting the complexity of human nature. \n\nFor me, this study extended beyond academic curiosity. It reshaped my perspective, elevating a concept I was superficially familiar with into a recurring theme I observed in my life or applied in my artistic pursuits.\n\n\"Appearance and Being\" (Schein und Sein) aims to build upon the explorations of my previous works, \"Sol\" and \"Space & Ego,\" effectively serving as a third installment in an ongoing study. The series uses handpicked cellular automata rules at a close-up, through which I consciously navigate the space between strict structure and organic unpredictability. I start with a rudimentary, perfectly square form distorting it to the point of obtuseness. The ironically sharp edges of these obtuse elements, juxtaposed against a fading, concealed underlying structure, balance authenticity and aesthetics.\n\nAll works are designed with plottability in mind, aiming to convey solids, stripes, and gradients through lines.\n\nRecommended pen tips for plotting are:\n\nSolid iterations: 0.4mm (size 04), but also works across a range of pens.\nStriped iterations: 0.4mm (size 04), but also works across a range of pens.\nGradient iterations: 0.2mm (size 005), also works with smaller sizes. \n\nOne rare color palette combination was inspired by a wonderful book I discovered at my local library - Edith Young's \"Color Scheme.\" The book offers many different palettes across a diverse set of subjects. From these, I selected and merged two favorites to create a two-color palette - The Pupils of the eyes in Vermeer's portraits (1656-72) and The reds of the red caps in Renaissance portraits (1460-1535).  \n\nImplemented in JS, this code utilizes the Perlin.js and Simple-noise.js libraries.\n\nPress p to save a PNG of the image in full screen. Press s to save a single complete SVG file for plotting.\n\nAnd this is a redeemable project in case you’d like to receive a physical plot!\n\nPixel Love!",

            "description": "The idea of Doodlescapism was born from memories of being a kid in school, doodling strange things on the last pages of a maths notebook, sitting in the back of a classroom during a long, long, boring lesson. The mind, ever-restless, sought refuge in the margins of learning - a clandestine world where geometric oddities forming strange matter clusters came to life.\n\nKnowledge of the only basics of perspective rules and a few of the simplest geometric forms can’t stop the children’s creativity. Moreover, it encourages them to use and master it over and over again, transforming doodles into hyperbolically primitivistic worlds, where cubes and spheres become leading actors in endless stories.\n\nPalettes are simple and saturated, such as a box of pencils and pens. Layers of lines appear one by one, adding details to the previous drawing or changing its appearance completely, like a kid who decides to change the whole plot entirely in the middle of the story. The generative art medium acts as a true allegory of children’s endless creativity, making unique iterations one after another while there is a spot of ink in your pens.\n\nMade with love and p5js.\nThe code of this artwork is dimension-agnostic.\n\nControls in fullscreen:\n[1] - save PNG at the current resolution\n[2] - save PNG 8000  x  5332\n[3] - save PNG 12000 x  7998",

            "description": ">>> GAN ⫷glitch⫸ Ting Xu |  幹亭序 <<<\n\n• Generative glitch collage: More than simply a + b + c •\n\n\nAt the apex of Chinese calligraphy, Lantingji Xu, the preface, was written by the most renowned calligrapher in China, Wang Xizhi (王羲之).\n\nDuring the Spring Purification Ceremony, forty-two literati gathered along the banks of a coursing stream and engaged in a \"winding stream\" drinking contest: cups of wine were floated on the water upstream, and whenever a cup stopped in front of a guest, they had to compose a poem or otherwise drink the wine. At the end of the day, twenty-six literati composed thirty-seven poems in total and the Lantingji Xu, as a preface to the collection, was produced by Wang on the spot.\n\nIn the GTX collection, we create new intricate and expressive relationships between ink, paper, and pixels using Jimi's raw calligraphy work, their GAN offsprings, and Thomas's CHX-like glitch processing, generating unique calligraphy on mint and toasting at the same time.\n\n\nHow it works:\n\nCombining sets of raw layers that range from paintings, calligraphy, and GAN seeds, our algorithm applies an array of image processing magic, creating intricate novel outputs.\n\nWe have 102 raw layers separated into four groups. Each final output is formed by mixing and processing four randomly selected layers. \n\nGroup 1 contains textures, and it is composed of Jimi's paintings, GAN seeds from mixed custom models, and CLIP Guided Diffusions. \n\nGroup 2 contains Jimi's calligraphy work. \n\nGroup 3 contains GAN calligraphy seeds from custom models we trained on Jimi's body of work. \n\nGroup 4 contains digital grain textures.\nOur algorithm starts by selecting one layer from each group, assigning them sizes, opacities, orientations, and other parameters. Then it sets a dithering combination to be applied. We have eight combos formed by combining seven different custom dithering algorithms (3 at a time). \n\nAfter each dither gets applied to its corresponding layer, images get mixed using different blend modes to help combine them in fun ways. Afterwards, a couple more filters get applied to glue everything together. When all is said and done, final artworks get rendered onto the canvas.\n\nSit back, open the live view, and enjoy. \n\n\nAppreciate the art, not the speculation. Pay what you can. \n\nWith love, sweat, and tears –drops– \nJimi and Thomas.\n\n\nJimi's notes:\n\nI provided the calligraphy representing the extreme spectrum of my expression in brushwork and poetry. I also evaluated the GAN calligraphy outputs, helping Thomas hone the models. During the training process I was horrified and in awe by both the stupidity and sometimes brilliance of the GANs.\n\nThrough the layering techniques developed by Thomas, I have also gained new insights into calligraphy, taking it beyond brush, ink and paper. The spectrum of expression in calligraphy gets freed from traditional constraints in GTX. Fx(hash) calligraphy has become brush, code and screen. \n\nThomas does not read Chinese, but I was happy to let him crop my scrolls into square layers in ways he saw fit with the project's aesthetic. To my surprise, I did not only agree with his visual choices but also noticed how the illiterate crops had many Freudian slips. That is, my poetry made sense fractally. I think this is no coincidence for calligraphers that write their poetry. Calligraphy is more than the sum of beautiful brushstrokes and also greater than the sum of pretty characters. Calligraphy is the composition of space and semantics. Only in turn does meaning takes its place in parts of calligraphy. \n\n\nControls:\n[s] save as PNG.\n\n\nPaint / Ink / Photography –> GANs / Diffusions –> p5.js –> Blockchain\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2022 Thomas Noya and Jimi Wen\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n◉_◉ ◉_◉",

It is recommended that you view the work in 4K or 6K to appreciate the finer details. \n\nThe keyboard buttons: “2”, “4”, and “6” can be pressed to change the resolution to 2K, 4K and 6K resolution accordingly. \n\nTo download an image at its current resolution, press the keyboard button “S”.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtwork created with p5.js\n\n@nbswwit\nSept 2022\n",

            "description": "Audiovisual generative artwork. \n\nIn the interpretation of biological organisms, which break paradigms by doing something different, to adapt to changes and be able to survive, paths emerge to be imitated by so many, and make life flow. The development of the work is a metaphor for those paths full of ingenuity and risk, where colorful organisms in rows open trails, sliding like subtle drops, with sophisticated turns and elastic jumps.\n\nSome alternative paths usually hide a message along the way. Literally, one could find and read phrases in relation to biodiversity and its importance. Although it is more common to ignore them, sometimes not respect them, or what is worse, forget them. Even so, in an exacerbated insistence, here, audiovisual organizations seem to be repeating themselves, “until biodiversity rains”, and variety exploits so that ecosystems finally go it alone.\n\n\nRelationship between visuals and sounds:\nBiological organisms of different colors follow a path. They move forward, change shape, stop, turn. Always one after the other. At certain moments, they stretch and jump and sounds emerge.\n\nTowards the edges of the canvas, the jumps are translated into cello sounds, mainly pizzicatos. Towards the center, the piano. From the main jumps emerges a kind of melody played by a pseudo-theremin-synth, characterized by flyaway melodies with glissant.\n\n\nThis artwork is 100% code, made in p5.js + tone.js.\n\n[ Click ]  -> sound ON / OFF\n[ s ] -> save 2160x2160px (in live view)\n[ f ] -> fullscreen\n[ p ] -> pause / play \n\nNote: This artwork is an animated piece, and requires a powerful GPU for optimal real-time playback. It is important to note that it may not run properly on mobile devices, especially not high-end ones.\nIt is recommended to run the piece in a new window from the “open” button.",
