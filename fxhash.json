            "description": "Back when I was a researcher at a human-computer interaction lab, I parked in the adjacent neighborhood and rode the city bus into campus.\n\nUsually this was a pretty uneventful affair.\n\nOne spring day though, the bus was packed and I had to stand right up front by the driver. Despite trying to appear busy enough not to be bothered, the driver struck up a conversation.\n\nAt some point in the short trip, we stopped at a red light. It was then that he made an off-hand comment that I've remembered ever since.\n\nâThe moment between when the light turns green and when I realize it, thatâs where my soul resides.â\n\nIâm not sure how youâre supposed to respond to that. But nevertheless it smacked me.\n\nSo: do not consider each of these my personal signature as an artist, developer, and tinkerer.\n\nDo consider them an expended shard of my soul and the culmination of experiences that have led up to this moment.\n\nThis is the light turning green.\n\n---\n\nTHIS TOKEN IS A RESERVE PASS (itâs â¨specialâ¨)\n\n- This token will function as a reserve pass for any future drop on fx(hash) that has a total edition size of > 100 (ie, most of my drops, other than dedicated âsketchâ projects that may have intentionally fewer editions)\n\n- Future reserves will be limited to holders of this token, and holding this token will guarantee you a dedicated 24 hour reserve spot on such projects.\n\n- Holding any token from my prior projects will make you eligible to mint from this drop (I will take a final snapshot ~1 hr prior to drop).\n\n- I have created an edition size of 60, but only 40 will be open for minting at this time. Iâll reserve the remainder for issuing or burning at my discretion.\n\n- I will also airdrop ~9 editions to the top collectors of my previous projects (consider Twitter to be the source of info on this prior to the drop)\n\nWHY?\n\nI donât like the idea of picking and choosing who gets a reserve and who doesnât.\n\nI love you all ð\n\n---\n\n- Made with p5JS\n- Press âsâ to save png",

            "description": "AERO\n\nIn the stillness of the void, floating cities hang suspended, bound by no earthly gravity. The buildings, wrought in shades of dreamy pastels, appear as though they have been plucked from some other time and place, and set adrift in a new and unknowable realm.\n\nHere, amidst the stillness and silence, ropes hang loosely like vines, connecting the structures in a delicate web of possibility. The architecture of the buildings is vaguely familiar, yet strangely surreal, hinting at a past now forgotten.\n\nAs the eye wanders through this landscape of suspended structures, a feeling of nostalgia begins to seep in. There is a sense that these cities were once inhabited, bustling with the energy of human life. Now, they stand alone, abandoned and forgotten, as nature slowly reclaims its territory.\n\n\n\nThe AERO series explores how a minimalistic set of shapes and rules can be extrapolated to create complex assemblies, the same way individual buildings will form villages and cities.\n\nTo add a sense of organic texture to these geometric structures, ropes that connect certain squares have been added. They can sometimes take on the appearance of vines. This addition aims creates a sense of tension between the man-made and the natural.\n\n\n\nDouble click or double tap to save the current image\n\nIn fullscreen mode / live view:\nAdd \"&size=xxxx\" at the end of the url to generate a custom sized image\nAdd \"&clean\" at the end of the url to remove the grain effect\n\n\nArtist: Estienne\nFeb. 2023\nLicense: NFT 2.0",

Van Doesburg has outgrown his age with his works. 100 years later his works regains its relevance by extend this experience into 3-dimensional space displayed by computers.\n\nHave fun and build! :)\n\n@C4RC0 Â© 2022\nhttps://carco.hu",

The hatch fill creates a perception of light. The dithering on the faces produces a sense of material texture. The squiggly lines imitate freehand drawing. The spatial perspective itself is achieved through a purely two-dimensional algorithm of polygon intersections and line hiding.\n\nThe original medium of my compositions is the pen plotter, and Traversal is no exception. It is entirely vector-based, and can be plotted directly. I use Paper.js to render it on-screen and as SVG.\n\n~\n\nTo generate and download a plottable SVG file, press `S`. Please be patient; this process can take a while. The SVG can be plotted on an A5 paper. It contains two layers visible in Inkscape, so you can plot the light grey sketch lines with a different pen, or omit them altogether.",

The buildings, wrought in shades of dreamy pastels, appear as though they have been plucked from some other time and place, and set adrift in a new and unknowable realm.\n\nHere, amidst the stillness and silence, ropes hang loosely like vines, connecting the structures in a delicate web of possibility. The architecture of the buildings is vaguely familiar, yet strangely surreal, hinting at a past now forgotten.\n\nAs the eye wanders through this landscape of suspended structures, a feeling of nostalgia begins to seep in. There is a sense that these cities were once inhabited, bustling with the energy of human life. Now, they stand alone, abandoned and forgotten, as nature slowly reclaims its territory.\n\n\n\nThe AERO series explores how a minimalistic set of shapes and rules can be extrapolated to create complex assemblies, the same way individual buildings will form villages and cities.\n\nTo add a sense of organic texture to these geometric structures, ropes that connect certain squares have been added. They can sometimes take on the appearance of vines. This addition aims creates a sense of tension between the man-made and the natural.\n\n\n\nDouble click or double tap to save the current image\n\nIn fullscreen mode / live view:\nAdd \"&size=xxxx\" at the end of the url to generate a custom sized image\nAdd \"&clean\" at the end of the url to remove the grain effect\n\n\nArtist: Estienne\nFeb. 2023\nLicense: NFT 2.0",

            "description": "SCHNEEWALD is the second release in a row of about 12 tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years.\n\nThis project explores an approach to trees with snow using a recursive algorithm and includes Three traits: a density layer for the amount of trees and another layer for the amount snow and a third for how strong the branches bend.\n\nRendering progress indicated on the top left border\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png\n\nArtist notes:\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nI experienced it in all sorts of seasonal change, packed with snow is definitely among the most amazing! \n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: https://e-art.co/project/schneewald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright Â© 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND",

            "description": "AERO\n\nIn the stillness of the void, floating cities hang suspended, bound by no earthly gravity. The buildings, wrought in shades of dreamy pastels, appear as though they have been plucked from some other time and place, and set adrift in a new and unknowable realm.\n\nHere, amidst the stillness and silence, ropes hang loosely like vines, connecting the structures in a delicate web of possibility. The architecture of the buildings is vaguely familiar, yet strangely surreal, hinting at a past now forgotten.\n\nAs the eye wanders through this landscape of suspended structures, a feeling of nostalgia begins to seep in. There is a sense that these cities were once inhabited, bustling with the energy of human life. Now, they stand alone, abandoned and forgotten, as nature slowly reclaims its territory.\n\n\n\nThe AERO series explores how a minimalistic set of shapes and rules can be extrapolated to create complex assemblies, the same way individual buildings will form villages and cities.\n\nTo add a sense of organic texture to these geometric structures, ropes that connect certain squares have been added. They can sometimes take on the appearance of vines. This addition aims creates a sense of tension between the man-made and the natural.\n\n\n\nDouble click or double tap to save the current image\n\nIn fullscreen mode / live view:\nAdd \"&size=xxxx\" at the end of the url to generate a custom sized image\nAdd \"&clean\" at the end of the url to remove the grain effect\n\n\nArtist: Estienne\nFeb. 2023\nLicense: NFT 2.0",

            "description": "RAUSCH is a series of generative artworks that explore imaginary digital architectures. \n\nThis series challenges traditional notions of architectural representation and raises important questions about the role of resolution in design. Just as the pixel resolution of an image affects its perceived quality, the resolution of an architectural space can affect its qualities and livability. By embracing digital variation through codes, this series explores the interplay between abstract and concrete space through multiple resolutions. \n\nRAUSCH is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by complex, chaotic and messy sensations, and aims to engage the viewer through a sense of wonder, disorientation, and awe.\n\nReleased on the occasion of Companions of Code, a group exhibition by VerticalCrypto Art at The NFT Gallery in London. \nCurated by Micol Ap.
