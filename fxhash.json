But ultimately, you have to face them, unless you enjoy living in their shadow. \n\n___\nInspirations\n\nI’ve never truly realized that, but ever since I remember, the sight of gigantic objects or creatures evoked strong emotions within me.\nIt probably started with playing Shadow of Colossus (a video game) as a kid and seeing The Cathedral (short movie by Tomasz Bagiński). Years later, reading Solaris (by Stanisław Lem) aroused the same feeling (among others) of being mesmerized by the vastness. More recently, movies like Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival (which also nudged my attraction to mystery) and Dune - have charmed me.\n\nEarlier this year I have stumbled across Dawid Planeta (artist and yoga teacher) and began contemplating his visions of mini people in the jungle inhabited by giant animals.

            "description": "Illusion City reflects the variety of Istanbul by its different and divergent zones, day and night, humid summers and ice cold winters, colorful neighborhoods and giant plazas, its never ending human and vehicle traffic.\n\nThis series is an expression of how we experience this city, kind of like a love and hate relationship. The city that is a cradle of civilizations now has become a concrete jungle. Our beautiful city and its citizens are now trying to find their own balance in this state of chaos.\n\nWe wanted to express these complex emotions with a long-form generative artwork since it is the most suitable medium to explore every possible combination of emotions we have about our city. \n\nBest experienced in full screen.\n\nProbabilities;\n\n- 3 pre-made color palettes, 1 generative color palette\n\n- 3 blend modes\n\n- 3 topping placements\n\n- 8 different particle angle compositions\n\n- Several grid sizes and edges\n\n- An intentionally kept in glitch (rare)\n\nIn live mode, press ‘s’ to save as .png (2000 x 2666 px )\n\nIt can take up to a minute to render or longer in low-performance computers. Enjoy the process!\n\nMade with p5.js\n\nIlgın İçözü, July 2022\n@distcollective\n",

            "description": "\"Bored Computer Screen\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Art Basel, Basel 2022\n\n\nBored Computer Screen (BCS) is a direct descendant of Specter👻pixel⬛latte☕, where the central idea is agent and displacement. In BCS, there are agents—the small moving circles—that get their colors ripped away by the surrounding pixels. Though they occur on the same screen space, they are separated in their own cells, a simultaneous multiverse of sorts. In some iterations, a very clear voronoi pattern will appear. I didn't consciously strive for this look. It's what naturally happens, when you try to divide space, so that the borders occur exactly in between the closest neighbor. When I first saw this pattern emerge, I wanted to see how far I could get the distinct cells to influence each other. The idea that the same algorithmic processes can happen many times but still separately in a single piece has always interested me (and explored in the Infinite Browse series). BCS is an extension of that, albeit a little more chaotic.\n\nNote:\n- Best experience on browsers and devices with support for WebGL2 \n\nMade by Sam Tsao (@sam___tsao) with P5, P5Fbo and perlinjs.\n",

They had different layers with colorful textures and crystal structures. All of them caught my curiosity and my time after school.\n\nIn this project, I try to remember and describe my experience about beautiful stones and gems with abstract arts. Four types of layouts are designed and each with a recursive algorithm to construct the crystal structures. Five textures are picked to mimic the complex patterns inside of crystal cells. All above them are combining in a random way, but are balanced with local structures.\n\nVariables:\n- 4 layouts\n- 5 textures\n- 20 color sets\n\nPlease be patient with drawing process.",
