            "description": "\n\n\n\nIn Argentina there is a very young and talented music producer called BIZARRAP.\n\nHe is very famous for the BZRP Music Sessions, which are tracks in collaboration with international artists that Bizarrap produces in his studio, which also serves as a recording studio for the official video clip of the track.\n\nIn these sessions the artists have the freedom to express themselves in ways that perhaps the industry doesn't allow them because they have an image to sell, or the freedom to deliver whatever they want.\n\nFor example, in the Music Session with Nicky Jam, the Puerto Rican artist sings rap in Spanish, English and reggaeton, all in the same song.\n\nInspired by this concept I decided to launch my CR Art Sessions format. The idea is to take previous works and reconvert them or give me the freedom to play with the algorithms and explore new options and parameters to reach their limits or to obtain something different but with the same essence.\n\nThe CR Art Sessions //1 is based on my first fx(hash) project called Geoetris. \n\nThe same algorithm was slightly modified to produce 3 different types of art that the user will be able to visualize. \n1. The first type is an extreme version of the Geoetris project, where the parameters were modified to have blend between the pieces and generate many more elements on screen. \n2. The second is a composition of circles and squares, where there is a very simple rule that can only sometimes be broken and that is that the rectangles start in the middle of the circle. \n3. The third is a version where the larger geometric shapes are not filled and only their silhouette is marked.\n\n-----\n\nReserves: All 'Geoetris' owners and 40-40 slots for 'Yo automata' and 'Isomeric Doppelgangers' owners\n\n-----\n\nRoyalties: 50% to minter\n\n-----\n\nControls:\n\nExplore each art variant with the '1', '2', '3' keys\n\nThe 'e' key exports the current canvas\n\nThe 's' key exports the image in 3200x4000 px resolution\n\n-----\n\nArtwork by @cristianrohr (2022)\n\nMade with P5js and <3.",

            "description": "In the dreamlike landscape of our minds, the specter of fears is like a wraith, ever-present and ethereal. It whispers in our ear, reminding us of all the things we dare not face. It is a shadow that falls across our hearts, casting a pall of doubt and uncertainty. But even as it haunts us, we must remember that it is a part of us. We must learn to accept its presence, and to use it to our advantage. For fear is not always a curse, it is a guide that shows us where we must grow stronger. It is a companion that walks with us through the dark night, illuminating the path ahead. By embracing our fears, we find the courage to face them, and to overcome them. We find the strength to live fully, to love fiercely, and to pursue our dreams with abandon.\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nSpecter of Fears by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2023\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

Each artist has 5 Artworks in this collection, which have been randomly combined with Borders that I designed (Morteza Yousefi, idea owner and art director)\nI designed the borders in such a way that by combining them, we find Unique borders that can be minimal or complex, or abstract.\n\nThis combination has got a beautiful effect in a random way, and besides that, this collection is very valuable because of the reputation and Ideas of the 25 artists and the Collaboration of 25 Artists.\n\nThe number of Traits in this collection is 7 (176 layers) and it has the ability to make 60,963,840 unique NFTs.\n\nTo create balance, these NFTs are randomly minted, and this is a chance for everyone to get a rare version. So due to the low price of these NFTs, if the rare version did not belong to you, it is still possible for you to mint the new NFTs.\n\nTo Produce this collection, all the layers were designed pixel by pixel, which was time-consuming and difficult. And this greatly increases the value of this collection.\n\n🟧🟦🟧🟧\n\nTwitter: @Morixels\n\nWebsite: https://morixels.com/\n\nMade in 2023\n\n🟧🟦🟧🟧\n\nCollaborators Twitter :\n@Morteza_Yousefy\n@ShagaONhan\n@PixeliusArt\n@ardavan_\n@Bonyvxl\n@mo0n_zi\n@Alireza_f_z\n@negar_khozhandi\n@MontazeriAmin\n@Gunnwik1\n@_iaM_Mina\n@mahdirezafathi\n@rishehri_h\n@ma_khalaji\n@Rezvan_jj\n@v_valimohammadi\n@nillgraphic\n@tsaibaba88\n@HeleDesignnft\n@iSteef\n@Raven_slb\n@marzieh_fazeli\n@borok_studio\n@ehsan_special\n@happyfamily1985\n\n",

            "description": "The story behind this collection is that there isn't really a story behind this collection. It is the result of play, tinkering, and curiosity.\n\nOne of the beautiful things about generative art is how we can achieve drastically different results simply by modifying a few parameters or lines of code. As my first release here on fxhash was 'Sabler', it felt fitting that my release for #fxhashturnsone would itself be a modified version of that 'Sabler' algorithm, albeit giving drastically different results.\n\nIt is notable for the fact that this is perhaps my most 'chaotic' collection yet, letting go of carefully considered proportions, angles and positioning and here leaving that in the hands of the computer. In a way, this simple act represents several design decisions I never would have imagined myself making a year ago, highlighting my growth as a generative artist over the past year.\n\nIt is also a reflection of the inspiration gained from many of the artists and boundary-pushers in the space that each time unlock and encourage creations beyond the immediate comfort zone. For that, this is a 'Thank You' to all of you.\n\nWith that, here's to many more years of generative beauty and inspiration on fxhash and beyond.\n\nAs with previous collections, I highly recommend viewing the images at full size and savouring the details and the chaos up close. Pressing 'S' will save a 6000 x 6000 px PNG file.\n\n50% of primary sales will be donated to the Processing Foundation.",
