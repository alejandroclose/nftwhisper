            "description": "\"Bored Computer Screen\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Art Basel, Basel 2022\n\n\nBored Computer Screen (BCS) is a direct descendant of Specter👻pixel⬛latte☕, where the central idea is agent and displacement. In BCS, there are agents—the small moving circles—that get their colors ripped away by the surrounding pixels. Though they occur on the same screen space, they are separated in their own cells, a simultaneous multiverse of sorts. In some iterations, a very clear voronoi pattern will appear. I didn't consciously strive for this look. It's what naturally happens, when you try to divide space, so that the borders occur exactly in between the closest neighbor. When I first saw this pattern emerge, I wanted to see how far I could get the distinct cells to influence each other. The idea that the same algorithmic processes can happen many times but still separately in a single piece has always interested me (and explored in the Infinite Browse series). BCS is an extension of that, albeit a little more chaotic.\n\nNote:\n- Best experience on browsers and devices with support for WebGL2 \n\nMade by Sam Tsao (@sam___tsao) with P5, P5Fbo and perlinjs.\n",

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

            "description": "For my first drop on the new fxhash v1.0 I wanted to make something different. So I challenged myself to write a raymarcher like the ones I use in my shaders but in p5.js and make a fully procedural scene with it. It's a bit tricky to work with vectors once you are used to GLSL, but I managed to write a decent algorithm that scans a grid and slowly draws the image. It draws it with circles and triangles for the grass. The first thing I used for testing was a SDF of a plane with some tall bars on it. Then I was trying different distortions on the shapes and in one moment the results gave me the idea of a scene with mushrooms and grass on an undulated terrain. Later I added a small river and a cloudy sky. I think I was inadvertently inspired by some children's books I had when I was a kid. \n\nBest viewed full screen.\n\nFeatures:\n\nMood: happy - normal - melancholic - strange - sleepy\nMushrooms: 2 - 4 (sometimes one of the mushrooms can only be seen on full screen)\nMushroom height: short - medium - tall\nMushroom fatness: S - M - L - XL\nMushroom shape: 1 - 2 - 3- 4 - 5\nMushroom tilt\nFlowers color: white - yellow - pink - cyan - multicolor\nRiver: yes - no\nCamera orientation: north - south",

            "description": "This token was created for THE PASSAGE: Pitch Drop experience, an interactive minting experience where your choices determine the design of your token. \n\nTo take part, please purchase an Edition 5 Coin on fx(hash) by HERE & NOW. The artwork and experience draw inspiration from the 'The Pitch Drop Experiment': the world's longest-running laboratory experiment. Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\n____\n\n\nWhile we wait for the 10th drop of pitch to fall in the famous Pitch Drop experiment, I couldn’t avoid thinking about time and change, capturing and preserving a moment of time, the history of art and science, and how we participate in the manipulation of the time itself.  \n\nThe history of new media art is deeply linked to technical developments in photography and its creative applications. With still and moving images, artists were introduced to a new way of visualizing time. Through the use of time lapses, long exposures, slowing down, and fast forwarding, time was manipulated, captured, rearranged, and modified in numerous ways.\n  \nThe French philosopher Henri Bergson believed that reality was in flux and that \"the essence of time is that it goes by.\" His thoughts about time and metaphysics had a significant impact on artists working in all media at the turn of the 20th century. Although he believed in pure perception unaided by machines, and looked down on the introduction of technology into the arts, for artists, who had always been fascinated with the body in space and time, he became their muse. Even before the widespread adoption of technological advances in artistic practices, painters were incorporating aspects of \"movement of time\" into their works (e.g., futurists, Giacomo Balla, but also Marcel Duchamp ). \n\nAnother influential figure for artists was Eadweard Muybridge. In 1878 he photographed a racehorse at full speed, becoming the first to capture what looked like the actual, discrete sequence of motion. After devising the system of several cameras (12 for the first sequence he made), set in a row and arranged to go off in a sequence (with shutters released by pulled strings), he became fascinated with “secrets of time, secrets locked inside basic human movements – a leap, a splash, a walk […]”*. \n\nAll of this inspired me to create and capture algorithmically generated shapes, and record their subtle changes through time and space in the style of vintage scientific illustrations, film strips, long-exposure photos, and comic book panels. Each frame inside this view is one fraction of a second later than the previous one, and the whole frame view is slightly shifted. Your actions inside of the Passage will influence everything, from the number of rows and columns inside of the grid to the color palettes, shapes, and sizes of the objects.\n\n_____\n* Jad Abumrad (host) & Rebecca Solnet (author) say this when they talk about Muybridge in the episode Time, on the Radiolab podcast, aired Aug 24, 2010 (https://radiolab.org/episodes/91584-time)\n",

            "description": "Title: \"Punctuated Equilibrium\"\n\nBespoke artwork that also acts as a token for a yearly subscription to The Tickle - 12 monthly issues of the pre-eminent magazine for contemporary digital art and creative writing (@inwarhol@twitter.com). This special artwork for the February issue is created by Andrew Brereton (@aebrer@genart.social), entitled \"Punctuated Equilibrium\". Each monthly issue is airdropped on the first Friday of each month to holders of the token. Primary collection activates the subscription - secondary collectors simply adopt the existing subscription, receiving all remaining issues. \n\nHolders also become members of The Tickle Subscribers Club, gaining access to exclusive airdrops of free art from our featured artists!\n\n-- \n\nPunctuated Equilibrium is a piece about Entropy Locking and searching infinite spaces. Roughly every 10 seconds, the current equilibrium is checked, and if it doesn't meet the right conditions, the random seed is incremented. Each search leaves its own trace behind, getting sucked into the final equilibrium which is reached (if a valid solution is discovered). This can happen right away, or it can take infinite time.\n\nThe seed is akin to the \"conditions\" of the world these pixels live in (due to the restrictions imposed by the entropy locking). Just like if our universe had different conditions, different life may have arisen; in this piece each seed provides unique conditions for the (brutally simple) automata rules that push the pixels around. This seed is what is changed when a solution fails.\n\nLike I have done previously in \"RGB Summoning Cycles\", I am using a buffer to inspect the progress of the piece for a given seed. Unlike in RGB Summoning Cycles, this search is strictly destined to succeed: it will always find an equilibrium which modifies all of the displayed pixels in a consistent pattern. However, over time the consequences of the failed searches leave their trace, resulting in the full complexity of the final piece, which is designed to cycle and iterate infinitely within the stable equilibrium it eventually discovers.\n\nIn nature, solutions are not pre-computed: they are evolved out of an insanely complex mess. Often, this plays out via a phenomenon known as \"Punctuated Equilibrium\", or \"Punctuated Evolution\". Long periods of stability cycle regularly with brief periods of massive change. I think we see this pattern simply because it's a reliable way to shake up entrenched, complex, and random systems; after all, we only see the things that succeeded and the equilibria that survived to the present day. Everything else merely remains as traces buried in the noise.\n",

It is also inspired by old dot-matrix printers that create a pattern of dots when printing. To see the artwork in detail, open it in high quality and zoom in. Various densities and more than 12 color palettes have been used.\n\n-----------\n\n- Add &density=2 to 12 to the live view URL to render the image at higher resolution.\n\n- Press ’s’ on the live mode to save the artwork.\n\n  Made with p5js.",

            "description": "This project is borne out of my longstanding fascination with brushwork, and the intricate textures that can be created with a brush, some paint and a canvas. Brush strokes are simulated using many overlapping lines and given texture and depth using a custom shader. Another important aspect of this work, is the composite forms that are created by the brush strokes, which are my attempt to emulate the emphatic energy of many abstract painters that have come before me. Color palettes are named after common paint colors, based on the background color used for the palette.\n\nThose who collect during the first tier of the Dutch Auction can claim a signed print. They will be printed on A3 Hahnemuhle Photo Rag, and shipped to the collector free of charge. More details on how to claim a print and specify the necessary shipping information will be provided via the artists twitter (@landlinesart1).\n\nIn live mode, add &size=<YOUR_PIXEL_SIZE> to change the pixel size of the image for export (Right click to save). For example, &size=4000 will set the width of the image to be 4000 pixels.",

            "description": "This work is the result of a deterministic algorithm which manifests differently depending on the device it is viewed upon.  \n\nThe basis for the project is a phenomenon called z-fighting, a common issue in 3d graphics that appears when two or more objects overlap in 3d space. The graphic drivers on a device cannot determine which  object is closer or farther from the viewpoint since they were in exactly the same place. If we consider reality to be a continuum including our physical and digital experiences, z-fighting is a strictly digital phenomenon as objects trying to occupy the same physical space usually have tragic or intimate consequences.\n\nThe work in the current generative art movement is based on deterministic algorithms. This means that given a set of input parameters, the result should be exactly the same. This ideal is hardly ever the case as the code behind the art goes through different processing steps, on different CPUs, rendered on different GPUs, and interpreted by different graphics drivers. The code in this project is deterministic, it includes no conditions to adapt one way or the other to any particular hardware device, yet due to how the varying hardware and software devices try to mitigate z-fighting, this same code generates an entirely different experience on different devices.\n\nTo further exploit the nuances of these consequences, this work generates an audio score based on the generated graphics, analysing the canvas with a clustering algorithm and converting color values to notes, volume, and distortion.\n\nA back-end system has been developed to render out each iteration across a variety of devices.
