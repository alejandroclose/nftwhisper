            "description": "A plane is repeatedly folded over itself, choosing creases either at random, or according to some pattern (like a grid). These creases form the boundaries of the individual textured tiles.\n\nOnce the folds are complete, they are undone in reverse order, recreating the original plane. With each unfolding, the orientation of each crease (as a mountain or a valley), and each tile (facing up or down) is recorded as a sequence of 1s and 0s. Tiles are colored and textured according to similarities in these binary sequences, giving rise to subtle symmetries and repetitions.\n\nWritten in vanilla JS & HTML5 Canvas.\n\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "This piece is a reflection of my passions, a blend of the visual and the auditory, and a testament to the power of interdisciplinary inspiration.\n\nAt the very core of 'Cable Management' lies the mesmerizing aura of 'Impressions of Order' by nbswwit. This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.\n\nMy deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.\n\nAn algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.\n\nNavigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. \n\nAnd lastly, a heartfelt dedication. Through every line of code, every algorithm tweak, she remained my rock. Alice, as you embrace another year, this piece is not just an ode to my creative journey but also a heartfelt tribute to you, my biggest supporter since the outset. This project, and every beat of my heart, is for you. <3\n\n3500x4953px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

            "description": "This piece is a reflection of my passions, a blend of the visual and the auditory, and a testament to the power of interdisciplinary inspiration.\n\nAt the very core of 'Cable Management' lies the mesmerizing aura of 'Impressions of Order' by nbswwit. This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.\n\nMy deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.\n\nAn algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.\n\nNavigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. \n\nAnd lastly, a heartfelt dedication. Through every line of code, every algorithm tweak, she remained my rock. Alice, as you embrace another year, this piece is not just an ode to my creative journey but also a heartfelt tribute to you, my biggest supporter since the outset. This project, and every beat of my heart, is for you. <3\n\n3500x4953px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

These are details that weren't hard-coded but emerge organically, such as the patterns on the spines of the dunes or the stripes around their bases.\n\nPlease note that the algorithm can take some time to run, especially when the number of dunes is high.\n\nCreated by lunarean.",

Using distinct minimalist components, the algorithm patterns, contorts, and intertwines geometries to reveal rich and vital maximalist compositions. The explorations of Risonanza revels in the quirks that emerge through this process, seemingly with spontaneity. They invite us to identify and savor the underlying simplicity of a common language that resides amidst all manners of imperfections, randomness, and intricate complexities we perceive around us.\n\nEmbodying the equilibrium between simplicity and intricacy, these works represent the dance between the innate harmony of existence and life's unknown paths. This balance of forces provides a simple and joyful invitation to attune to the energetic, complex, and singular harmonious essence of each work of art – an embodiment of the eternal resonance that courses through the universe.\n\n\n—————\n\nTENDER x whitekross\nSeptember 2023\n\nRisonanza is Italian for Resonance, and is a generative art series created by Alessandro Fiore (AKA whitekross) in collaboration with Adam Berninger of Tender.\n\n—————\n\n\nKey commands:\n\n1 = 2000x3000\n2 = 4000x6000\n3 = 6000x9000 (Dependent on your browser limitations, tested on Safari (Mac))\ns = Save at current resolution\n\n\nLicense:\n\nSee LICENSE.md in live view for details.",

            "description": "This piece is a reflection of my passions, a blend of the visual and the auditory, and a testament to the power of interdisciplinary inspiration.\n\nAt the very core of 'Cable Management' lies the mesmerizing aura of 'Impressions of Order' by nbswwit. This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.\n\nMy deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.\n\nAn algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.\n\nNavigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. \n\nAnd lastly, a heartfelt dedication. Through every line of code, every algorithm tweak, she remained my rock. Alice, as you embrace another year, this piece is not just an ode to my creative journey but also a heartfelt tribute to you, my biggest supporter since the outset. This project, and every beat of my heart, is for you. <3\n\n3500x4953px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.\n\nMy deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.\n\nAn algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.\n\nNavigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. \n\nAnd lastly, a heartfelt dedication. Through every line of code, every algorithm tweak, she remained my rock. Alice, as you embrace another year, this piece is not just an ode to my creative journey but also a heartfelt tribute to you, my biggest supporter since the outset. This project, and every beat of my heart, is for you. <3\n\n3500x4953px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",
