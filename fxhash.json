            "description": "Mudaashiku (「無駄足区」- “Fool’s Errand District”) invokes the place where you first really experienced what it means to be a person in a city. Were you awestruck? Did you feel lost or disoriented by a realization of the size of the spaces around you? Perhaps you sought some detail, some small thing to focus on to reorient yourself and feel like a person again in the face of such immensity and confusion.\n\nThis work is inspired by an attempt to capture some of the feeling I had when I first moved to Tokyo and was utterly overwhelmed. It was both exciting and frightening to suddenly be lost in a place so immense and unfamiliar. If Stendhal Syndrome refers to the fearful ecstasy of experiencing the beauties of Florence, then there must be something similar for the first experience of a great city. This work attempts only to point in the direction of such a feeling.\n\nTake a moment to experience the district as a whole, but then, with a change of perception, your focus may shift to the individual building or group of buildings. And then, back again. This duality of scales has been integral to the development of the work.\n\nThe work expresses eight features:\nAspect ratio: 1:1.2, 1:1.41, 1.41:1, 1.2:1\nEnvironment: Central (most common), north river, east river, south causeway, west causeway (most rare).\nPalette: Thirty seven selected palettes. Chosen either for their aesthetic qualities, or as an attempted expression of some element of urban life.\nDivisions: 15, 18, or 21.\nColor variance: 0.03, 0.06, 0.09, 0.12, 0.18, 0.27, 0.36, 0.54.\nSun direction: East or west.\nLocale: Either central or commuter town. Determines the height profile of the district.\nRoads: Represented, or not.\n\nThe work begins by gradually revealing the layout of the district. This process can take from about 6 seconds to as much as 2 minutes, but 50 to 60 seconds is typical. When this process is complete, the colors and facades will be added and the work revealed.\n\nOnce the work is complete, it can be adjusted using the following controls:\n\n[0] Fit size to window (default)\n[1] Set shortest edge to 1000 pixels\n[2] Set shortest edge to 2000 pixels\n[3] Set shortest edge to 4000 pixels\n[4] Set shortest edge to 8000 pixels (please be patient!)\n\nAfter changing the dimensions, the work may appear the same size in your browser. The new dimensions will be apparent when you save an image.\n\n[s] Save work at current dimensions\n[b] Add or remove border\n[g] Add or remove background grain\n\nMade in 100% vanilla javascript.\nOpenSimplexNoise.js used for noise.\n",

            "description": "Power Ranges is an artistic endeavor born not from a concept, but from the pure spirit of experimentation. While I could attempt to uncover a profound narrative or significance behind this project, the truth of the matter is that Power Ranges is, in essence, just a form of digital doodling with code. A testament to the beauty of unbridled exploration in the realm of art, where discovery and wonder sometimes take precedence over any predetermined purpose.\n\nIn this project, I have harnessed the power of height maps and ranges to create an intriguing visual experience. The origin was the implementation of the marching squares algorithm that I had never used before. From there I started to play with height maps, mixing noise and custom shapes. Finally, I wrote a parser for the map in order to generate the isolines that are then drawn using my beloved Superline script.\n\nI hope you’ll like the outputs as much as I did while testing the algorithm. Some of them can be truly cute.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ”s” to save the current output.\n\nPressing the keys “1”, “2” or “3” the artwork will regenerate at a different scale.\n\nThe “size” parameter can also be passed via URL with the values “s”, “m” or “l” to initialize the generator with the desired size.\n\n=======================================\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\nPowered by p5 and chroma.\n",

            "description": "Step into the vibrant world of FXHash 2, where art meets innovation! This piece of art is a tribute to the launch, inviting you to immerse yourself in its dynamic visuals.\n\nOnce upon a time, in the realm of the lines, there rested a world overlooked by the atmospheric views of hills, christened as Harmonious Hill. A world, where the sun, the moon, and the stars were born out of infinite circles effortlessly looping. A world that was bathed utterly in monochrome hues of the cosmic palette.\n\nIt was once teeming with life, laughter, and colors before the great apocalypse. A disaster so colossal, that it wiped out all color, replacing it with an eternal melancholy of black and white.\n\nThe Harmonious Hill, though stripped of its vibrancy, stood resiliently against time. The skies were filled with perpetual fog, a reminder of the long-lost days. The vertical and curvy hills, once gliding into vibrant valleys, now housed derelict and deserted towns.\n\nThe Taiga trees, bound by the monochrome, delineated themselves as large silhouettes against the never-ending horizontal line of the sky, whispering tales of the catastrophic past to the lonely artists. The haunting echoes of the past continued to reverberate, ironically absorbed by these mute trees.\n\nAmid the somber monotones, the lone survivors were the birds. Soaring across the gloomy apartment buildings, their elegiac songs spun tales of lost epochs in the cold air, threading through the silent trees and melancholy fog.\n\nOne day, a new phenomenon graced the hills. The everyday circle loop of the sun enlarged, as though trying to consume the sullen world. Fear encapsulated the folks of the Harmonious Hill as they watched the sun spiral, assuming it to be the second apocalypse in line.\n\nIn the foreboding silence, a tiny speck of white emerged from the enormous sun, descending to the sky. As it journeyed closer, the birds serenaded its descent. It was a seed, glowing white and vibrant against the black skies.\n\nUpon reaching the cold ground, it burrowed into the heart of Harmonious Hill. Silence fell once more; the sun receded to its normal loop. Days turned into nights, and nights into days.\n\nThen, in the stillness of a frosty dawn, the seed burst forth from the ice-cold soil. A majestic tree, unlike any Taiga trees, flourished. It sprouted not just leaves, but colors. Colors of hope, resilience, and rejuvenation. It shone vibrantly, piercing through the eternal fog.\n\nThe birds sang, and their melodies turned from dirges to ditties of joy. The people in the houses awoken from their centuries-old slumber, stepping out for the first time into the fresh, thawing world. As they saw the growing tree of colors, they weaved stories of a new beginning, a world reborn.\n\nIn the realm of lines and monochromes, the world of Harmonious Hill thus welcomed hope, banishing its perpetual sadness into a tale of survival and rebirth. The apocalypse became a fable of transcendence, of how desolate lives could burgeon anew, in the miraculous world of art.\n\nTo navigate and interact with the artwork, here are the key controls:\n\nS Key: Press 'S' to save the image content of the current frame.

            "description": "\"the Pazyryk\"\n\"In the years 1326 to 1328 of the Solar Hijri calendar (equivalent to 1947–1949 AD), during a time when the Pazyryk carpet, the world's oldest known carpet, was discovered by Sergei Rudenko, a Russian archaeologist, in the Pazyryk Valley. This woolen carpet, adorned with vibrant colors, depicts images of horse riders, grazing deer, and mythical creatures.\n\nIn 'the Pazyryk' collection, inspired by the Pazyryk carpet and the exquisite artistry of carpets and kilims from the eastern regions, an exceptional display of the essence of color in abstract art has emerged. This collection has transformed into a comprehensive exhibition of timeless historical and artistic endeavors, offering viewers an innovative and profound experience through a wide spectrum of colors and artistic creativity.\n\nThe Pazyryk collection has been meticulously designed using 153 different color palettes and three distinct sizes with high resolution suitable for printing. This collection aims to present the colors, essence, and art of the eastern regions to the audience. Each color palette acts as a testimony to the amalgamation of emotions and insights of prominent artists throughout art history. Every color palette has been meticulously derived from the works of these famous artists, representing a fusion of interpretation and personal perspective. These palettes convey an abstract representation of artistic and technological trends, where color and coding techniques blend harmoniously.\n\nBy merging historical art with contemporary innovations, The Pazyryk reflects a living connection between the history of art and contemporary artistic currents. In this piece, I have endeavored to provide the audience with an abstract bridge for a deeper understanding of new art and creativity. Just as sunlight rapidly and captivatingly reflects off stained glass windows of eastern palaces, spreading a unique tapestry of light and shadow on the walls and floors, The Pazyryk conveys a distinctive experience of art and history through the rare abstraction of color and light. Each color palette simultaneously encapsulates a visualization of history and contemporary reflections, inviting us to a mesmerizing celebration of colors and forms.\n\n-\"To propagate the essence of My wonderful community, 50% of the royalty from each secondary sale will be attributed to minters.\"\n\nNOTE: \"This code follows a complex algorithm for its creation, so you may need to wait a bit for each result to load.

The algorithm, inspired by the playfulness of childhood, creates whimsical, childish paintings reminiscent of a time when computers were new and learning happened through wild exploration.\n\nDesigned to mimic the uninhibited creativity of a child at play, the algorithm produces artworks with pixelated charm, vibrant colors, and blocky shapes.This generative art project becomes a nostalgic time capsule, rekindling the joy of learning through play in the digital landscape of childhood.\n\nPress 4 or 8 to export in 4k and 8k in PNG.\nPress 's' to to export in screen resolution.\n\nMurat Atimtay 2024 | @atimtay | https://www.atimtay.xyz",

            "description": "Machine Spirit picks up where Equilibrium and Equanimity left off. Notwithstanding my love for generative mountains, trees, and (especially) cities, my personal artistic quest remains to produce an algorithm that generates convincing abstract art in the style of Richter and Rothko. The project you are looking at is my best attempt yet.\n\nTrigger warning: some iterations produce rapidly flashing colors which may pose a risk of seizure to people with photosensitive epilepsy or similar conditions.\n\nWhile the final result is a static image, the live view visualizes how the image is generated. It goes something like this: you start with a grid of cells in random colors, and you feed that into a carefully customized cellular automaton, where the color of each cell is determined by the color of that cell and its neighbours in the previous generation. If you end up with a single color over-powering all the others, or too many different fragmented colors, you start over. But when you reach a stable state with two or three colors, you have achieved your goal: a mathematical balance in color and composition that tends to be aesthetically pleasing as well. You then select a suitable canvas color and run a more computationally intensive rendering process, which makes the end result look more like physical paint on canvas, while retaining the subtle traces of its digital origins.\n\nPress [b]leed, [c]anvas or [d]ensity in the live view to cycle through variations, or [p]rint to save a high resolution capture.\n\nAll iterations eventually converge to a stable state, but in theory this could last arbitrarily long, and on rare occasions it may take longer than 5 minutes, in which case the captured preview will be different from the final result. This artwork is fully generative and was hand-coded in 7,500 characters of plain JavaScript code. I didn't use any libraries, but I did take inspiration from an essay by Tyler Hobbs on polygon deformation techniques.\n\nForever limited to 250 editions on the Tezos blockchain. I truly hope you will enjoy yours. London, March 2022.",
