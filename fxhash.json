Looking especially deep into dynamic grids and dynamic frame rates.\n\nAs for the piece itself, it's a reference to how busy this modern world is. How we're all constantly on the go, whether that is physically, or mentally. Almost feeling like a monsoon. A storm of information. A storm of life. A storm of work. A storm of thoughts. A storm of emotions. A storm of everything. And it's all so fast.\n\nAs are the particles. They're all moving around these cyclones of information. Glowing up like neon signs in a busy city. Moving so fast it's almost a blur. Forming into something greater than the sum of its parts.\n",

What does it mean to be stuck in one day? When everything around you is changing, living, breathing, dying, only you alone, like a stone statue. Nothing can touch you, and your feelings are externally muted to a minimum. Calm, joy, fear, anxiety, despair. You don't seem to have lost the ability to live, but you are somehow helpless and immobile. All your thoughts and experiences flow through your empty body, driving you insane. Everything around you distorts and changes in your eyes. And all you can do is remind yourself that it's just one long day. And I hope your tomorrow comes very soon. ",

How we're all constantly on the go, whether that is physically, or mentally. Almost feeling like a monsoon. A storm of information. A storm of life. A storm of work. A storm of thoughts. A storm of emotions. A storm of everything. And it's all so fast.\n\nAs are the particles. They're all moving around these cyclones of information. Glowing up like neon signs in a busy city.

            "description": "\"The images is not a closed field of knowledge; it is a whirling, centrifugal field. It is not a fiedl of knowledge like any other; it is a movement demanding all the anthropogical aspects of being and time\" Didi-Huberman\n\nContinuing in the experimentation of photography and generative art.\n\nWhat's left of what's left ... Seeks to take the reflection beyond the simple superimposition of images, highlighting the \"human\" x \"machine\" interaction.\n\nThe areas of light, fog and shadows present us with image clippings in a large tangle of visual reflections.\n\nThe algorithm builds unique images from the combination of different layers, according to a bank of photographs extracted from my own collection. In total, there are six layers containing 10 photographs each, in addition to a base layer containing 20 photos of urban fragments.\n\nIn addition, the code implements, in a random and semi-autonomous way, some adaptations such as masking, colorization, rotation and blending modes for specific layers.\n\n* Features\nPlace - Where have i been. 20 distinct urban fragments;\nMode - “Color” 80% or “B&W” 20%;\nZone - “Amazon” 25%; “Mist” and “Terracotta” 20%, “Old Sky” 15%; and “Ocher” and “Golden” 10%.\nInvert - 2.5%\n\n\"In a sense of overlapping past/future, not as an idea of ​​current time, but as places of memory dispute. This \"non-place\", traversed by layers, is solidified in the images, almost like a truce from the endless war of this inconstancy.\nthere is no winner\" Raffa Gomes\n\nGenerative Token by of Morbeck for fxhash\n\naugust 21, 2022",

            "description": "The xDeads are 11x11 pixel art collectible characters, generated algorithmically on-chain with proof of ownership stored on the Tezos blockchain. It’s one of the first collections of generative PFP’s based on Hydra, and implemented using p5 and createloop libraries.\n\nThere are a few functions for interacting with art: Press 'p' to download screen 1500x1500 (live mode) Press 'x' to download a 5 second gif (Live Mod) Click on screen to play/pause music and make art interact. ( it can take time )\n\nWhat are those xDeads, afterall?\n\nEverything starts when a company named xCorp, a bulwark on technology on the planet, began their evil plan in the name of profit: control human minds in order to alienate the population in whatever the corporation wants and needs. This alienation power was only possible by the possession of a rare, mysterious and mistic objkt: a pickle, that contains an absurd energy power that no one knows its origin.\n\nIn the past, the xCorporation concentrate its power and resources on I.A. and robot engineering - and this was their first mistake. The second one was to focus only on the alienation project, leaving all the robots on their own, who started to settle their own plan: to conquer the sacred objkt, the pickle, and use it to their own interests.\n\nEventually, the robots reach the supremacy of the world, leaving all the human kind, now dumb and disaffected, wandering like zombies. 100 years in this mess have passed when a mighty eclipses emerges on the sky, heralding the arrival of hungry aliens, atracted by the power of the pickle.\n\nIn fact, it was the aliens, back when the human race did not exist in the planet, who plant the seed of the pickle, hoping to get back when the objkt reach its final form. It was the pickle power in the earth who give the humans consciousness, and only this objkt can make them go back to their normal state.\n\nThe whole earth is now a battlefield: aliens, robots and zombies struggling to have the possession of the artifact in order to keep their survival.\n\nxDeads Features: The xDeads world is subdivided in three Classes: Robots, Zombies, Aliens. All of them include the Emission gas: Tezonium, Carbon and Lead. The classes are, as well, overwelmed by alignment: Lawful Neutral, True Neutral, Chaotic Neutral. Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good. Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, Chaotic Evil. The xDeads have Background features too: Gray, White, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Black. And the last feature is an important one, the Ki, wich represents the power of each xDead(in rarity order): in Robots, in Zombies, in the Aliens\n\nIf you have luck, your xDead’s Ki will be over 9000!\n\n..and one more thing\n\nAll the xDeads come with a modular music and a reaction system that moves with the frequencies of the amplifier embedded to the NFT: a music that tells part of the history, and how your xDead connect with the chaotic world it had born. All of the tracks were composed by dead_marcelo on Vcvrack, a eurorack synthesizer.\n\nThe perception of the pixel in xDeads philosophy\n\nAs Professor Herbert W. Frank once said, it is well known nowadays that the brain and the sensory organs function on a physical basis and that perception itself is above all a kind of data processing. We are all the time learning and regurgitating the information we received. But the thing doesn’t stop right there. The human brain have multiples steps in processing information, variating since memories till fully conscious analysis.\n\nIn the pixels world – more specifically in the xDeads world – the perception of the nature of each creature is no different. What is a pixel if not a squared extension of what we see everyday? When you see pixels on a screen you are looking at molecules or atoms that are emitting or transmitting light. Light itself does not consist of molecules.\n\nWe use this type of abstraction to tell xDeads history and, perhaps, predict the future.",

            "description": "\"Nature is the source of all true knowledge\".\n\nHave you ever taken the time to look, deeply look, at all the details in a humble patch of grass ?\n\nIn this tiny microcosm, a constant, fierce battle is going on, day after day, plants reaching out for sun, down for access to soil, fighting for survival. Smaller grasses form groups, alliances making it harder for taller ones to take over. Dead leaves remind us that some of them lost the fight, fallen warriors who, soon enough, will be forgotten too. Growth, decay, life, death, the endless cycle, right in front of our eyes.\n\nIt is fascinating, and, for me at least, an endless source of inspiration.\n\nIt is my hope that, through this project, you will take the time to take a closer look at nature, and that, as the pale blue dot we call home keeps getting drier and drier, remember that even humble patches of grass should not be taken for granted.\n\n\nKey commands:\n's' - save as png\n'b' - make the background transparent (for printing)\n'1', '2, '4' - set the pixel density, for resolutions up to 8000x8000\n\nThis updated version of the project should render on mobile devices, albeit with slightly reduced quality. \nIf you want to save the image for printing, I recommend you do so on desktop.\n",
