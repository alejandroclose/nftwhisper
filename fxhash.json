            "description": "'Here When You Need Me' is a generative system that creates...\n\nGood question, and I think the answer is up to you. Jewels? Reflections? The Sand in a Life's Hourglass?\n\nWho knows. The truth is that I didn't have anything in mind for the project, and where it has ended up was purely through exploration, and a refinement of simple methods.\n\nBy the end, it has become exactly what I needed it to be, and the results of this project give me an encouragement that is difficult to explain.\n\nNow, one of the primary features of the project is your ability to make it what you need. Several URL arguments are explained below that will allow you to tweak your edition's distortion and resolution.\n\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Girls Who Code'\n15% of primary sales will be donated to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n\n10% of royalties will go to 'Girls Who Code'\n10% of royalties will go to 'Cure Parkinson's'\n10% of royalties will go to the original minter\n\nThank you everyone.\n\n\nOptions\n-------\nParameters can be appended to the live URL to adjust the output's distortion, resolution, border size, and border color. These are all fun to play with, and can be used in combination to showcase the variability and potential of each piece.\n\n'&distortion=#': Adjust distortion, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 to see a 'flat' version of the image)\n'&resolution=#': Multiplier for width/height, any value from 0.1 to 6.0 (Soft max of 3.9)\n'&borderSize=#': Multiplier for border size, any value from 0.0 to 3.0 (Use 0 for no border)\n'&borderColor=ffffff': Custom border color, any 6 character hex code (Do not include '#')\n\nAn example of using multiple options would be '&resolution=2&distortion=.5'\n\nPlease check the linked fx(text) article for detailed examples on using these options.\n\n\nDistortion\n----------\nI wanted to provide some amount of control to take advantage of the possibilities of generative art. 'Here When You Need Me' starts off at a certain point, but allows you to adjust the distortion to your favorite level.\n\nUsing '&distortion=0' will show the underlying shapes.\n\n\nResolution / Printing\n---------------------\n'Here When You Need Me' looks best with at least '&resolution=2' and is designed to support printing. Remember that parameters can be provided to adjust the border attributes as well.\n\nIdeally, you should aim for 300 'pixels per inch' for a decent quality print. Default resolution is 1800x2400.\n\n'&resolution=1' -> 6\"x8\"\n'&resolution=2' -> 12\"x16\"\n\nSome quick math will give you the correct modifier if you start with the width in inches of your desired print. \n\n(inches) * (ppi) / (default width)\n\nAn important note, the maximum resolution modifier I've had success with is 3.9 because of the browser's image size limitations, but the capability is still in the code to go higher in case it is helpful to someone.\n\nIf you have your edition printed, please share with me because it would make me incredibly happy to see it!\n\n\n---------\nThank you to everyone for your support and contributions. \n\nI put way more detail in this description than I intended, but if you want even more, you can read about the development and potential of this project in the accompanying fx(text) article, once it is written.\n\nCreated by Walter Anderson (@noxiarb)",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "Our realities appear as a layering of moments, emotions, and choices that accumulate through space and time. These experiences pile up to form the foundation for everything to come, shaping our perspectives and influencing our sense of self, character, and worldview.\n\n'Pile' embraces the infinite possibilities of generative art to represent the rich, complex, and cumulative nature of life's experiences through the passage of time. Each moment builds on top of previous memories, where the present is always the sharpest, yet is soon obscured by what follows. Just as the imprint of past experiences can linger in our lives, the influences of older layers can still be seen in each piece, imbuing each composition with a depth and variety that is indicative of life's many histories. Composed of these textured and stacked layers, ‘Pile’ forms a dense and organic heap that embodies the controlled chaos of life's multitudes.\n\nResponses to our experiences tend to oscillate between thoughtfully pragmatic and mechanical means – and more sensitive, organic, and even passionate approaches. They’re a blur of exactitude and wildness, entropy and growth, a range of experiences and outcomes that vary so greatly that only by changing our perspectives and taking a step back can we see the commonality between each of our piles of life’s moments. The result is a visual representation of the cumulative nature of life's experiences, where forgotten moments and cherished memories are piled high with abandon, yet worthy of celebration.\n\nInspired by the works of artists such as Jackson Pollock and Joan Mitchell, 'Pile' invites us to contemplate the rich and multifaceted nature of life, and to celebrate the distinctive stories that each of us carries within. Through its vivid abstraction of life's controlled chaos, and the tension between organic lines and overtly digital marks, 'pile' beckons us to consider the intricacies of our own layered identities and to revel in the diversity of life.\n\ncreated in p5.js.\n\n_________________________\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press ‘p’ to save png\n- Press ‘1’ - ‘9’ to run a high resolution file (higher resolution files will take longer to load)\n",
