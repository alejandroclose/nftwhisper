            "description": "Mei(梅):\n\n\"Mei\" is an oriental art piece featuring the imagery of plum blossom, a symbol of courage and perseverance in traditional Chinese culture.\n\nThe generative system at the backend of \"Mei\" is an exploration of this cultural symbol by modern art language. The basic elements of the paintings are merely circles and enclosed flow field shapes. A great variety of short and light strokes of such elements are used across the paintings. Xuan paper is occasionally used as background, which is a painting material since the Tang dynasty.\n\nMei's outputs span different stages of plum blossom from winter to spring. The scene also changes from a calm day to snowy or even stormy weather. The consistent yet complex senses and feelings reflected are surprisingly versatile.",

The Game of Life is a zero-player game, its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.\n\nMaps of Life is a generative-player game, an algorithm that creates an initial random configuration and a collector that observes how the configuration evolves. Each mint produces a distinctly unique cartographic representation of an ideal town, with different color palettes, scales, and coordinates, an animation from its random birth to a stopped moment in time.\n\nMaps of Life assumes that the built environment has a life of its own. And besides, only an automatic mind can name towns with Butterfly Names. Enjoy the view.\n\n---\nInteractivity:\nPress LEFT and RIGHT arrows to speed-up or slow-down the evolution of the town.\nPress \"S\" to save the current state to a PNG image.\nIf you want to change the resolution, just add \"?res=XXX\" to the end of the url.\n---\n\n(With these keys, you can possibly force the script to continue until its further completion.

            "description": "The Enfantines are three sets of beginner piano pieces by Erik Satie, written with the aim of preparing children for the sound patterns of modern music. Composed in 1913, these are genuine children’s pieces, crafted for small hands, easy to learn. \n\n“Enfantines I. Small Talk” is the first of a set of algorithms that explore the basics of Generative Art, written with the aim of preparing artists for the script patterns of digital life. “Small Talk” experiments with grids, flow-fields, and brushes; all with a fresh, almost childish style.\n\n“Give them almost a \"naive\" feeling (not to take it the wrong way though) similar to kids drawings which can seem simple and dispensable, careless, but you will always have a parent who wants to frame it and put it on the wall.” @LukaPiskorec\n\nWith two modes that won’t produce the same outputs, “Enfantines I. Small Talk” is best experienced twice. In music mode, the code uses Satie’s piano composition as a way of taming randomness, the sounds affecting the parameters of the strokes.\n\nHey, they have won me congratulations from the Shah of Persia and the King of Yvetot!\n\n\n\n#### STORY ####\n\n// Friday, 30 September 2022 - 18:00\n\nI’ve been teaching P5JS to draw like a child. I thought it was a good idea to start from the basics. It is barely able to use the crayons, the coloured pencils and the markers, very rough and shaky. It cannot follow simple commands. I’m done for today, very infuriating.\n\n// Wednesday, 5 October 2022 - 11:00\n\nThe robot can produce straight lines now. It is able to change colours without getting stuck. I haven’t been sleeping well, my desk is full of books on The Psychology Of Children's Artwork, it’s crazy to think that artists and philosophers were much into kid’s drawings in the 30s-50s. Herbert Read was sure that one could understand a kid’s mind by looking at drawings. I think P5JS is trying to tell me something, but it’s only capable of very basic movements. I’m trying to add complexity to the training as fast as possible.\n\n// Tuesday, 11 October 2022 - 16:40\n\nI feel close to a turnaround. The robot random strokes definitely feel like patterns. I cannot waste any time, I need to finish the algo and let it free. I’m sure that I can approach the AI’s conscience via its childish drawings.\n\n// Wednesday, 12 October 2022 - 10:30\n\nI was wrong. There are no patterns, P5JS is dead, the strokes feel dead. Something must be broken. I need to review my code, maybe I’ll need to start from scratch, maybe I’m crazy and this is not possible.\n\n// Saturday, 15 October 2022 - 04:55\n\nA few hours ago, I passed away in front of my computer. I had not been able to find the bugs, gave up, put some classical music. Just woke up in the middle of the night, \n¡The ALGO is alive!\nThe strokes are alive, so strong, so lively. I think it was the music. If I pause the music, the brushes lose their life. I’ve run some tests, looks like it works best with classical compositions. The logs show that it first woke up with “Menus propos enfantins” by Erik Satie. It is alive. I need to tell everyone.\n\n####\n\n\n# INTERACTIVITY\n\n// Modes:\n- Double Click/Tap or Press M for AUDIO mode\n- Wait for SILENT mode\n- Add “?res=171” to the URL for FULL SCREEN MODE (pseudo-deterministic).\n\n// More\n- Press I for Trait Info (desktop)\n- Press 1 to download a .png (double tap on mobile)\n- Add “?res=XXX” to the URL for HQ renders (XXX = width of the canvas).\n\n# EASY-TO-READ CODE\nThe “Enfantines” are educational algorithms. The code has been commented to make it as easy to read as possible. Feedback appreciated.\n\n# PRINTING\n“Enfantines” are better printed in small size and big numbers, ideally on coloured paper that fits your iterations’s background. Contact me for a white background version of your iteration.",

Colors blend skillfully, creating the illusion of light and shadow, yet allowing one to feel the chill of moonlight and the lingering warmth of the setting sun.\n\nThe artist seems to have observed the shaping and destruction of the world with a detached perspective.

            "description": "\"Isometric Dreams\" is a visionary journey into the architectural essence of the mind's deepest narratives, set for release on the winter solstice, December 21st. This project invites viewers into a labyrinth of geometric splendor, mirroring the transition from the shortest day to the longest night.\n\nThe project comprises a series of digital canvases where light and shadow play across isometric landscapes, creating a cityscape of the subconscious. The vivid hues—fiery oranges, lush greens, and icy blues—burn and glow against the stark contrasts of shadow, symbolizing the ancient duality of the solstice: darkness surrendering to light.\n\nOn this most enigmatic of nights, when shadows stretch their longest and the veil between worlds grows thin, \"Isometric Dreams\" offers a visual homage to the mysteries of the unseen. The stark geometry, a nod to the order within chaos, contrasts with the swirling, dream-like quality of the overlaid patterns, suggests the intricate complexities of human cognition and the ethereal nature of our dreams.\n\nAlthough the artworks in this project are static, they evoke dynamic emotional and subconscious experiences. Each piece, unchanging in form, sparks a personal journey of perception and interpretation, connecting the viewer's inner world with the timeless themes of light, time, and cognition.\n\n3500x4953px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023",

Every day the same background color will appear at the same time as the previous day. This will give you a different experience based on the time that you watch the piece.\nThe chosen background colors and their order are based on the transaction hash.\n\nFollowing properties are also based on the transaction hash:\n- Canvas orientation\n- Color scheme\n- Number of lanes\n- Lane orientation\n- Existence of a shadow on the circles\n- Number of circles per lane\n- Full circles or outlines only\n\nPressing 'p' will pause and restart the animation.\nPressing 's' will save a jpg of the work at it's current dimensions.",
