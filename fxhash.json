Link at the bottom. If you’d rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

Link at the bottom. If you’d rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

            "description": "Comics were the trigger for my first absolute rapture. It was so intense that I couldn't wait to get home from school to dive into my secret box of comics and, for a few hours, escape to the world of superheroes. And, at least for a short time, be taken away from reality in which I was ostracized from society at school only because I liked math, and because I thought Spiderman and Batman were cool.\n\nDecades later, the only thing that can be compared to the appearance of comics is the discovery of generative art. I haven't felt such a boyish trance since the appearance of the comics. And nothing has come more naturally than trying to unite my two loves.\n\nThis piece tries to achieve a comic vibe using abstract shapes and tries to convey the texture of the paper, which was of poor quality but had the most beautiful smell in the world. It was a challenge to create dynamics, action, movement, fight, and childlike joy all at the same time. Each color palette is inspired by some of the most famous comic book heroes and villains. But by far the biggest challenge was making this piece a direct link to childhood for all of you.\n\nI sincerely hope that I succeeded.\n\n\nOptions:\n\n- press 's' to save the PNG image of the current view\n- press 'd' to save a hi-res PNG image\n\nCreated using p5.js\nBajiru, January 2023.",

            "description": "Comics were the trigger for my first absolute rapture. It was so intense that I couldn't wait to get home from school to dive into my secret box of comics and, for a few hours, escape to the world of superheroes. And, at least for a short time, be taken away from reality in which I was ostracized from society at school only because I liked math, and because I thought Spiderman and Batman were cool.\n\nDecades later, the only thing that can be compared to the appearance of comics is the discovery of generative art. I haven't felt such a boyish trance since the appearance of the comics. And nothing has come more naturally than trying to unite my two loves.\n\nThis piece tries to achieve a comic vibe using abstract shapes and tries to convey the texture of the paper, which was of poor quality but had the most beautiful smell in the world. It was a challenge to create dynamics, action, movement, fight, and childlike joy all at the same time. Each color palette is inspired by some of the most famous comic book heroes and villains. But by far the biggest challenge was making this piece a direct link to childhood for all of you.\n\nI sincerely hope that I succeeded.\n\n\nOptions:\n\n- press 's' to save the PNG image of the current view\n- press 'd' to save a hi-res PNG image\n\nCreated using p5.js\nBajiru, January 2023.",

Joy, sadness, anger, tranquility, confusion - to name a few, all these emotions makes us who we are today consciously or subconsciously. Yet, negative emotions are easier to remember and sticks longer compared to the positive ones.\n\nThough, some people are lucky enough to be able to express their emotions freely to their surrounding, letting others know what they're feeling & what they've been through. While some other finds it harder to let go of those negative emotions. Wanting them to be gone but, alas, they can't find the right conditions to do so. Or even worse, these emotions get mixed up and tangled with their thoughts and memories making it harder to read or express.\n\n__________\n\nObscure Archive is trying to capture what I (or maybe, you too) have been feeling constantly. These negative emotions is expressed and written as the text within the artwork, with the supergraphic representing thoughts & memories that we have. Some of the artwork has no overlay, just like those who can express their emotions freely. While some other have a completely different overlay, with messy text and supergraphic representing the concealment & entangled thoughts that make the emotions harder to read.\n\n__________\n\nmade with ❤️ and p5js",

            "description": "And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses\nHad the look of flowers that are looked at.\n- T.S. Eliot, Four Quartets: Burnt Norton (1936)\n\nThis work is an attempt to encapsulate in an algorithm, not the likeness of a flower, but the likeness of a painting of a flower. If, according to a very old definition, art is an imitation of nature, this is an imitation of an imitation – a sort of meta-imitation of nature by means of computer code.\n\nThe challenge for this piece was to capture some of the looseness and fluidity of the human hand when holding a brush or a pencil, and reproducing some typical forms of hand-made scribbles, doodles and brush strokes. However, absent the materiality of paint and canvas, everything is simulated here on the base of a very simple resource: circles. Everything you see is built of very many overlapping circles of varying sizes, colors and opacities. It is circles all the way down…\n\nInspiration for this work comes from a number of expressionist painters, from 20th century classics like Cy Twombly, to the magnificent contemporary work of Philip Maltman: https://www.instagram.com/philipmaltman/\n\nThis work is animated.\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 1000 x 1000 resolution. Please note that rendering at high resolutions can be slow.\n\nMade with the open-source libraries p5.js and chroma.js\n",

            "description": "A generative set of imaginary landscapes.\n\nTerrains continues a study of topographic media translations that began with Plastic Landscapes (2016) and our Field Guide to Martian Landscapes (2017). While the Field Guide focused on analyzing topographies of another planet, interpreted through telescopic imaging and software translation, this project focuses on the procedural generation of nonexistent landscapes. These landscapes are generated through a complex manipulation of perlin noise, a recurring algorithm used in videogames, film VFX, and generative art since the 1980s that resembles natural geological formations. By no means new, this tradition is part of a lineage of digital visualization projects focused on reproducing nature through algorithmic means. Our algorithm generates sequential bands of noise mapped on an X-Y plane, rendered in an oblique architectural projection, a techniques that comes from technical drawing conventions. This perspective produces a layering effect that flattens the terrain in an architectural way. Neither realistic nor completely abstract, the system plays with projection, entropy, and constraints to produce a collection of imaginary terrains sited on the Tezos blockchain.\n\nWe must also credit all who have explored this field of work: Ken Perlin, James M. Bardeen, Stephen Schmitt, Paul Bourke, Joseph Claghorn, Amit Patel, Inigo Quilez, Matt DesLauriers, and many many more...\n\nPress \"s\" to download PNG.\nPress \"r\" to redraw and shift stripes.\n\nBuilt with p5.js\nBy office ca\n2023",
