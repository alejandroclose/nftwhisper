We all feel this way from time to time — in our lives, jobs, bodies, situations — yet in our search for something, we shouldn't forget that there can still be beauty along the path.\n\nThe project takes some inspiration from Henri Matisse, both in the aesthetics of his later works (i.e. the \"Cut Outs\") and metaphorically in the sense that he had underwent medical treatment which left him wheelchair- or bed-bound towards the later part of his life, forcing him to give up painting, yet in his exploration of this new creative medium which involved cutting paper and pinning them up, his unorthodox work went on to become the most transformative of his career.\n\nReleased as part of the 4th edition of the Cure³ Parkinson's cure fundraiser exhibition organized by Artwise Curators and Bonhams as part of a specially comissioned selection of generative artists minting NFTs, curated by Foteini Valeonti and Alex Estorick with the support of fx(hash) at Bonhams, London from 13-17th January 2023.\n\n---\n33% of primary sales and 3% of secondary sales will be donated on-chain to Cure Parkinson’s\n---\n\nControls:\n• 'R' regenerates the piece (e.g. in case the window size changes)\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Jan 2023\nArtist: Yazid",

There are 17 figures that get combined and mixed over three layers. The figures vary in complexity but are generally created with vertical and horizontal lines only. Figures have at least one seed, some even have a seed per path. A seed is an oscillating pixel that can be compared to a square wave oscillator of audio synthesis and is usually followed by a path or a set of paths. The purpose of the paths is to send the pixels along the lines to make the figures visible through movement and to create a reduction to pure animation.\n\n👽 Kim Asendorf",

The robot is like an extension of the artist’s arm, allowing him to create infinite iterations and variations.\n\nThe dots pattern and their density help create the illusion of shadows, gradients and brightness, a technique inherited from the pointillism movement, born in Belgium and France in the late 19th century.\n",

We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "An important element of generative art is emergence. The most famous algorithm for this is probably Cellular Automata (CA).\n\nHowever, numerous generative artists have created works using CA, which has lost its visual freshness and is like chewing gum that has lost its taste.\n\nAlthough it is such a classic algorithm, adding my own little ideas to it and finding a new \"flavor\" is the reason why I code.\n\nHere, the subject is 1D Elementary Cellular Automata, the simplest of all cellular automata. 1D Elementary Cellular Automata has 256 different rules, which change the shapes produced. This work aims to create more complex shapes by randomly selecting some of those rules and placing multiple of them on the screen.\n\nThe on/off of the CA cell is often likened to the behavior of living creatures.As of 2022, in the country where I live, prices are rising, wages are not increasing, and COVID-19 has not yet ended. I created this work with the image of people at the mercy of these various rules.\n\n---\n\nScreen click: Change rules\nS key: Save png\nL key: Show/hide grid\n",

            "description": "Snake Alley is a place in my neighborhood where the sidewalk is narrowly bounded by low-hanging branches on one side and a steep ditch one the other. I have seen countless snakes dart across the sidewalk there at dusk. \n\nI always wind up at Snake Alley, wearing sandals, at dusk.\n\nThis generative system creates unique outputs for each hash. The compositions are organized like spokes through a series of concentric rings, like the Dharmachakra, however these are twisted and centered around an out-spiraling function. Higher-torque versions look more twisted and gnarled, while low-torque versions look like rays emanating from the center.\n\nA number of branches connect each outer ring with its adjacent, inner ring. The layers of branches fill the space with low, medium, or high density - full of circles drawn from the outer layers to the innermost layer. The circles themselves are small or large, within each output.\n\nFifteen color palettes named after different kinds of snakes were used to lightly color the edges, each drawn with equal likelihood. The titles and colors were adapted from different snake species, typically variants found in the southeastern US, when different colorations occur in other regions. The coral, corn, and milk snakes around Charleston have similar coloration in nature, and their similar color gradients reflect this fact.\n\nI originally composed this artwork in the R Statistics language. I translated the system to p5.js for the one-year anniversary of fxhash. Proceeds from sales will go to Processing.org, the organization that is developing p5.js. #fxhashturnsone \n\nVerified NFT collectors can purchase a fine art print for their unique token at vadenart.com\n\nAbout the artist: Kenny Vaden is a generative artist based in Charleston, SC. His art experience included drawing, painting, stained glass apprenticeships, and nature photography. Vaden’s code-based artworks are available online as limited edition or single edition fine art prints, as well as NFTs on Quantum.art, Flamingo DAO Flutter, OpenSea, Objkt, fxhash, and Foundation.

The UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity beautifully states, “As a source of exchange, innovation and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature.”  Who better to usher in an age of true appreciation for, and active promotion of cultural diversity than a community of artists and collectors.\n\nExcerpts from the UNESCO declaration are embedded in the piece in the form of asemic writing, infusing the piece with the power of the message as it charms the eye.  The collector will also be able to select one of twenty affirmations to be embedded in the work.  Each minted edition will stand as a prayer flag waving permanently on the blockchain spreading its message of belief in a world where we are all valued and respected.  Cry Diversity will be free to collect, but it comes with a challenge.  The collector is expected to actively research the cryptoArt community to find an artist new to them that is a member of an underrepresented group (female, LBGTQIA2+, female identifying, non-binary, POC, global south, etc.).  They are then expected to actively promote that artist and their work for at least one week.  They are expected to personally raise their voice.  Cry Diversity is the second in a series of projects (see the companion piece fx(elevate)) designed to bring attention to individual artists as well as to the value of true commitment to diversity within our community.  It will not be the last.\n\nIt is time to make our cries heard and our actions felt!\n\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint a free edition.

            "description": "Cry Diversity is just that - a cry for greater diversity and equality in the genArt community. The UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity beautifully states, “As a source of exchange, innovation and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature.”  Who better to usher in an age of true appreciation for, and active promotion of cultural diversity than a community of artists and collectors.\n\nExcerpts from the UNESCO declaration are embedded in the piece in the form of asemic writing, infusing the piece with the power of the message as it charms the eye.  The collector will also be able to select one of twenty affirmations to be embedded in the work.  Each minted edition will stand as a prayer flag waving permanently on the blockchain spreading its message of belief in a world where we are all valued and respected.  Cry Diversity will be free to collect, but it comes with a challenge.  The collector is expected to actively research the cryptoArt community to find an artist new to them that is a member of an underrepresented group (female, LBGTQIA2+, female identifying, non-binary, POC, global south, etc.).  They are then expected to actively promote that artist and their work for at least one week.  They are expected to personally raise their voice.  Cry Diversity is the second in a series of projects (see the companion piece fx(elevate)) designed to bring attention to individual artists as well as to the value of true commitment to diversity within our community.  It will not be the last.\n\nIt is time to make our cries heard and our actions felt!\n\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint a free edition.  Beginning in the 2nd week, the project will be open to the public for an additional week. Un-minted editions will be burned at the expiration of the 2nd week.\n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Choose your Cry.  Lock it.\n4) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \na) Seed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you have recorded the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the seed to retrieve it.\nb) Cry: What do you want our community to symbolize?  Respect, diversity, compassion?  Choose your favorite characteristic.  It will be baked into your output.\n\nProject Details:\nThis work uses the spectral.js library for the development of color palettes. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in June, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download. Press [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for printing.  \n",
