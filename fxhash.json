            "description": "#fxhashturnsone\n\nThe first 365 crazy days of fxhash - time to celebrate this and take a look back.\n\nThe entropy of memories in a vivid photo collage that gives me goosebumps while others might just see moving eye candy. Perspective and perception can be so different.\n\nBased on some of my photos from the last 365 days that trigger emotional memories, even if they are not directly connected. By the way, Fischbach is the name of the small village where I grew up. It was a great time!\n\nHow does it work?\n\nEach piece uses pairs of photos and colors (top/bottom).\n\nThe animated collage itself is based on two layers. The first layer uses a double buffer to cut, colorize and animate the photos. The second layer is mainly just for screen rendering, debugging and behind-the-scene looks.\n\nCutting and pasting photos is based on a variable moving color grid, the fixed horizon, the variable position of the photos top/bottom, the previous buffer and some magic distance calculations between them.\n\nThe grid itself is a combination of vertical color stripes with variable position and distance factors that determine the color gradient between the two colors, and folds that alternate between the two colors depending on the horizontal and vertical values.\n\nEspecially the entropy of the photos and the colored grid influence the pixel movement.\n\nAnimation changes are triggered after a random number of frames and effect folds, stripes and photo position. These replace parts of the current collage (fade to black) or add some (discard fragment updates).\n\nFeatures:\n\n- top color [12] - hue, colorful & bright\n- bottom color [6] - hue, less colorful & bright\n- top photo [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ♠4, driften, brand-pyramide, zäpfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- bottom photo: [16] (zingst, birds, xmas, zustand, zebra, moving-blocks-mono, fischbach, santanyi, goldblume, ♠4, driften, brand-pyramide, zäpfle, bc, tisa, lieblingspulli)\n- horizon [0.618, 0.5, 0.382] (down, center, up)\n- hectic [3, 5, 11] (calm, slightly, very)\n- horizontal folds [113, 365, 997, 2153, 3987] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- vertical folds [7, 37, 127, 571, 1501, 3147] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n- min stripes [1, 3, 5] - used for first animation iteration, variable\n\nAnimation and feature selection are based on the deterministic prng Xoshiro128 seeded with the fxhash. This allows repeated playback in the same sequence. The animation is synchronized with frames and not with time.\n\nThe preview images are taken after 300 frames.\n\nShortcuts & interactions:\n\n- spacebar, mouse click or tap touch to trigger animation changes\n- `c` to take a picture\n- `f` for full screen mode\n- `p` to pause\n- `h` to see all options\n\nAvailable query string parameters:\n\n- autopause - enable automatic pausing\n- pixelratio=2 - sets the pixel ratio (default: device)\n- showannouncement - activates the announcement\n- kioskspeed=10 - activates the kiosk mode and sets the speed in seconds\n- showinfo - activates the info box",

            "description": "This series is about finding the beauty in discarded things. It's about seeing the potential for art in the most unexpected places and creating something new from what already exists.\n\nOne thing we love about art is that it can be a direct expression of our thoughts and feelings. But what about the happy accidents that can happen when we let go and allow the materials to guide us?\n\nI love the serendipitous moments that arise when I relinquish control, letting the materials show me the way. The printmaking process can be messy and unpredictable. I often use sheets of notebook paper to keep my workspace clean. When I’m done, I save some of the scrap sheets of paper. \n\nThe mark of a dirty brayer, drips of paint, a coffee stain, or a ripped edge can all be embraced as part of the final composition. A similar process happens in generative art, where projects can have near limitless possibilities.\n\nSheets of paper can represent many things: a blank slate, an adventure, or even noise. This project is dedicated to all the leftovers and forgotten things in the world. It's a reminder that even the smallest piece of paper can be beautiful.",

            "description": "“Klyft” is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at PARIS+ par Art Basel.\n\nKlyft is a juxtaposition of two different projections for the future. One, made by the World Economic Forum, suggests that the global gender gap will have closed by the year 2154. The other, by the UN IPCC, estimates that global warming will reach 3.2 degrees celcius by the year 2100.\n\nKlyft makes use of the unique temporal aspect of computational art by developing its expression gradually over the next 132 years. As we come closer to 2154, the space between the two shapes in Klyft will grow smaller to symbolize the closing of the gender gap. As time goes on, however, Klyft also becomes more and more glitched out to represent the projected increases in greenhouse gases and climate catastrophes.\n\nIn the end, Klyft’s expression will be heavily corrupted, and the two shapes will have reached each other.\n\n· URL parameters ·\n\nYou can add the following parameters to the URL to change the behavior of the piece.\n\ndate=<YYYY-MM-DD> — See how Klyft looks on another day. Use the format YYYY-MM-DD. \n\ncolor=<number> — See the piece in another color scheme. The numbers loop around, so 17 equals 0, 18 equals 1, etc. \n\nresolution=<number> — View the piece in a higher resolution. 1 is normal resolution, 2 is double, etc. No decimals allowed.\n\nimage=true — Save the piece as an image. \n\nrecord=true — Save the piece as a video in WEBM format.\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will show Klyft in double resolution on the day gender equality is achieved according to the WEF:\n\ndate=2154-01-01&resolution=2\n\nAdding the following URL parameters will save a video of Klyft in the ‘Stokkendahl Dalgas’ color scheme:\n\ncolor=14&record=true\n\n· Interactions ·\n\nPressing the following keys will trigger functionality as well as add related URL parameters automatically. \n\nPressing D will increment the date by 1 year.\n\nPressing C will increment the color index by 1.\n\nPressing R will toggle between normal and double resolution.\n\nPressing I will toggle the image URL parameter, which saves the piece as an image. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nPressing V will toggle the video URL parameter, which saves the piece as a video. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nThere are secret key presses as well. Some of them only work outside of iframe. \n\n· Accessibility ·\n\nKlyft is built to support screen readers. It has been tested using MacOS’ VoiceOver, and uses p5.js’ describeElement() to provide screen reader functionality.\n\nIf you have any comments (good or bad) on the screen reader integration, don’t hesitate to reach out on my Twitter: @ada_ada_ada_art. \n\n· Credits and license ·\n\nKlyft is made with p5.js.\n\nKlyft is licensed under a modified version of the Climate Strike License (CSL).",

Since 1927, only nine drops of pitch have fallen, and it has never been witnessed live.\n\nAll That Could Be is about the inner life of pitch drops waiting for their inevitable fall.\n\nAfter first learning of the pitch drop experiment and understanding what this odd hyper-viscous liquid was… all I could think about was: How does the pitch feel about all of this? What does it dream of? How does it deal with this intense pressure to snap, drip and perform?\n\nAll That Could Be acts as a metaphysical microscope into the emotional state of the pitch. The anticipated explosion of energy and pain when it loses its battle with gravity… as well as daydreams imagined to brighten its dark, slow existence with vibrant, static-y layers… or fantasies of being anywhere else besides trapped in a funnel under a locked encasement for the entertainment/curiosity of others who just hope to see you snap into two.\n\nFor more info:\nhttps://hereandnow.events/\n\nProcure a coin to participate in the event:\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/slug/here-and-now:-edition-5\n\n————\n\nSome key commands in live mode:\n\nG : Toggle grain\nA : Toggle aura\nS : Save current resolution\n1 : 3000x3750\n2 : 4500x5625\n3 : 6000x7500\n4 : 7500x9375\n5 : 9000x11250\n6 : 10500x13125\n(1-6 work best on Chrome/Edge)\n(rendering takes longer as resolution increases)",

These are not friendly guides; they are silent arbiters of the unknown, both protectors and judges of the enigma that is their terrain. As you gaze into their world, let these haunting apparitions remind you of the vastness of the cosmos. \n\nThe SENTINELS beckon you to explore the sinister beauty of the abyss, to question, and to wander through a digital realm where the eerie and the captivating coexist.\n\nParanoia is a necessary skill whenever a SENTINEL is involved.\n \nSENTINELS is not only an exploration of the sublime-it also empowers collectors to generate physical artifacts from the void. With a keystroke, you choose your format:\n\nPress ‘s’ or ‘1’ to save a compact version\n‘2’ for a print-ready image\n‘3’ for a high-resolution image",

            "description": "Giorgio de Chirico was a prominent influence on the Surrealist movement. De Chirico’s art portrays dream-like and distorted worlds that encourage viewers to explore their subconscious. \n\nI am fascinated by the different ways artists have found to express esoteric concepts. In particular, I am interested in how artists like Giorgio de Chirico have used light and color to create ethereal images. \n\nI believe that the Abstract Temples project is a perfect example of how generative art can be used to create metaphysical artwork. By invoking the visual language of the dream world, these images invite you to explore the nebulous relationship between external and internal space.\n\nIn addition to the influence of Giorgio de Chirico, I would also like to credit James Turrell as an inspiration for this project. Turrell is an artist who creates installations that play with our perception of light and space. Turrell’s work has profoundly impacted my understanding of how art can create an immersive and disorienting experience. \n\nEach temple room is randomly generated from a selection of 16 templates. The templates include a variety of randomized features, including the color palette, celestial objects, design variations, and other effects. They also contain a rare secret. \n\nThis project was created with p5js. \n\nFeatures:\n-16 room templates\n-18 color palettes\n-Celestial objects\n-Secrets",
