            "description": "Within each of us resides an evolutionary history of primal emotions, yet we often spend our lives dulling and controlling these instincts rather than reveling in them. Art is one of the ways we best express those instincts and intuitions – accessing and visualizing their visceral qualities, and releasing our deepest emotions in a way we can share.\n\npang reflects emotions that take control of our impulses – anguish, euphoria, obsession. By using crayon-like marks, the artworks convey the catharsis felt while drawing with a childlike abandon. To capture what gives such marks true feeling, the works deliberate the intrinsic movements, pressures, and angles shaped by hands in various moods. These qualities and their frenetic meanderings represent the infinite possibilities of where the crayon could go next – if only we could free ourselves from the layers of control we've built.\n\nThe contradictions we struggle with are reflected throughout the works:  in the long, methodical, and mathematical path to creation that yields work that looks fast, free and unrehearsed;  through the randomly-informed computer generation of art that feels human;  and by the depiction of long-standing traditional techniques to help display the conceptual range of a young, innovative art movement still establishing its pivotal place in the canon of art. These tensions parallel the work's underlying concept, accentuating the suspicion that a learned fear of emotional expression might just be the source of our own pang. \n\nCreated in p5.js, pang is inspired by the emotional works and processes of later abstract expressionists such as Cy Twombly and Joan Mitchell – as well as contemporary artists like José Parla.\n\nFunctionality: \nPress ‘p’ to save as a png. \nPress ‘b’ to render with (or without) a transparent background.\nPress 0-9 to render at varying degrees of quality.  0 (lowest quality) to 9 (highest quality, 15000 pixels lengthwise).\nPress ⬆️ (arrow up) to incrementally increase pixel density.\nPress ⬇️ (arrow down) to incrementally decrease pixel density.\n\n__________\nTENDER x abstractment\nApril 2022\n",

            "description": "Within each of us resides an evolutionary history of primal emotions, yet we often spend our lives dulling and controlling these instincts rather than reveling in them. Art is one of the ways we best express those instincts and intuitions – accessing and visualizing their visceral qualities, and releasing our deepest emotions in a way we can share.\n\npang reflects emotions that take control of our impulses – anguish, euphoria, obsession. By using crayon-like marks, the artworks convey the catharsis felt while drawing with a childlike abandon. To capture what gives such marks true feeling, the works deliberate the intrinsic movements, pressures, and angles shaped by hands in various moods. These qualities and their frenetic meanderings represent the infinite possibilities of where the crayon could go next – if only we could free ourselves from the layers of control we've built.\n\nThe contradictions we struggle with are reflected throughout the works:  in the long, methodical, and mathematical path to creation that yields work that looks fast, free and unrehearsed;  through the randomly-informed computer generation of art that feels human;  and by the depiction of long-standing traditional techniques to help display the conceptual range of a young, innovative art movement still establishing its pivotal place in the canon of art. These tensions parallel the work's underlying concept, accentuating the suspicion that a learned fear of emotional expression might just be the source of our own pang. \n\nCreated in p5.js, pang is inspired by the emotional works and processes of later abstract expressionists such as Cy Twombly and Joan Mitchell – as well as contemporary artists like José Parla.\n\nFunctionality: \nPress ‘p’ to save as a png. \nPress ‘b’ to render with (or without) a transparent background.\nPress 0-9 to render at varying degrees of quality.  0 (lowest quality) to 9 (highest quality, 15000 pixels lengthwise).\nPress ⬆️ (arrow up) to incrementally increase pixel density.\nPress ⬇️ (arrow down) to incrementally decrease pixel density.\n\n__________\nTENDER x abstractment\nApril 2022\n",

            "description": "This is my little tribute to fx (hash and fam).\n\nDuring an important phone call, I was put on hold. Unconsciously, I began to scribble in my sketchbook. Research shows that scribbling helps focusing, but I dreamed away nonetheless until my pages were filled with scribbles, notes, shopping and a to-do list. \n\nMint a uniquely generated page from my non-existent 100% coded sketchbook (except text typography). \n\nThe page may contain many scribbles and drawings in pen, felt-tip pen, pencil, or less: often references to artists I admire, some in the form of loose scribbles, others in the form of riddles. Those drawings are drawn with code and vary. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to incorporate tributes to all art and every artist I admire. The sketchbook would never finish. Thanks to rudxane I know that it’s ok to publish something unfinished ;-). \n\nOne reference that appears in every token is to Sol Lewitt, an incredible source of inspiration. His artworks consist of instructions. Your sketch book pages contain instructions too. You will find the instructions for the artwork scribbled on your unique page by pressing i.\n\nCurious how the work would look without the ‘distracting’ scribbles and coffee stains? Press ‘a’, ‘w’, or ‘g’. \n\n800 x 800 px\n\nPress ‘s’ to save an image.\n\nMade with p5js and the amazing p5.scribble.js library by Janneck Wullschleger.\n\nFont used: Sacremento-Regular under the SIL Open Font License (OFL).\n\nSee license.md for the licenses of both.\n\nThank you all!

The additional perceived movements are generated by the difficulty of completely eliminating the aliasing of almost vertical lines. Small rescaling of the frames makes the configurations and their transformations even more elaborate. \n\nThe movements of all lines and the rescaling of the frames are determined by eight parameters with decimal values. The cycles that are generated can therefore have quite long durations.\n\nAntonio Belluscio (@livinbits)\nOctober 2017 - April 2022\n\nViewing in fullscreen mode and landscape orientation is recommended.\nThe algorithm was implemented in p5.js without using shaders.",

            "description": "Within each of us resides an evolutionary history of primal emotions, yet we often spend our lives dulling and controlling these instincts rather than reveling in them. Art is one of the ways we best express those instincts and intuitions – accessing and visualizing their visceral qualities, and releasing our deepest emotions in a way we can share.\n\npang reflects emotions that take control of our impulses – anguish, euphoria, obsession. By using crayon-like marks, the artworks convey the catharsis felt while drawing with a childlike abandon. To capture what gives such marks true feeling, the works deliberate the intrinsic movements, pressures, and angles shaped by hands in various moods. These qualities and their frenetic meanderings represent the infinite possibilities of where the crayon could go next – if only we could free ourselves from the layers of control we've built.\n\nThe contradictions we struggle with are reflected throughout the works:  in the long, methodical, and mathematical path to creation that yields work that looks fast, free and unrehearsed;  through the randomly-informed computer generation of art that feels human;  and by the depiction of long-standing traditional techniques to help display the conceptual range of a young, innovative art movement still establishing its pivotal place in the canon of art. These tensions parallel the work's underlying concept, accentuating the suspicion that a learned fear of emotional expression might just be the source of our own pang. \n\nCreated in p5.js, pang is inspired by the emotional works and processes of later abstract expressionists such as Cy Twombly and Joan Mitchell – as well as contemporary artists like José Parla.\n\nFunctionality: \nPress ‘p’ to save as a png. \nPress ‘b’ to render with (or without) a transparent background.\nPress 0-9 to render at varying degrees of quality.  0 (lowest quality) to 9 (highest quality, 15000 pixels lengthwise).\nPress ⬆️ (arrow up) to incrementally increase pixel density.\nPress ⬇️ (arrow down) to incrementally decrease pixel density.\n\n__________\nTENDER x abstractment\nApril 2022\n",
