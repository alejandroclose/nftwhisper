            "description": "This project was started in December 2021. At that time, I didn't know what the result would be. It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

            "description": "-Satellites-\n\nThe Space Probe project was humanity's bold endeavor to explore the universe beyond our own solar system. At the height of the space race between the years 2400 and 2500, hundreds of probe satellites were sent out into the unknown, each with a unique mission to collect data on distant galactic objects and search for signs of life and habitable planets.\nAs the probes ventured to the edge of the solar system and beyond, they extended humanity's reach and understanding of the universe. Many of these probes were equipped with the ability to communicate their findings back to Earth, allowing us to delve deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos.\nThe probes took many forms, including galactic probes, communication satellites, and planetary probes designed for sample return. As they floated in the vast wasteland that surrounds the Milky Way galaxy, these probes searched for organic molecules, the building blocks of life, and conducted their missions with determination.\nAlthough some of the probes have since become redundant, they continue to float through the void, reminders of humanity's unending quest for knowledge and discovery in the universe. The Space Probe project was a landmark achievement, pushing the boundaries of human understanding and paving the way for further exploration of the cosmos.\n\nX to toggle the Animation (on/off)\nR to reset\n\nBuild with WebGL\nGert-Jan Akerboom - 2023\n\n(20% of primary sales will go to girlswhocode.com)\n",

            "description": "\"Euphoria\" embodies my pleasurable exploration and playfulness in geometry to produce a whole unit of an image that reminds me of my old cubist painting exercises. \"Euphoria\" ends from diagonal lines to different levels of flat color, surfaces, and shapes. The scene of this work in forms creates small boxes with fragile perspectives; this performance challenges the root concept that art should copy nature. A theme that is evident in all my works. Therefore, the unusual geometrical divisions generate outstanding space in the flat forms.\nAngles are generated that may simultaneously form a two-way perspective. It is a sensory experience imposed by the \"external sense\" and time similarly by the \"internal sense.\" It is the experience of a visual world that combines the visual aura of space and time. According to Kant, such a combination is the foundation of self-awareness.\nAccording to him, intuitions should \"move through each other and be held together.\" That is, they should be placed in time and some of them in place (the spatial component appears as a position outside intuition). Second, the previous intuitions must be placed next to the current intuitions to form a single body.\nThis process constitutes the initial formalist. Such a method is undoubtedly an attempt to abandon all resemblance to natural form and to create a completely abstract language of form, including a visual symphony. \"Euphoria\" strives to achieve abstract minimalism by exploring new geometric structures, using algorithms, and building them into code structures.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

            "description": "This is an algorithmic tribute to the pioneering work of Anna Atkins (1799-1871). Considered by many the first female photographer, Atkins learned about the cyanotype process soon after it was invented by John Herschel, a family friend. As a botanist, she had the idea of using the new technique to produce contact prints of plants. Her investigations succeeded in capturing the nuances in morphology and the delicate details of many species.\n\nIn 1843 she published “British Algae: Cyanotype impressions”, the first published book to use a photographic process for the illustrations. Each copy gathered around 400 prints, each of them individually produced from a different specimen. Thus, all books featured the same species, but each of them was different, in a process that was itself generative in a certain way. Today, about 17 copies of the book are preserved in different institutions. Atkins went on to publish two more books in the following years, with the help of her friend Anne Dixon, dedicated to various ferns and plants.\n\n“Cyanotypes” pays homage to her wonderful work, which sits at the intersection between science and art, and used technology in a novel way to capture the beauty of nature. Here things are taken one step forward, to generate algorithmic simulations of plants, ferns, and algae, which are the work of fantasy and not necessarily faithful to the traits of any real species.\n\nThe work features 28 basic configurations, each of them in turn capable of unlimited variations. As was the case with the prints from “British Algae”, every image is at the same time part of a series and unique. \n\nControls:\n[SPACE] to play/pause\n[r] to restart the drawing\n[f] to toggle fullscreen\n[s] to download capture\n[2] to [9] to generate and save a hi-res image at multiples of the original 800 x 1000 resolution. Please note that rendering at high resolutions can be very slow.\n\nMade with p5.js. \n",
