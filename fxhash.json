            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

It is usually a central visual element that attracts viewers' attention and draws them to the designated main path.\nI experimented a little more creatively with this design to leave a lasting impression on those who encounter it. I want to invite viewers on a journey of exploration and introspection. Furthermore, I want to create a spark in the viewer's thinking and invite him to interpret it.\nIts importance lies not only in its aesthetic appeal but also in its ability to provoke thought and inspire conversation among viewers.\nOverall, \"The Main Path\" is a powerful expression of beauty, captivating audiences with its depth and ability to transcend boundaries.\n\nMade by p5.js\ns = save",

            "description": "\"Somewhere in Between\" is part of the interactive minting experience at Proof of X with KUMALEON, Tokyo, 2023 - Blockchain as a new Medium for Art held at The Face in Daikanyama.\n\nSomewhere in Between is a token that plays with geometry and color - reusing a previous algorithmic strategy for creating irregular grids, the main topic this time was splitting up rectangular regions in various manners. Each rectangle has a number of sockets distributed evenly along it's edges, these sockets can then be connected at random, without intersecting each other. Based on these connections we can then identify different polygonal regions with a contour walking approach. The rectangles are then split into these polygonal regions. That is the essence of this generative piece.\n\nThe Parameters:\n1. This token is tied to the minter address - WYSIWYG - randomness is therefore derived off of that address. This first slider adds an offset to the initial seed, to allow you to explore a couple of variations.\n2. The overall color scheme applied to the rectangular regions.\n3. The background color - each scheme has a different set of background colors.\n4. The overall scale of the grid - a larger grid will be more cluttered and hold more rectangles, a smaller one will be more spacious.\n5. The overall slant of the hachure lines - there's three different modes: random, vertical and slanted.\n\nOther Instructions:\nAdd '&rez=[an integer]' to the url to obtain a higher resolution. 3-4 work best, higher pixel densities will take longer to compute.

            "description": "🔥 BURN NOTICE: This is a FIVE DAY \"open edition\" to celebrate the launch of fx(params). The project is open for minting from the start of Monday until midnight Friday (GMT).\n\nYYYSEED is an artwork with an aesthetic that works across digital, print and pen plotting mediums, leaning towards the minimalistic nature of drawing machines. SVGs can be exported for this purpose.\n\nI've designed the algorithm to work best for this with the default settings, you should be good to go right out of the box. You can explore the design space a little further using the parameters (more details below).\n\nIf you're planning on plotting the work at larger sizes (A2, A1), then the \"Override suggest lines\" is there for you to cram more of them into the extra space.\n\nPARAMS ::::::::::::::\n\nThe initial settings of the parameters are what I think best for the look I'm trying to achieve as the artist: minimal pen plotting work. This comes from the \"Suggested\" and \"Random for hash\" values.\n\nYou can take the design away from that by turning the \"Use suggested lines\" and \"Use suggested destroyer\" options off, and using your own values with the slider.\n\n\"Random for hash\" means the feature has been randomly selected and fixed for the current hash and won't change. For example, if the hash is 'ooABCD' and the grid's \"Random for hash\" picks 3x4, then it will always be 3x4 for that hash, it isn't random each time you change sometime. Picking a new hash however will then randomly pick a new (fixed) option.\n\nDANGER SEED :::::::::\n\nUSE OF THE DANGER SEED IS NOT RECOMMENDED. If you set the DANGER SEED, the value will be encoded along with the rest of the params (where it can be decoded) in the stored data of the mint, along with the token.\n\nThe DANGER SEED will only take effect if it starts with 'YYY', it will STOMP all over the other settings, including the hash.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS ::::::::\n\nh - Toggle highres mode on/off (starts off)\nt - Toggle paper background on/off\ns - Save png (in highres if toggled on)\n1-6 - Save SVGs for plotting A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6\n\nPEN PLOTTING ::::::::\n\nPress 1-6 to select which A1-6 size paper you want to plot onto, the the system will download one or more files for you to use, one file per colour.\n\nPlease tag #plottertwitter, or #penplotter on twitter, instagram & mastodon\n\nPRINTING ::::::::::::\n\nThe output of the high resolution version is 6,144 x 8,192 pixels. That will print at the following sizes.\n\n300dpi: 20.48 x 27.31 inches (52.02 x 69.35 cm)\n200dpi: 30.72 x 40.96 inches (78.03 x 104.03 cm)\n\n300dpi is recommended, but 200dpi should be fine for this design. I suggest turning the paper texture off if you're printing onto textured archival paper, you can leave it on when printing onto smooth white paper.",

Tip: toggle verbose mode on to see what parameter is connected to the controller.\n\nAvailable controller types:\nknob, drum pad, fader, modwheel, XY, thumbstick, arrow, toggle\n\nParameters to explore (non-exhaustive list)\n- fx: delay, distortion, filter, reverb\n- amplitude and frequency modulation\n- ADSR envelope shaping\n- oscillator specific parameters\n- and many more\n\n///\n\nIMPORTANT NOTES (known bugs, disclaimers and stuff)\n\n- This is an ART project in the first place and so it is not intented to be a professional tool or musical instrument in any way, thus please treat it accordingly.\n- The project uses WebAudio technology, which can be CPU and/or memory-intensive in some cases. Also, browsers may implement it differently, so if you run into bad sound problems (lagging, clipping, extreme distorion etc.) please try another browser or a computer with dedicated sound card if possible. (Created and constantly tested in Safari and Chrome on a 2015 MacBook Pro and 2016 iMac respectively).\n- Sometimes these bad sound problems also occur when your computer audio output is changed on the fly (putting in or pulling out headphones for example). Please restart your browser in this case.\n- Sound recording doesn't always work consistently, causing the recorded file may won't be saved. It is probably a bug I couldn't figure out yet, so this feature should be treated as experimental. If this happens, please reload/restart your browser and try again.\n- The project is fully coded. No additional image or audio resource is used to create the final result.\n- Just have fun and be creative :)\n\n///\n\nCreated with P5.js and P5.sound and using Chirag Mehta's excellent ntc.js (Name that Color Javascript) library. \n\n☁︎\n\ncloudnoise © 2023\n",
