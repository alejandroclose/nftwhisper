            "description": "I met an old man at the bar in a pub in Ireland. As it usually happens after a few pints of Guinness we started talking. \n\nHe said how he spent his entire working life on an ocean-going ship, was in danger many times due to storms, and how he couldn't wait to retire and firmly set foot on land, finally spending time with his family, especially grandchildren. \n\nAnd that now as an old man, he is happiest on summer evenings, when the full moon lights up everything, he lies out on the grassy part of the beach and looks at the sea through the grass. I asked him why through the grass? He said - \"I can't live without the sea, and looking at it through the grass is solid proof that I'm really on land after so many years, and that I'm not dreaming after all.\" \n\nThis work is a dedication to that old man. I recently found out from my Irish friends that he died few months ago at age of 87. His ashes were scattered on the grassy part of the beach. Now he is forever close to his sea, but still firmly on land, which he has been striving for for years.\n\nSláinte mr. Doyle.\n\nMade in p5.js\nBajiru, November 2022.",

            "description": "\"Aerial\" is a generative (100% code) abstract artwork, emphasizing to texturing and painting surface aging wear, inspired by surfaces with erosion - corrosion, craquelure (cracks), scratches, etc for example old drying oil or tempera painting in materials like canvas, wall, stone or wood. \n\nThe abstract shapes in many cases resemble like aerial eye view formations which gave and the name to this collection.\n\nThe input for each iteration is some simple geometry (boxes) i \"draw\" in a WebGL canvas, using for variation perlin noise values. Then manipulate the pixels and perform color mapping (color values from my palettes) inside a GLSL shader. \n\n\"Aerial\" includes 49 palettes (with several colors each) that have been stored externally (in the application folder) as Adobe \".act\" color table files so that avoiding hard coding (including all palettes in the code) consuming in this way resources eg. memory from user's system. I just load only the one palette i am going to use\n\nAll are 100% code, no images used.\n\nCONTROLS\n\nKEYS:\n\n- 1-3: Set resolution from 1x to 3x of the current dimension (possibly slower performance in higher values)\n- T: switch texture on/off\n- S: Save a png file with the current resolution\n\n- P: Change orientation to Portrait (default) with aspect ratio 0.85\n- L: Change orientation to Landscape\n- O: Change orientation to Square (box)\n  Due to some 1:1 ratio sensitive calculations, rendering output may differ when switching orientations or resizing\n\n----\nMade with p5js and custom shaders\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\nWant to know more ? please read the \"SHORT BIO\" section here in \"Emotions\" collection: https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/22243\n\n© Feb. 2023  @Uniray_net | uniray.net",

            "description": "This generative projects employs a vector field created by composing various functions based on a \"genome\".\n\nAlthough I tried to expose only those parameters that collectors care about, there are a few things to keep in mind while playing with them: The \"Manual genome\" parameter is only considered when \"Random genome\" boolean is `false`. Also the genome can be composed only of lowercase and uppercase alphabetical letters.\n\nAn easy trick to find a genome on your liking is to first check the \"Random genome\" control while you use the randomize parameters. Once you found one, you can copy from features and paste it on \"Manual genome\" field and uncheck the random.\n\nFor the sake of feedback I included a small text bases progress indicator on the upper left corner. Also in the same corner I included a link that will start rendering higher version.\n\nThe resolution of the rendering is 1024 x 1024 / aspect ratio. The higher version is 4096 x 4096 / aspect ratio.\n\nThe 50% of royalties go to the minter.\n\nPress 's' key to save a png.\nClick on canvas to watch the rendering at 100% zoom factor.\nClick it again to return to the scaled to fit the window.",

            "description": "Flowers and Sky\n\nUsing natural brushstrokes and bright colors, this generative system creates stunning scenes of flower-filled meadows under a brilliant sky. It is inspired by the masters of impressionist art and aims to capture the beauty of nature.\n\nEvery leaf, petal, cloud, and sunray are generated from code using simulated brushstrokes. The flowers and trees are suggestive only and do not depict real species.\n\nThere are 8 formal features that have many values in order to generate a wide variety of outputs. The only rare feature is a SkyMode of 'Eclipse' which occurs in 3% of the outputs.\n\n--------------------------\n\nThis is a 100% code generated project. Outputs are created at a default resolution of 1500 x 1000.\n\nClick on the output and use these keys to change the resolution or save the output:\n's' - save at current resolution\n\n'2' - change to  3000 x 2000 resolution\n'3' - change to  4500 x 3000 resolution\n...\n'8' - change to 12000 x 8000 resolution\n\nURL Parameters: You can also set the resolution in the url.\nTo change the resolution append &res=2 (or 3-8)\n\nCopyright 2023 Jeff Clark",
