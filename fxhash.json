And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions.

The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists.

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px).

It comes from Thebaid, an arid region of ancient Egypt and Thebes was the capital.\n\n“thébaïde” is my debut on fx(hash), almost one year since my first works minted on Objkt (a series of Indian ink drawings, in January 2022). After learning the basics of creative coding recently, and a few works with this technique, I decided to create a first generative project. With \"thébaïde\" I chose to express the minimalist and narrative aspects of my artistic approach (though the title and concept emerged at the end). Gradually the work was resonating with philosophical matters I'm obsessed with since years: time, emptiness, human condition, erosion, desire, chance, combining them into a visual metaphor. The view of a vast area, a changing silhouette, an impenetrable monolith or an opening to elsewhere or nothing, day and night and day and night and dawn and dusk — few elements able to compose a meditative and lasting tableau of questions and feelings.\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work.\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 px x 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.com",

Perfect example for emergence, how simple even byte-size rules result in complex structures, forming patterns and unpredictable behaviors...\n\nThis one is simple, 1d elementary cellular automata and the 256 rules as the foundation, where each iteration consists of the following elements: base rules - 3 are selected and allocated into the start row compositions, a set of shapes is assigned to a grid of various sizes. Occasionally, dynamic rule set is added - where a rule is randomly transformed into another random rule on a random row of the grid. A vertical or horizontal alignment of the grid is chosen an a color set assigned. Sometimes, a simple 2d noise is applied to lighten (or well, darken) things a bit. The grid is finite and confined by the amount of cells in a row and amount of rows fitting the canvas given cell size.\n\nThe properties are recorded as features, more as a reference to the building blocks, rather then rarity indication.

From there, I specifically developed it with non-plotter printing in mind, and more specific still, Riso Printing (think a scanner with a digital screen-printer MacGyver’d on). The palettes are taken from hex-estimated Risograph colour gamuts, with three layers being multiplied together to replicate, to some degree, the blending of the semi-transparent Risographic inks. Within this study, there’s a few different things going on, the initial setup is rectangles which cascade down the canvas, inheriting more extreme rotation as they get closer to the bottom (a la Schotter). The second is a subdivision of the shapes with filled circled, outlined circles and squares — since in this study the base shapes are rectangles and not squares, distribution of the ‘dithering’ can be larger than a single ‘pixel’ size — when these multiple layers overlap, the shapes produce a halftone-moire effect, forms and structures appear from the noise as the underlying patterns intersect. \n\ntx: Who?, Cosimo, Liam Egan, Andreas Rau, Louis\n\nLicensing: CC-BY-NC-ND ",

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px). It may last for high numbers.\nWe recommend the use of Chrome browser in order to render properly the texture.\n\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 × 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.net",

            "description": "Form, an essential aspect in architectural design, refers to the shape, structure and arrangement of spaces or objects. Witnessing how forms work in a space can also be a transcendental experience, where one can sense the presence of a form, not only seeing it.\n\nAs there are many ways to create it, Form can appear as an internal structure, as an external shape of a two dimensional plane that envelopes a three dimensional mass, or a repetition of a two dimensional shape that stacks on an axis and moves to a certain direction. With so many ways to create shape, there is no law dictating that shape has to be rigid. And this is where Milunic and Gehry's design for the Dancing House comes in as an inspiration for this work.\n\nA change in the political axis from one of a regime to a parliamentary democracy was what influenced the architects to juxtapose two different energies together. With its dynamic and static shapes in tandem, Dancing House is one iconic proof that form can also be pliable and animated.\n\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\nIt may take a few seconds to render, depending on the device.\nworks better with chrome\n\ncreated using WEBGL on p5.js\ndirbots - Feb23",
