            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

Months of aimless wandering have culminated in this series; a meditation on my struggles to find a direction in my life and with my art.\n\nAt times paralyzed by too many possibilities, and at other times completely void of ideas. I was lost in the depths of my thinking, overwhelmed by indecision and doubt.\n\nGenerative works are a form of process art, yet along the way I’d forgotten to “trust the process”. It was time to cede control and let each line of code light the way.\n\n-\n\nThis project paints on a 2D canvas, pixel by pixel. I used a custom projection that blends isometric and perspective techniques, to create an uncanny viewpoint between the two. Objects are randomly generated, then an algorithm applies color mixing and position displacement to each pixel as it’s rendered.\n\nBy default the canvas has 2k pixels on its longest edge. You can change this in live view by pressing any number from 1-9. For example, pressing ‘4’ would render it with 4k pixels along the longest edge. I recommend ‘4’, but this can take up to a few minutes to render.\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the rendered image.",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "\"Garden, Monoliths\" is the result of an algorithm that started in April 2021. It was called \"Grass.js\".\nSpring was blooming all around the house, taking over the stones and remnants of ancient battles that stood here. Inspiration was everywhere.\nThe initial goal was to use mathematical formulas for creating patterns inspired by the density of nature, that could be used by a pen plotter, so it kept focusing on outputting vector lines. This history and practice produced a graphical style based on line strokes, plus occasionally some transparent, filled shapes.\nEach artwork will be either \"Garden\" or \"Monolith\", for they are variations of two existing designs from the workshop.\n\n",

            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

            "description": "This project was started in December 2021. At that time, I didn't know what the result would be. It was only an idea to create something memorable, you know, like a photo that people keep in their wallets, or a picture on someone's office desk, something that evokes warm and nostalgic emotions. I didn't have a specific plan, so I just focused on testing different mechanics that might be useful in my future drop. And then, in February 2022, the war came to my home. For two weeks, my family and I hid from bombs and rockets in the basement of our house, and finally, we were lucky enough to escape. We have been looking for a safe place to stay for months, and with several relocations, depression set in, and it was difficult to believe what was happening. I thought that such events only happened in movies and history textbooks. The only way to distract myself was by coding. And then, during one of our relocations, I realized what should be the main idea of this project. This is what I had watched for hours during every relocation. Whether it was a bus ride or a train ride, only the background changed, but the landscape was almost the same - endless Ukrainian wheat fields. Fields, some of which were occupied, burned, or simply turned into minefields. Fields symbolized by the yellow color on the flag of Ukraine. These are the fields I want to see again but in reverse order, on my way home. \n\nI dedicate this drop to everyone who, for whatever reason, had to leave their home against their will.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[4] to change resolution\n- Press [s] to save\n\nMade with p5js and hope\nCopyright @Kitel87 || 2023\n",

            "description": "At length, I summoned the courage to approach.\n\n-\n\nI was worn. Months of aimless wandering have culminated in this series; a meditation on my struggles to find a direction in my life and with my art.\n\nAt times paralyzed by too many possibilities, and at other times completely void of ideas. I was lost in the depths of my thinking, overwhelmed by indecision and doubt.\n\nGenerative works are a form of process art, yet along the way I’d forgotten to “trust the process”. It was time to cede control and let each line of code light the way.\n\n-\n\nThis project paints on a 2D canvas, pixel by pixel. I used a custom projection that blends isometric and perspective techniques, to create an uncanny viewpoint between the two. Objects are randomly generated, then an algorithm applies color mixing and position displacement to each pixel as it’s rendered.\n\nBy default the canvas has 2k pixels on its longest edge. You can change this in live view by pressing any number from 1-9. For example, pressing ‘4’ would render it with 4k pixels along the longest edge. I recommend ‘4’, but this can take up to a few minutes to render.\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the rendered image.",
