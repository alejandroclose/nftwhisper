            "description": "This project began as an exploration of how human beings across all sorts of cultures respond in remarkably similar ways in terms of associating sounds with shapes.  That’s a project I will have to come back to. Along the way, the outputs started to remind me of landforms seen from high above and topographical maps of imaginary terrain - the terrain of my own being.\n\nThough the work is algorithmic through and through, I have used elements of my analog photographic work as a bits and pieces of some layers.  These photographic works are chemigrams, and are generative in their own right, arising from semi-controlled chemical reactions on dark room paper in the presence of resists and light. These chemigrams are the first topos of my being, and bringing them into this work emphasizes something I have long wanted to pursue - the rich interplay of my analog and digital practices in search of unexplored territory.\n\nExplore some territory - you just might find the quadrangle of your being.\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint free editions to the extent of their reserves on a first come, first served basis.  Beginning in the 2nd week, any unclaimed editions will be offered for public sale. \n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \nSeed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you record the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the recorded seed to retrieve it.\n\nProject Details:\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in July, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.\nPress [S] in live mode to download a high resolution output suitable for framing.\nPress [F] in live mode to toggle the frame on and off.\n",

            "description": "\"Layers of Noise\" is a generative art project, a collaboration between the digitally native artist Rafael Spiff and myself, Bruta currently in my creative-coding, digital abstract-expressionism form. The project focuses on the duality of our existence, typical of Rafael's explorations, while my beloved theme of perseverance and stoicism is emitted in the visual dichotomy of humanoid forms between static/stoic and chaotic elements.\n\nAs a collaborative empath you can see I have drawn from Rafael's visual style, but also I have to admit that another important influence is the pioneer of animated noise algorithms Kim Asendorf.\n\nThe \"Layers of Noise\" system goes beyond the mere complexity of algorithms and focuses on the expressive use of experimentation. It uses the usual suspects - elements of Random and Perlin noise, Clifford based flow fields and some basic Math. These mathematical underpinnings are then creatively shattered using the Canvas API in unprecedented and unconventional ways, resulting in analog-like glitches and captivating deformations.\n\nRafael's exploration of the tension between order and disorder in the human mind finds its perfect counterpart in the generative system's underlying theme of persistence and perseverance. The static humanoid shapes, meticulously crafted by Rafael, symbolize strength and determination, serving as anchors against the infinite layers of noise that pervade the artwork. This juxtaposition evokes a sense of wonder and contemplation, inviting viewers to delve into the intricate depths of the human experience.\n\n\"Layers of Noise\" pushes artistic expression forward, creating a collection of animated artworks that transcend traditional notions of plotting centered generative art into the more digitally native direction of glitch and gif mediums. Each piece is a vibrant manifestation of the human spirit, capturing the beauty, complexity, and resilience inherent in our existence.\n\n\n*In the creation of every output are used three static prerendered assets in the form of .png digital artworks crafted by Rafael Spiff. Every other color, shape, pattern, background animated or not is generated live by the generative system.\n\n*P5.js and Canvas API are mixed in the code.\n\nThe project is implementing fxhash features connected tightly with the visual output, having the craziest outputs being the most rare.\n\nProject is tested and on most popular desktop browsers for Windows.\n\nKeys:\n\n- Click over the screen for a little zoom in into the textures.\n- Press \"s\" for static image download.\n- Press \"g\" to download 3 sec animated .gif.\n- Press \"n\" to Stop/Start animation.\n\n\nThank you!",

Additional patterns are combined in the grid with these distortions to create the final artwork.\n\nPatterns for the individual blocks in the grid are divided into categories, and various amounts are picked for each work, with dozens of possible mixtures. Patterns can flow in different directions across the varied canvases. Distribution of these patterns across the grid varies from work to work, providing for different feels as they bunch together or spread apart.",
