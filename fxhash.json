There are 17 figures that get combined and mixed over three layers. The figures vary in complexity but are generally created with vertical and horizontal lines only. Figures have at least one seed, some even have a seed per path. A seed is an oscillating pixel that can be compared to a square wave oscillator of audio synthesis and is usually followed by a path or a set of paths. The purpose of the paths is to send the pixels along the lines to make the figures visible through movement and to create a reduction to pure animation.\n\n👽 Kim Asendorf",

            "description": "This is a journey through architecture that never existed.\n\nInspired by the grammatical rules behind French sacral architecture of the Middle Ages, this generative tool is meant for creating a collection of 256 plans of fictional buildings. Each plan is a unique variation on semantic relations between architectural elements: from a regular composition resembling existing churches to a dynamic aggregation of vaults, columns and chevets. But always following the same set of rules extracted from multiple examples of gothic cathedrals.\n\nEvery church has its place and time in which it could have been built in an alternative series of historical events.\n\nThis artistic tribute to the research of Stiny and Mitchell about Palladian architecture or Duarte's work about Siza takes the topic of formalizing architectural language onto a lighthearted level by moving it to a slightly imaginary world.\n\nTo zoom, press a mouse button when over the image or touch the screen. To pan, keep the mouse pressed and move it around.",

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

            "description": "There’s so much more to our world than what we are able to perceive, let alone understand. Will we ever be able to even fully understand ourselves?\n\n–\n\nElevation is a series of 320 generative elevation drawings of imaginary structures. It is a reminder of the limits of our consciousness, and an ode to the manifold nuances that lie beyond what we can perceive, beyond what we even can imagine.\n\nAs a generative artist, I aim to elevate my own consciousness with the help of the machine. I welcome algorithms and randomness into the creation of my works, taking full control, and intentionally giving it away, always seeking to expand my imagination. For as humans alone, we remain limited to our own edifice of thought, and often fail to free ourselves from the visible, mundane world.\n\nBoth are present in Elevation: the visible and the imaginary, the mundane and the transcendent, the solid and the fragile. Where an architect’s elevation drawing marks the transition from the thought world into the visible world, Elevation remains in-between, depicting both the idea of an imaginary structure, and the structure itself.\n\n–\n\nElevation is intended for print. All holders of an Elevation NFT will be able to order the corresponding signed print in the respective paper format via andreasrau.eu/elevation. Press [s] to save the image as displayed or [p] to generate a print-ready PNG image at 300 dpi. This might take a while, depending on paper format and your hardware.\n\n–\n\nElevation\np5.js, glsl, html, css\nAndreas Rau, 2022",

Gardens have always been small pieces of paradise for me, and hearing the word in Armenian triggers a flood of warm memories.\n\nMemories of wandering around my grandfather’s garden, plucking ripe plums and figs from their branches.\nMemories of playing in my parents yard, the scent of jasmine in the summer heat.\nOf sun warmed tomatoes in my mom’s vegetable patch.\nThe smell of dirt and grass.\nMud on my hands.\nSun on my skin.\nMemories of paradise.\n\nI hope you enjoy these gardens I’ve planted, and I hope they remind you of some warm and wonderful memories.\n \nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n - This piece uses a shader to compute the lighting of the terrain in the first frame. If you don’t have a graphics card, you may have difficulty running this.\n\n - Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you the progress of the render, and also show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.\n\n - Finally, collectors at the highest tier will be entitled to a signed print of their edition. For further details and updates, keep an eye on my Twitter (@_NatSarkissian).\n",

Each plan is a unique variation on semantic relations between architectural elements: from a regular composition resembling existing churches to a dynamic aggregation of vaults, columns and chevets. But always following the same set of rules extracted from multiple examples of gothic cathedrals.\n\nEvery church has its place and time in which it could have been built in an alternative series of historical events.\n\nThis artistic tribute to the research of Stiny and Mitchell about Palladian architecture or Duarte's work about Siza takes the topic of formalizing architectural language onto a lighthearted level by moving it to a slightly imaginary world.\n\nTo zoom, press a mouse button when over the image or touch the screen.

            "description": "In 1993, Basque sculptor Eduardo Chillida proposed a project to create an immense void inside Tindaya, the Sacred Mountain of Fuerteventura's indigenous inhabitants. The hollow cube measuring approximately 45 x 50 x 65 meters was conceived as a space for \"all the people\" to \"fully experience the tininess of humankind\".\n\nThe idea of the project dates back to the 1980s, and it took the artist years of searching for the ideal mountain in different parts of the world. However, what was ideal for Chillida evoked a lot of controversy due to the environmental and social impact of the project. There was uncertainty about Tindaya's structural feasibility and the potential harm to the ancient petroglyphs engraved on its surface. What's more, the financial sustainability of the project's economic model would depend on hundreds of thousands of tourists visiting the site each year, converting a work of art into a holiday attraction.\n\nChillida called his project the Monument to Tolerance. Although it never came into existence, it has caused division and conflict since it was conceived.\n\n\n\"hollow\" is an exploration of 256 voids in nonexistent natural monuments. Made of digital matter instead of stone and lacking cultural charge, its sole purpose is to contemplate the tininess of humankind.\n\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu. You may choose the quality from preview to the resolution of a print of approximately 30cm in height.

Gardens have always been small pieces of paradise for me, and hearing the word in Armenian triggers a flood of warm memories.\n\nMemories of wandering around my grandfather’s garden, plucking ripe plums and figs from their branches.\nMemories of playing in my parents yard, the scent of jasmine in the summer heat.\nOf sun warmed tomatoes in my mom’s vegetable patch.\nThe smell of dirt and grass.\nMud on my hands.\nSun on my skin.\nMemories of paradise.\n\nI hope you enjoy these gardens I’ve planted, and I hope they remind you of some warm and wonderful memories.\n \nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes:\n - This piece uses a shader to compute the lighting of the terrain in the first frame. If you don’t have a graphics card, you may have difficulty running this.\n\n - Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done. The maximum resolution seems to be limited by what your web browser allows. I have been able to output up to 11140px tall and wide using Firefox, which should be enough detail for prints up to 37x37 inches. I recommend keeping the console open while attempting larger renders. It will show you the progress of the render, and also show you if you have attempted too large a render for your system. N can be any positive whole or decimal number greater than or equal to 1.\n\n - Finally, collectors at the highest tier will be entitled to a signed print of their edition.

            "description": "We look at things that are seemingly random and can't help but form relationships between them. For centuries people of many different nations and cultures have looked up to the skies and perceived patterns, objects, mythical creatures from scattered stars.\n\nThis work, initially titled 'Chaos', began as a study for my project 'Gestalt' to explore the idea of working with a foundation of hidden random points and connecting points with curves in interesting ways. Almost by accident I discovered a technique which ended up creating outputs resembling scenes from some otherworldly cosmos. While it produced some visually interesting outputs, they didn't quite fit the direction for 'Gestalt' and only a portion of the algorithm was used. \n\nThe study was recently revisited and further refined to explore something different to 'Gestalt' (yet would nod to it), blur the lines between abstraction and figuration, and lean into the atmospheric moodiness of that once accidental output. 'Constellations' plays with the concept of interconnectivity, the meeting and interacting of hidden elements, and the emergence of patterns and interpretations from chance encounters (or kismet).\n\n---\n\nReleased for VerticalCrypto Art invites | LONDON 2022.\n\n---\n\nControls:\n• 'R' reassembles the piece\n• 'B' toggles the frame\n\nNote: Some mints may take time to fully render in live mode.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated Oct 2022\nArtist: @Yazid",

            "description": "EDNŌ represents a significant milestone in Iskra's ongoing exploration of minimal expression within her narratives. As a devoted admirer of color, Iskra's foray into 2023 marks a pivotal juncture in her creative journey, one aimed at establishing a robust framework and foundation for her artistic endeavors. While color serves as the conduit for emotion and expression, the frame and body of her work provide the essential principles and statements. Discovering certainty within these foundational elements is a pivotal step in her quest to gain a deeper understanding of the origins of emotion when color bursts onto the scene.\n\nIskra now unveils her latest creation. EDNŌ alludes phonetically to the manner in which \"1\" is pronounced in Bulgarian. Following her earlier exploration, \"ESCAPE,\" encapsulated as exploration number 0, Iskra initiates a culturally nuanced taxonomy that will serve as an overarching framework for future works.\n\nDespite the absence of overt emotions, \"EDNŌ\" is not devoid of narrative depth. It draws strong inspiration from one of cinema's most impactful moments – the ending scene of \"Zabriskie Point”, a 1970 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, known for its surreal and symbolic elements. It explores themes such as youth rebellion, the alienation of modern society, and the search for personal freedom and meaning.\n\nView the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUVM1Pq2VWY&t=130s\n\nThe film's climax features a spectacular explosion of a suburban home, which can be seen as a symbol of the rejection of the establishment and a call for radical change.  The structural composition of this work lies on its simplicity, much akin to the cryptic nature of the cinematic finale it alludes to. Its interpretation, however, unfolds as an open canvas for each observer, fostering a subjective engagement. \n\nIskra employs a methodical arrangement of elements, deploying the interplay between stark blacks and whites to serve as an illuminating agent, accentuating the nuances of individual pixels. This digital chiaroscuro is presented a part of the canvas or sometimes confined inside a container. In both representations the interaction of the user initiates the explosion.\n\nIt is, dear viewer, a contemplative question that remains - once the detonation transpires, would you prefer to find yourself contained within the box or liberated beyond its confines? The answer, an open canvas for interpretation, is yours to discern.\n  \nWhile the whole system alludes exclusively to its monochromatic approach, a few outputs dissipate into wisps of smoke. \n\nThat decision opened the door for a few emotions to hack it. The chill of detachment, represented with blue and green tones, and the warmth of affection, represented by red and pink ones.\n\nFeatures:\n\nSmoke\nEmotion\nCondition\n\nCommands:\n\nEach piece is created to be seen as a static composition. To animate it just press anywhere on the screen or use the spacebar, depending on your device. \n\nStatic view – To save the image:\nYou can save the image by pressing “s”: either as the initial static image or at any moment using the animation. I really encourage you to find the best composition during the animation. All of these frames are yours, so just choose the ones you prefer. One piece basically becomes a set. You will find the number of the frame in the filename if you download it. I would kindly ask you to mention the edition number, as well as the frame number, in case you share or exhibit it.\n\nYou can increase the resolution by pressing a number from 1 to 9: this will set the pixel density to that number, if your graphics card can handle that.\n\nTo save a gif: \n- “g” for the gif by default (a part of the whole animation)\n- “x” to export it at a reasonable size for Twitter (for X now) (a shorter part of the whole animation span)\n- “b” for a 1024px wide gif (full animation)\n- “m” for a 500px wide gif (full animation)\n\nYou can set the piece to display a given frame of the animation via the URL: add this to the end of the URL: &frame=frameNumber\n",

            "description": "The world awakens. Early birds twittering. Some rustling in the leaves. A cloudless sky, a cold night. Tiny condensed water droplets float in the chilly air. Fog hangs over the damp ground of the unfamiliar forest. It obscures the view. What awaits you?\n\nMorning haze has a certain attraction, especially in unfamiliar territory. With a rich imagination, all sorts of things can happen behind the fog. It is a magical phenomenon. The fog can linger, but the first warm rays of sunlight can also dissolve the mist in an instant.\n\nIn this work, the morning mist is symbolic. It represents a new beginning. What lies ahead is still uncertain. Everything is possible, but whatever the day may bring, in the end, just like fog, all things pass. \n\n#Features\n- 9 different colors and one in gray scale;\n- 4 different layouts (positioning of the vegetation);\n- 3 different aspect ratios (1:1, portrait and landscape);\n- in 'live mode', click inside the image to save for print;\n\nThis artwork requires processing power and is intended for laptops and desktops primarily. It may take some time to render. Please give it some. It's always nice to start a foggy morning calmly. On mobile browsers, animations are disabled.\n\nGenerative art coded with p5js.\n\n2022, gpitombo and lucassreveil\n\n#fxcollab\n\n",
