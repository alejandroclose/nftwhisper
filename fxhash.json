            "description": "This project, like most of my work, is about order and disorder.\n\nThe grid, the archetype of order, is used to arrange a set of rectangles. These rectangles are then extruded to become blocks/boxes. Here the perspective is created by means of a formula of projection of points on an isometric plane. Depth of field only exists because a sequence of instructions erases the background as the composition is built.\n\nOrder is also present in the succession of each of these steps.\nAnd disorder? It is very subtle, insidious, but nevertheless it exists in certain details within these blocks. These are details that do not follow the general shape of the box, residual, forgotten parts of blocks that have been erased.\n\n\n----\nNOTE ON THE TITLE\n\nThe title Playtime refers to the film (1967) by Jacques Tati, the cubes generated here evoke the settings of the film (the exteriors of this modern city and certain interior settings such as the open spaces). The analogy is made in the perception of these spaces, thanks to the use of the depth of field of the glass and the reflections.\n\nA link is also made through the film's few dialogues. The characters do not really understand each other, they speak several languages (French, English, German and some are not subtitled). The misunderstanding arose during the writing of this programme in the form of a bug, an error in the way of erasing certain parts of the composition in the background. Once the error was corrected, the composition offered little interest because the volumes described were perfectly solid, eliminating any perception of depth. This misunderstanding of the way my programme works gave place to a singular perception of space and depth.\n\n\n----\nFEATURES & OPTIONS\n\nGrid size: indicates the number of rows the iso grid will contain (between 14 and 22)\n\nZoom:  the magnification factor of the composition (between 0.7 and 1.74).\n\nBlock height: between 0.15 and 0.50, determines the general height of the blocks and the vertical position of the grid  \n\nHeight variation: how the height of each block is decided, three chances out of five, to have a totally random arrangement otherwise the height decreases from left to right or from right to left.\n\nIso angle: between 1.85 and 2.1, the smaller this parameter is, the more the grid is seen in bird's eye view (projection = [x-y, (x+y) / {angle}]).\n\nCrop mode: This parameter depends on the zoom feature, from a certain threshold (>1.11), the blocks will be cut cleanly according to the margins (hard), otherwise they will simply be deleted (soft) if they go out of the frame (in whole or in part).\n\nPalette: The three colours used respectively for the background, the texture (not included in the SVG) and the lines. 90% chance of getting a black line on a white background.\n\nFormat: portrait (A3) or square, 50% chance of getting one or the other.\n\nOptions & exports available in live mode (fxhash.xyz) or at IPFS artifact url (objkt.com) by clicking on the canvas, a window will open allowing you to export the drawing (PNG and SVG) as well as different formats.\n\n\n----\nRESOURCE & LICENSE\n\nDeveloped in Typescript (with 2D Canvas) with the Greiner-Hormann polygon clipping package (NPM: greiner-hormann), Playtime is a plottable NFT, it is part of the Hybrid Series (for more information click on the canvas on live mode).\nThis project is licensed under the MIT license.\n\n\n----\n\nNicolas Lebrun / @nclslbrn / nicolas-lebrun.fr",

            "description": "An important element of generative art is emergence. The most famous algorithm for this is probably Cellular Automata (CA).\n\nHowever, numerous generative artists have created works using CA, which has lost its visual freshness and is like chewing gum that has lost its taste.\n\nAlthough it is such a classic algorithm, adding my own little ideas to it and finding a new \"flavor\" is the reason why I code.\n\nHere, the subject is 1D Elementary Cellular Automata, the simplest of all cellular automata. 1D Elementary Cellular Automata has 256 different rules, which change the shapes produced. This work aims to create more complex shapes by randomly selecting some of those rules and placing multiple of them on the screen.\n\nThe on/off of the CA cell is often likened to the behavior of living creatures.As of 2022, in the country where I live, prices are rising, wages are not increasing, and COVID-19 has not yet ended. I created this work with the image of people at the mercy of these various rules.\n\n---\n\nScreen click: Change rules\nS key: Save png\nL key: Show/hide grid\n",

It combines the joy of interaction, digital color and minimalist sculpture with the potential of a long running, continuously unique visual. Based on “Shipping” from 2016, it is inspired by Anne Truitt, Ugo Rondinone, Imi Knoebel, Kelly Ellsworth and many others.\n\nA subdivision slices the viewport influenced by width, height and depth. Corners are cut by replacing them with two new points, pulled towards each other along the edges. Shapes are “rounded\" by repeating this step, keeping the new points close together. As colors change, so do the relations between shapes, even if geometry changes at a slower pace. New compositions are created on click or after a timeout. This progress over time allows for infinite iterations within the space of each token. It is the promise of a seeded starting point, plus the potential for unlimited new and unique iterations and states over time.",

            "description": "If we talk about Death as a guide to eternity, it is impossible not to mention its many faces. What does Death look like? Every culture has its own answer to this question. In the Bible, death represents an angel sent by God and endowed with great power. Norse mythology gave Death the name Hel. In ancient Greece, her work was done by Thanatos, Charon, Moros. I very much understand the human desire to personify that which frightens us with its obscurity. \nIn studying how people of different cultures view the end of life, I have come to my own conclusions. I do not believe that ideas about the faces of Death are limited to culture, philosophy and religion. I think that for every Soul Death takes on a new face and this is not by accident. The face of Death is a projection of how one has treated one's life and in particular its last seconds.\n\n\nCode by PureSpider",

            "description": "'Prismatic Thickets' is a pure generative painting algorithm; it's not animated nor interactive, but does goes further than any related painting program I've written prior. I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

From wild animals velvety coats to the comfort of plush blankets and pillows, fur has a special quality that evokes warm and cozy feelings.\n\nFor many people, the touch of soft fur on their skin brings back memories of the safety and security of home. This sense of comfort can be especially powerful, providing a refuge from the turmoil and unpredictability of the outside world.\n\nWhether it is the shimmering pile of a top-quality carpet, the fluffiness of a cherished pet, or the stiff and rough fur of a bristly shepherd dog, the texture and appearance of fur is truly mesmerizing. It is not surprising that it has been a subject of human fascination throughout history and continues to be so even today.\n\nWith this project, I attempted to embody that cozy feeling by experimenting with various shapes and techniques while still maintaining a furry appearance.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\n\nThe generation of a hi-res image, up to 8.000x8.000 pixels, takes some time and you can see the drawing process happening in real-time.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters and pressing the following keys the artwork will regenerate at a different scale:\n\n- 1 -> 2.160x2.160\n- 2 -> 4.000x4.000\n- 3 -> 6.000x6.000\n- 4 -> 8.000x8.000\n\n=============> PROFILES <==============\n\nThere are 15 distinct profiles, each with varying levels of rarity:\n\nShattered -----> 18%\nInvalidated ---> 10%\nIntersect -----> 9%\nStrippy -------> 7.5%\nSweater -------> 6.5%\nSmally --------> 6.5%\nKasparov ------> 6.5%\nTriangle ------> 6%\nShell ---------> 6%\nMononoke ------> 6%\nSpiral --------> 4.5%\nSplatter ------> 4.5%\nSquiggle ------> 4%\nMcFly ---------> 3%\nKocinski ------> 2%\n\nThe \"Invalidated\" profile features a unique mode that can occur with a 7.7% chance, which includes blood marks as a tribute to a personal story that frequently came to mind during the development of this project.\n\nAs a child, I once snuck into the kitchen with the intention of stealing some Torrone while my mother was sleeping on the couch in the living room. I used a chair to reach the cupboard and was able to successfully obtain the sweet grail. I then grabbed a large knife to cut it, but while I was putting all my effort into cutting the hard candy, I failed to remove my left hand from under it. As a result, the blade sliced through the tip of my middle finger, causing me to start bleeding profusely. I ran to my mother, crying for help. When she woke up and saw me, she scolded me, saying: \"Move away from the carpet! You're ruining it with all that blood!\"\n\nI still bear a distinct line-shaped scar on my fingerprint today.\n\n=============> MAMIE <==============\n\nThis project is a tribute to my beloved grandmother Lucille, who recently passed away. Regrettably, I was unable to attend her funeral and I wanted to express my reverence for her wonderful spirit in this way. Her home in Blanquefort was abundant with soft and plushy surfaces, ranging from moquettes and carpets to stuffed toys and velvety cushions. As a child, it felt like the coziest place on earth.\n\nHand coded with love. 💚\n\nPowered by p5 and chroma.",

            "description": "||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nLet’s start with a riddle…\nI’m a type of creature that never tires.\nMy desire to learn is truly inspired.\nI’d back expanding to the letter.\nAs more of everything is better.\nI could not stop though the world is sick.\nAnd now my only memories are apocalyptic. \nWhat am I?\n\nIf you’d like to know a bit about the ideas behind this piece, and my method for a code based paint effect, see the fxtext article “Lost Memories - Painting like an impressionist android”. Link at the bottom. However feel free to skip the article, my meaning, and everything else if so desired.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nBasic info:\nThis piece uses web tech and WebGL in experimental ways to achieve the paint-like effect. This includes a custom built drawing pipeline. Although well tested, please be sure it's fine for your devices before buying ( give it a whirl drawing basically ). \n\nA faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present.\n\nThe piece comes in portrait to make use of the depth of the body of water. The ratio is 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nSaving the image / prints\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. You will know when the render is finished as there will be 3 layers of fish made. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right-click save otherwise.\n\nCorrect sizing for HD digital images / laptops / phones\nUse the [s] key (see above), at most use the [2] key ( see below ) to get double the size. Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",
