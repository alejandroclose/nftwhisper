            "description": "“Sparsely Populated Grid” is the result of an architect’s fascination with Cartographies and a crypto-enthusiast love for Neo Punk aesthetics. The first sketch, drawn by hand with Procreate, was made in October 2021.\n\nThis is an exploration on the field of Generative Cartographies, an abstract diagrammatic representation of a randomly generated area within the virtual IPFS world. Everything starts with an GRID of varying sizes and angles, subsequently POPULATED by a random number of forms. But, how to populate the grid? SPARSELY, of course, with just the right amount of superpositions.\n\nThe algorithm produces varying compositions of fourteen different forms, with seven possible mixes and ten colour palettes. Movement, made possible by its generative digital nature, follows sinusoidal patterns, as if the forms breathed and danced to an unheard music.\n\nBesides, they never forget to celebrate birthdays.\n\n\n// INTERACTIVITY\n\n- CLICK or SPACEBAR to stop movement.\n- UP and DOWN ARROWS to Disable/Enable graphic elements such as texts (wink).\n- LEFT and RIGHT ARROWS (when stopped) to Move frames back and forth.\n- Press 1 for a low-res PNG.\n- Press 2 for a medium-res PNG (3x).\n- Press 3 for a hi-res PNG (6x).\n- Press G for Glitch (low-res).\n- Press P for PixelArt (low-res).\n\nIf you want a different resolution, you can also add ?&res=xxx to the url to get your desired output. Then simply Right-Click SAVE the canvas -- experimental",

Look to the far side. You see people were leaving already. But you loved the planet so much that you dare to risk and stay a bit longer before you leave.\n\nThis moment becomes bottomless. Landscapes glitter vividly with altered gradients, fog emits at the far end of the land, and Energy leaks and escapes from the core, thru the cracks in form of aurora structure.\n\nIt is a mix of sadness, grief, missing, and anxiety.\nIt is the end.\nIt is breathtaking.\nIt makes you hesitate.\n\n// About the scene\nThe planet was vast.\nYou may experience Rocky Sierra, Fluidy Mountains, Wide Dunes, and even Calm Ocean.\n\nThe Breakdown\nIn the rare case, you might be able to see a highly pixelated/extreme wide/flat landscape with finely emitted aurora, which is considered a rare scene. i.e. absolute strength of light vs breakdown of limited matters.\n\n// About the presentation style\nThe Texture & The Drawing : Heavily inspired by pencil sketching techniques that emphasize shading and outline relationship towards an angular light source.\n\nApply color scheme from other Astro objects to give an alternative look for the planet.\n\nThe Animation Sequence: Custom storytelling algorithms combine the formation of the aurora, landscape, and scene detail all in a timeline. The resulting sequential narrative style illustrates the history of the landscape and the aurora formation.\n\nNot just giving the collector the final look but also sharing the cause and reason of such composition.\n\nThe Tiny Zoom: A tiny zoom-out movement is implemented in the piece to echo the theme of the piece. i.e. leaving and departing the planet.\n\n// About the Music\nTwo theme songs were made for this piece.\n\nTheme I: [Solitude]\nTheme II: [Fragmented]\n\nBoth songs were made to present the process of departure: the sleep of the planet and the awakening of the observer.\n\n// Metaphor\nWe face departure and arrival all the time. They might be the best or the worst memories of our life. Whether you are willing to or not.\n\nThe ending is an ongoing process and on the other side of the Ending comes the beginning.\n\nIt is ok to be sentimental.\n\n// Control\nBest viewed in large and wide proportion.\n(Open in new window)\n\n[S] - save the scene once the drawing stops\n[L] - leave and take a look at other places\n[Mouse Click] - click twice to initiate music. then click one to mute/show\n\n\n- 與垂死星球的最後一天 -\n\n從感傷開始。\n\n這是你曾經生活在的星球之最後一天，你們的關係將要結束，許多有意義的回憶也將封印成回憶。\n\n看看遠方。其他人已經開始離開了。\n你還留著，想好好看看這個星球。\n\n你請願冒險，也要在離開之前多停留一段時間。\n\n此刻像是無限。景觀隨著漸變的顏色而變得更加生動，在陸地的遠端散發出最後的火霧，能量從核心洩漏，以極光狀的結構從裂縫中逸出。\n\n它是悲傷、內疚、思念和焦慮的混合體。\n這是結束。\n但又嘆為觀止。\n讓你猶豫不決。\n\n// 關於現場\n這個星球曾經很大\n您會經歷到寂靜的岳峰、流動的山脈、寬闊的沙丘以及平靜的海洋。\n\n罕見的一刻 - 物質崩壞\n在極少數情況下，您可能會看到極寬/平坦/鋸齒化的景觀與高像素細膩的極光並存，即光的絕對強度與有限的物質瓦解。\n\n// 關於演示風格\n紋理與繪畫風格 : 深受鉛筆素描技術的啟發，這些技術強調與角光源的陰影和輪廓關係。\n\n應用其他天文物體的配色方案，為地球提供另一種外觀。\n\n動畫序列 : 自定義敘事算法將極光、風景和場景細節的形成全部結合在一個時間軸中。由此產生的順序敘述風格，說明了景觀的歷史和極光的形成。\n\n不僅給收藏家最終的外觀，而且還分享了這種構圖的原因和原因。\n\n小變焦 : 作品中實施了微小的縮小運鏡，以呼應作品的主題 - 離開。\n\n// 關於音樂\n為作品製作了兩首主題曲。\n\n主題一：【獨】\n主題二：【碎】\n\n兩首歌表達/呈現離開的過程：星球的沉睡和觀察者的覺醒。\n\n// 隱喻\n不管你願不願意，我們無時無刻都面臨著離去和到來。離去前它們是我們一生中最美好/最糟糕的回憶。\n\n結局是一維，離開是二維的，另一端叫作開始。\n\n覺得感傷是ok 的。\n\n// 控制\n但在大寬視窗下視覺效果最好\n(Open in new window)\n\n[S] - 繪圖停止後存取畫作\n[L] - 離開去其他地方看看\n[鼠標單擊] - 單擊兩次以啟動音樂。 然後單擊一個靜音/顯示",

It's an animated generative experiment that focuses on finding the simplest and fewest components that - when generated randomly - always create structures resembling buildings: from small modern houses through industrial facilities to gigantic brutalist monuments.\n\nThis resulted in 4 main components: Base, Extension, Gap and Window. These entities are used randomly to create Blocks that form the final structure. \nThe whole process is also strictly accompanied by 4 distinct components to hold colors and to be set by randomly chosen palettes: Sky, Sun, Shadow, Window.\n\nFeatures consist of a mixture of the above components.\n\nThe project is animated to show how the buildings come to life. It's also a nice way to show what's going on in the background, because from time to time a bigger block would surely hide interesting smaller ones :) \n\nPress these keys:\n's' - to download a larger resolution PNG\n'n' - to shuffle through the 'depth' of Blocks, aka placing them from front to back and vice versa. This is a nice feature to show structures hidden by others and also a cool way to create iterations inside the iteration - sub-iterations - we can say :)\n'r' - to reset the Blocks' depths to default\n\nPlease note:\nEverything you see is generated, animated and drawn real-time. No layered transparent PNGs, PFP or similar!\n\nHave fun and inspiration!\n\n\n@cloudnoise © 2022\n\n☁︎\n\nCreated with P5.js library.",

            "description": "Inspired and fascinated by Brutalism, Modernism and Bauhaus, I've started to explore the deeper connections of architecture using pixel art in a clean, minimalistic and unique way.\n\nThe BRUTALIST MOVEMENT project represents the next step in this process. It's an animated generative experiment that focuses on finding the simplest and fewest components that - when generated randomly - always create structures resembling buildings: from small modern houses through industrial facilities to gigantic brutalist monuments.\n\nThis resulted in 4 main components: Base, Extension, Gap and Window. These entities are used randomly to create Blocks that form the final structure. \nThe whole process is also strictly accompanied by 4 distinct components to hold colors and to be set by randomly chosen palettes: Sky, Sun, Shadow, Window.\n\nFeatures consist of a mixture of the above components.\n\nThe project is animated to show how the buildings come to life. It's also a nice way to show what's going on in the background, because from time to time a bigger block would surely hide interesting smaller ones :) \n\nPress these keys:\n's' - to download a larger resolution PNG\n'n' - to shuffle through the 'depth' of Blocks, aka placing them from front to back and vice versa. This is a nice feature to show structures hidden by others and also a cool way to create iterations inside the iteration - sub-iterations - we can say :)\n'r' - to reset the Blocks' depths to default\n\nPlease note:\nEverything you see is generated, animated and drawn real-time. No layered transparent PNGs, PFP or similar!\n\nHave fun and inspiration!\n\n\n@cloudnoise © 2022\n\n☁︎\n\nCreated with P5.js library.",

            "description": "https://www.bfos.art/projects/adherence\n\n======~~~~~~~~~~===================\nWe aren’t all moving in the same direction.  Sometimes we strictly follow the paths we are destined for.  Sometimes we meander in our own way and on our own time.  Let’s explore the ways that these different paths can create beauty.\n=================~~~~~~~===========\n\n\n============Adherence?=============\nThe title feature of Adherence controls how obediently each of the streamers follow their curated path and whether they die off when destined. While each mint will have a default level of adherence, everyone will be able to see what their piece would look like at all other levels of obedience.\n\nYou might prefer to live life conservatively doing everything that is expected of you…but then you’ll be surprised at what joy and beauty can come from a rebellious spirit.\n\n\n============No Restraint============\nThis project is definitely not a lesson in artistic restraint. It has been very exciting for me to grow this project along with my learnings. I’ve spent 6 months building, adding, cutting, and tweaking.  All of this wrestling has left an embarrassingly mangled code base.  That said, I truly believe the diversity of the output-space is worth it.  \n\nDuring development, I encountered some very severe roadblocks, some of which I felt I might never be able to resolve. One in particular, related to ensuring this project is dimensionless, actually brought me to tears once I finally worked through it. Similarly, there were a fair number of major leaps that took just a few minutes from concept to implementation. \n\nMy objective for my next project will be to bring more restraint…for the sake of my sanity if nothing else. It might take me just as long to complete and I expect that it will be a far smaller release, but I’ll still put just as much care into making sure I deliver a quality project for anyone willing to mint.\n\n\n============Open and Ugly============\nI won’t be obscuring my code.  Anyone is free to use browser dev tools to look and learn to their heart’s content.\n\nBe ye forewarned, though.  It’s not pretty.  I started out well enough, but little tweaks here and there to play and expand on the project has resulted in a code base I might be a little embarrassed about.\n\nBut, that’s OK!  We are all in this together and maybe this will be a way of helping others not feel intimidated by a sense of perfection.  I have also included fairly verbose comments, too, as added commentary to my insanity.\n\nI hope that my openness and vulnerability will be seen by everyone in the community as an invitation to connect with me for any reason.  If you'd like to ask me any questions about this project, about my collecting, about learning to code, about working through challenges, or whatever else...please don't hesitate to ping me in just about any of the fx(hash) related discords (Kaloh's, TENDER, fx(hash), clewcrew) or on twitter.  \n\n\n============Interactions============\n{F}eatures\n{P}rogress\n{S}ave at current resolution\n{N}oise Switch\n{1-3} Adjust Adherence\n{4-9} Save at x² resolution\n{I}nfinite Animation Modes - [Experimental] \n\nThere are two infinite animation modes.  I call them experimental because they didn't quite reach the level of polish that I would have preferred.  \n\nThe first mode is a loop-with-reverse.  It runs efficiently, but I think it's a little too obvious what it is doing.  It also messes with the background color.\n\nThe second mode is a more subtle loop that I actually love, but performance is VERY dependent on your device.  My M1 Mac runs it fairly well, but most other devices struggle through frames.  Even at a lower framerate, I think it's a neat effect.  Though, I wish I was able to figure out a way to improve the performance.  I tried a lot of tricks, but none helped that much.\n\n======~~~~~~~~~~==============================~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~==============================\n\n",

The first sketch, drawn by hand with Procreate, was made in October 2021.\n\nThis is an exploration on the field of Generative Cartographies, an abstract diagrammatic representation of a randomly generated area within the virtual IPFS world. Everything starts with an GRID of varying sizes and angles, subsequently POPULATED by a random number of forms. But, how to populate the grid? SPARSELY, of course, with just the right amount of superpositions.\n\nThe algorithm produces varying compositions of fourteen different forms, with seven possible mixes and ten colour palettes. Movement, made possible by its generative digital nature, follows sinusoidal patterns, as if the forms breathed and danced to an unheard music.\n\nBesides, they never forget to celebrate birthdays.\n\n\n// INTERACTIVITY\n\n- CLICK or SPACEBAR to stop movement.\n- UP and DOWN ARROWS to Disable/Enable graphic elements such as texts (wink).\n- LEFT and RIGHT ARROWS (when stopped) to Move frames back and forth.\n- Press 1 for a low-res PNG.\n- Press 2 for a medium-res PNG (3x).\n- Press 3 for a hi-res PNG (6x).\n- Press G for Glitch (low-res).\n- Press P for PixelArt (low-res).\n\nIf you want a different resolution, you can also add ?&res=xxx to the url to get your desired output.

            "description": "Inspired and fascinated by Brutalism, Modernism and Bauhaus, I've started to explore the deeper connections of architecture using pixel art in a clean, minimalistic and unique way.\n\nThe BRUTALIST MOVEMENT project represents the next step in this process. It's an animated generative experiment that focuses on finding the simplest and fewest components that - when generated randomly - always create structures resembling buildings: from small modern houses through industrial facilities to gigantic brutalist monuments.\n\nThis resulted in 4 main components: Base, Extension, Gap and Window. These entities are used randomly to create Blocks that form the final structure. \nThe whole process is also strictly accompanied by 4 distinct components to hold colors and to be set by randomly chosen palettes: Sky, Sun, Shadow, Window.\n\nFeatures consist of a mixture of the above components.\n\nThe project is animated to show how the buildings come to life. It's also a nice way to show what's going on in the background, because from time to time a bigger block would surely hide interesting smaller ones :) \n\nPress these keys:\n's' - to download a larger resolution PNG\n'n' - to shuffle through the 'depth' of Blocks, aka placing them from front to back and vice versa. This is a nice feature to show structures hidden by others and also a cool way to create iterations inside the iteration - sub-iterations - we can say :)\n'r' - to reset the Blocks' depths to default\n\nPlease note:\nEverything you see is generated, animated and drawn real-time. No layered transparent PNGs, PFP or similar!\n\nHave fun and inspiration!\n\n\n@cloudnoise © 2022\n\n☁︎\n\nCreated with P5.js library.",
