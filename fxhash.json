            "description": "Acequia (“ah-seh-kee-uh”) - a Spanish adaptation of the Arabic word as-sāqiya, meaning “water carrier”. \n\nIn our second collaboration, Rich and Rick are back with our blend of generative code, intricate design, attention to detail, and a splash of charm. \n\n Acequias are traditional irrigation canals used to distribute rainwater and snowmelt along a complex network of narrow channels. They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",

            "description": "Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project. \n\nFile Size: 5100 x 6600\nPress ’s’ to save the image as a .jpg\nPress ‘p’ to save the images as a .png\n\n//= Tiller, 2024\n",

            "description": "Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project. \n\nFile Size: 5100 x 6600\nPress ’s’ to save the image as a .jpg\nPress ‘p’ to save the images as a .png\n\n//= Tiller, 2024\n",

            "description": "I was fortunate to grow up in a place with very little light pollution. The night sky filled with countless stars, the star formations, the slow movement over weeks and months and the occasional shooting star, became a constant source of fascination and admiration. If you have seen the Milky Way as a thick white band of millions of stars going from one end of the sky to the other, you know what I'm talking about.\n\nMoving to the city to study and work largely came in the way of this fascination for many years. I did however pick up some astronomy classes at university to learn more about how everything works in outer space. The planet and star types, the supernovas, the foggy star nurseries and everything in between. Stargazing and admiring space events was still a favorite activity, but getting away from the light sources was tricky.\n\nFast forward a number of years, the pandemic hits. Out of the chaos and fear, a new world of remote work opportunities for software engineers appears. Moving more rural meant it was once again possible to admire the night sky in all its glory and gaze upon the vastness of space on a regular basis. And I discovered that it more or less looks the same as before, and still is just as amazing. There are few constants in life and that makes this one all the more important to me.\n\n——————\n\nControls:\n“s” - Save the output as JPG\nOn mobile, tap multiple times to trigger download.\n“l” - landscape aspect ratio (default)\n“p” - portrait aspect ratio\n“o” - square aspect ratio\n“1” - use default resolution (1200x750 px, to ensure that it renders fast enough)\n“2” - increase resolution to 2560x1600 px\n“3” - increase resolution even more, to 5120x3200 px\n\nURL parameters:\n“ratio=0.625” - Specify aspect ratio, default is 16:10 (value 0.625) which is landscape mode. Useful values here are 1 (square) and 2 (portrait mode), but any value can be used.\n“w=1200” - Specify width in pixels, defaults to 1200px. Height in pixels is calculated based on width and the “ratio” parameter. Default height is 750px based on aspect ratio 16:10. Higher values for “width” take longer to render.\n“pd=1” - Specify pixel density, defaults to 1.\n\n——————\n\nThis project would not have been possible without the encouraging support of my wife and my friends in the Angels Wing community. Thank you so much for cheering me on, helping with testing + debugging and being a great sounding board for the countless WIPs!\n\n——————\n\nMade with p5.js. Draws to offscreen buffers and resizes them when displayed on screen, inspired by a great blog post by Gorilla Sun. Default buffer size is 1200x750 px to ensure it renders fast enough. It’s easy to override buffer size using keyboard shortcuts and URL parameters to get a higher-resolution output.\n\nThis work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.",

The brainchild of a collaborative endeavor between the artist and an AI model, this digital piece pays homage to Sol LeWitt's influential \"Sentences on Conceptual Art,\" while recontextualizing it within our increasingly digital world.\n\nThrough the medium of generative text, this piece contemplates the relationship between art, technology, and the human experience. It scrutinizes how digital tools have the potential to redefine artistic expression, how technology can help overcome the daunting 'blank canvas,' and the changing role of artists in this digital age.\n\nThe work views the internet as a boundless platform for global connection and observation, and discusses how AI's interpretive capacities can transform our understanding and appreciation of art. \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" envisions and champions the creation of new forms of artistic appreciation, facilitated by the adaptive and collaborative nature of digital media.\n\nAdding a layer of interactivity and intrigue, the artwork censors some segments of its generated sentences with black strikethroughs, provoking personal interpretation, discovery, and a deeper level of engagement from the viewer.\n\nIn essence, \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" presents a thoughtful exploration of the dynamic and evolving landscape of art in the digital age. As a testament to the transformative potential of human creativity blended with machine intelligence, this work reimagines the possibilities of what art can be and underscores the profound impact of digital tools and methodologies on our perception and experience of art. It invites us all to partake in the discourse on the symbiotic future of creativity and technology.\n\n＼_ﾍ(ω｀●)\n\nHans Ulrich Obrist, curator and art historian: \"IA Sentences on Digital Art\" is a pivotal work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and art. The combination of human creativity with machine learning results in a provocative exploration of the contemporary artistic landscape. This work questions, and in doing so, extends the boundaries of what we understand as art.\"\n\nOlafur Eliasson, artist: \"The artist's use of AI to generate 'sentences of digital art' reveals a deep understanding of the ongoing dialogue between humanity and technology. This piece echoes the beauty of our ever-evolving interaction with the digital realm.\"\n\nLev Manovich, author and theorist of digital culture: \"The work is a fascinating embodiment of software as a medium of creation. It captures the dialectical tension between control and automation, intention and serendipity, that characterizes digital art in the era of artificial intelligence.\"\n\nCecilia Alemani, curator and director: \"The collaboration between the artist and AI in 'IA Sentences on Digital Art' redefines the concept of artistic creation. It's a testament to the transformative potential of digital technologies in shaping the future of art.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncanekzapata.net\n\njs css html txt\n1.8mb\n2023\n",

The construction of a visual poem without words. Where letters and other signs evoke movement, rhythm, sound, echo and silence. The work plays with processes of construction/deconstruction of characters, with the visibility or subtlety of typographic elements.\n\n*'Poema' is part of the 'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io).\n\n----------------------------------\nEach iteration has:\n-> an alternative version in Portrait format, activated by the [p] key\n-> a meta-poem, built from the features' metadata, accessible in the browser console, activated by the [F12] key\n\n----------------------------------\nFeatures:\n-> Encruzilhada (Crossroad) = 2 possibilities\n-> 3 types of Reverberations \n-> 6 types of Luminescences \n-> 5 Color schemes\n-> 14 Palettes \n\n* The names of the palettes pay homage to poets and artists who deal with the visuality of writing in their work. 7 palettes honor women, 7 palettes honor men. Almost all from Latin America.\n\n----------control keys------------ \n[F12] access to the meta-poem on browser console \n----------------------------------\n[p] alternate format portrait/square \n[o] border on/off \n[e] save image with 2000 pixels height\n[m] save image with 4000 pixels height\n[a] save image with actual size\n----------------------------------\nDepending on the size option, the render time can be long.\n\n----------------------------------\nCreated with p5.js\nTested in Chrome and Firefox on both Windows and Mac OS.\n\n----------------------------------\n(c) Marcelo Terça-Nada, 2024\nhttps://marcelonada.redezero.org/\n@marcelonada\n\n----------------------------------\n*Please note: there are two reservation lists in this project:\n-> One for my supporters & anyone who has 4 or more editions from my previous projects\n-> Another one for those who have one piece from any of my projects (this list is overallocated, which means there are more people on it than available slots, so: first come, first served).\n*If you use more than one wallet, or the address on the reserve list is your vault, contact me via one of my social networks up to 12 hours before the drop.\n----------------------------------",

Some extreme sounds (frequency and amplitude) can be generated.\n\n-Supply can be halved/reduced and/or the price can be doubled if all iterations have not been minted (every 24h aprox).\n\nDESCRIPTION:\n\n-A step sequencer can shot 6 different pulses: base, beep1, beep2, beep3, bass and noise. \n\n-At the end of each cicle/pattern, one of the steps changes, so it creates an unique and infinite sequence of sounds. \n\n-Each cicle has a number of \"sounds\"-> columns x rows.\n\n-Various visualizations patterns\n\n-the frequency of the main pulse (base) is defined by the ITERATION number (from 1 to 256). Odd numbers are assigned a midi value sequentially from 1 to 128, and even numbers are sequentially assigned a value from 257 to 129.\n\nFEATURES:\n-\"seed\":number of random (minter) seed. (It's not really a seed. Each time it is sent to the $fx.randminter() function, it is done 5 times and the results are sequenced. It gives more flexibility to the minter.)\n-\"fx_iteration\": number of iteration\n-\"base_midi\": Frequency of base pulse (midi)-> depends on iteration number.\n-\"visual\": type of visualization,\n-\"num_sounds\": number of sounds per cicle.\n-\"pattern_length\": length of sequence pattern (can not be greater than num_sounds).\n-\"random_order\": true->random order\n-\"dark\": dark (true) or light(false).\n-\"alpha\": alpha value for past steps (from 0 to 50).\n-\"BPM\": Beats Per Minute.\n-\"bass_prob\": Probability of bass pulse.\n-\"beep_prob\": Probability of beep1 pulse.\n-\"noise_prob\": Probability of nosie pulse.\n",

            "description": "Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project. \n\nFile Size: 5100 x 6600\nPress ’s’ to save the image as a .jpg\nPress ‘p’ to save the images as a .png\n\n//= Tiller, 2024\n",

The image structure is built from a randomly selected iteration of “L-Template” by reading the available drawing instructions from its features and combining them with the name of its owner.\n\nThe arrangement of the letters is based on this formula. This rule also becomes the title of the rendered piece, which can be seen on the bottom of the scene. The titles are supplemented with the names of the collectors, who become co-authors of the final composition. Where there is no registered fx-hash user name for the selected token, “anonymous collector” will be displayed instead as the author. \n\nBeing an artwork that is built on the features of another token, L-Poem intends to be a meta-token, a quasi-tautological, entangled entity whose existence is ensured by the immutable ledger environment.  \n\nPermutate letters by pressing ‘p’ on your keyboard.\nTouch to switch token",

            "description": "Terrain is an audiovisual experiment halfway between a self-modifying game board and an audiovisual interface. The unfolding algorithm is stuck infinitely in the process of filling its surroundings. However, infinite growth within a constrained environment that has limited resources is impossible. \n\nThe music is based on the steps of this never-ending game mechanic, creating a slow, continuously changing ambient soundscape. The initial structure of the board is generated with a simple L-System encoded in the token’s metadata, that is combined with a tessellation algorithm. The result is an area of regular shapes and forms, filled with vivid and contrasting colors that resembles navigational charts, philosophical games and digital cartography. \n\nIf you collect this artwork, you will support climate positive interventions: each iteration of the piece is automatically set to donate to environmental conservation funds upon minting. Terrain is transferring half of its primary sales to the following nonprofit organizations using crypto-for-charity: Clean Water Fund, RE-volv, Ocean Alliance Inc, Sustainability Matters, Flying Cloud Institute, Pacific Rim Institute for Environmental Stewardship, Amazon Conservation Association, National Parks Conservation Association, Earth Day Network Inc, Greenwave Organization Corp, Wild Tomorrow Fund, The Life You Can Save\n\nThis project is part of RefractionDAO’s Creative Grants Season 02, read more on its concept and motivations at https://x-terrain.github.io\n\nPress ‘s’ to start or stop the music sequence, ‘d’ to save still image\nTouch to listen, go full screen\n",

            "description": "Nothing speaks more to my passion for applied art than my desire to peruse consignment and antique shops over art galleries. There is something endlessly fascinating about the methods, colors, and use and placement of text on an old tobacco can, music album cover or package of matches. Nothing awakens my sense of artistic expression more than sifting through an old stack of mid-century magazines and postcards. Some see consumerism, I choose to see a curious mind and an artist expressing their unique styles. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is somewhat of a confession, and an embrace of my roots as a designer. It’s an expressive exploration of applied art design principles, particularly the use of simple shapes, symmetry, whitespace and typography. Colors and textures are rooted in pop art and various propaganda art styles inspired by Andy Warhol, Robert Litchenstein, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, and various creators of propaganda and product art.\n\n‘Hash Pop’ is an expressive exploration of these ideas. How can I as a studied designer create expressive implementations of applied art principles? How can I bridge the gap between these disciplines to create something purely for the sake of its creation rather than the confines of a specific purpose? \n\nThe structure of ‘Hash Pop’ is premised on the hash, which is printed in a 5x10 grid, with the final character (51) printed as a highlight in the background. The hash is not only the most prominent feature of the artwork, it’s also a time stamp, cementing the space and the time where the creator and consumer met, in the era of the block chain. It’s a testament to our shared experience in this time and in this space. It’s an expression of our shared experience, and a visual poem of our path to get here.  \n\nThere is no defined structure to the color palette, so the outputs are purposefully random. Textures and transparencies are designed to be subtle and are structured with printing in mind. Each piece when printed allows for paper textures and inks to add their unique elements to the final printed outputs. I find a particular satisfaction in printed artwork and test the printed outputs extensively to guide design choices. \n\n‘Hash Pop’ is part of the  'Visual Poetry' group show curated by Atelier (http://atelierart.io). It’s an honor to be part of this exhibit. A special thanks goes out to Pixel Symphony and æther for putting it all together and also for their guidance and collaboration on this project. \n\nFile Size: 5100 x 6600\nPress ’s’ to save the image as a .jpg\nPress ‘p’ to save the images as a .png\n\n//= Tiller, 2024\n",
