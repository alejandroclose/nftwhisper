            "description": "# Los Osos 2422\n\nI was working on the next EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "The concept of organic, obtained from living systems, is said to be an effect that, like a plant and a living being, has grown in a completely dynamic manner in different degrees, and no factor except vital forces has prevented its growth. Organic creation is an example of this type. Léonard de Vinci believed in nature; he wrote, \"Painting is a child of nature\" in his opinion, art should be compatible with nature. His public image of creativity was \"innovation while maintaining fidelity\" to nature. According to Michelangelo, the form the artist gives to the materials is in the artist's mind and the materials themselves. Therefore, the artist is always in a metaphysical struggle with the form and secrets of nature. This is a revelatory process through which the artist discovers the mass of paper already hidden in his mind and the materials. As an architect, I tried to create this work while paying attention to the structuralism of shapes and forms in creation, inspired by the colors in nature and my experience in painting and illustration.\n\nTo spread the vibe of my beautiful community, minters will own 50% of royalty on each secondary sale.\nEighteen different color palettes and three different borders are used in this artwork.\nMade in p5js\nCreated August 2022\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

Mixing etching, silk-screening, offset, photocopy, risography, drawing and painting to design and craft experimental art books.From the day digital, which had always fascinated me, took over my publishing practice, I always liked to create bridges between these two worlds.\n\nThe Living Books is part of this series of hybrid and experimental works where paper and digital resonate.\n\nThis issue #1 is made of 64 pages that will be minted by collectors. A book will eventually be printed and the pages will follow the mint order. Each page exists in a cover version (c) and a xerox version (x).\n\nControls :\n\n• Click to dive into each frame.\n• Press C to toggle cover mode.\n• Press X to toggle xerox mode.\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nThe Living Book #1 by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n",

It represents the generative processes driving fxhash tokens. Generative Tokens are fed with a unique hash to produce unique outputs based on the hash — they are functions with a hash as single input.\n\nThe growth that comes out of the text is driven by a \"Dividing-Aggregating Walkers\" (DAW) algorithm. The hash drives all the DAW settings, as well as a mutation factor which is responsible for changes in each Walker parameters as they divide.\n\nSome iterations will produce very simple outputs whereas others might be more chaotic.\n\nPiece by @ciphrd for fxhash",
