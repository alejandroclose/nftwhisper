            "description": "“Take Wing” is a generative art collection depicting the hope, optimism, and thrilling excitement of a person taking off, gaining traction, and soaring to new heights and off into the great unknown.  \n\nThe algorithm behind the piece stems from an attempt to go back to art fundamentals and codify composition rules and painterly techniques into a generative form - taking into account focal points, contrast, eye movement, and color theory while still giving the algorithm freedom to explore random color palettes, random flow field movement, random brush strokes, and many other degrees of freedom.\n\nThe collection is made in pure code with p5.js and a few GLSL fragment shaders.\n\nThe piece has been created to be exhibited at \"In Touch\" with VerticalCryptoArt in Berlin in September 2022, curated by Anika Meier.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nTo get a (somewhat) high-resolution output, open the live view of your token, and then edit the URL adding &h=5400 at the end of it.  5400 is the tallest you can go, but you can also put a smaller number if you desire.  Be aware that this will only work on a machine with a very beefy GPU, and even then may take a bit, so please be patient!",

And while we devise systems for solving unfathomably complex problems, generating algorithmic creativity, and unlocking regenerative biological possibilities, we simultaneously cling to the power and originality of emotional feeling – believing it to be the irreplaceable source of what makes us human.\n\nIf the body is our shell for emotion and soul, can an artificial humanoid be another vessel for these thoughts and feelings – for human essence itself? If our ‘soul’ is the last stand between us and the machines, what happens when the soul becomes transferable? That we may see answers to these questions looks more real every year, and is perhaps a little frightening. \n\nEmotional Shell uses introspective portraits of future selves to question what it means to be human, when the people around us are no longer human.\n\n---------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 1-3 to select from low, medium, and high quality settings\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2400px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\nFor third party license information, please see bundle.js.LICENSE.txt\n\n---------\n\nTENDER x wwatkns\nAugust 2022",

            "description": "# Los Osos 2422\n\nI was working on the next EmProps release when accidentally I opened a link to a bear utopic civilization through their existing metaverse. Or should I say \"metabears\"?\n\nEnter Los Osos 2422. \n\nFour hundred years into the future bears live in a peaceful civilization heavily inspired by the generative art movement of our times. They are organized in districts that are sustained by bamboo, salmon, berries, and art! Los Osos are black, grizzly, panda, and polar, yet there are no distinctions between species; it's not like they were humans. \n\nThey have different occupations but frequently bears change jobs giving birth to the most eclectic looks.\n\nI took my sketchbook out to capture what I could and started drawing but my presence pissed them off. Ninjas, luchadores, and even a cybearpunk forced me to escape.  Is that a live gummy bear or am I just hungry? The story will continue...\n\n-- \n\nLos Osos 2422 is a PFP art piece composed of 320 hand-made drawings made as an homage to the nascent generative art current fueled by Tezos blockchain technology in 2022. It features hundreds of references to artists and pieces in several generative and non-generative fields.\n\nThe project combines the assets together using a custom open-source algorithm that allows them to stack with the positioning in front and behind the character to create possibilities like shirt collars or hats, dynamic tinting to have hoodies or glasses with different colors, exceptions to give them laser eyes or a green apple in front of the face, complex set-ups to have different versions for some of the outfits, and chance control to allow precise control over the features.\n\n--\n\nPress 'S' on the keyboard to save it as an 1800 x 1800 pixels PNG.",

            "description": "Inland Emotions\n\nOver the centuries, ancient philosophers and modern psychologists have come to the same basic conclusion. The fact is that, according to a few millennia of research, there are a limited number of distinct human emotions, predefined by the human psyche. Sometimes it may seem like we are experiencing a \"new\" one, but on closer inspection, we see that it is the known emotions that are superimposed. Emotions are what they are, and they exist in the same way in each of us, whether we recognize them for what they are or not. But as our history blends into a new emerging state of the world, a whole new range of emotional responses are triggered within us. An infinite maelstrom of variations generated from a simple combination of a few emotions.\n\n\nControls :\n\n• Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to make a capture and download a PNG with a resolution of x1, x2, x3 or x4.\n\n———————\n\nInland Emotions by Ferdinand Dervieux, 2022\nMade with Unity\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0",

            "description": "Redols is a piece about the automated arrangement of geometrical shapes in space and how the images generated can foster different moods. It visually investigates how to adjust the amount of randomness and repetition -both in the code loops and in the visual composition- to create structures that contain the mere essence of geometry and of movement.\n\nIt explores the repetitive use of a simple geometric shape: the circle. Adds some counterpoints to enhance it: squares, lines, and triangles which are found in the background. It focuses on circular shapes, not always drawing exactly. They change their core, their measure, the color, the gradient, or some subtle details. The arrangement uses an elliptical distribution and replicates some shapes to promote the visual recognition of bigger parts thus enhancing the movement feeling.\n\nRedols is my genesis piece at fxhash curated by VerticalCrypto Art and Anika Meier.\nExhibited at IN TOUCH: art in the age of post-nftism show at Dekabinett, Berlin, september 2022.\n\nRedols means circular shapes, not perfect ones, in Catalan and is an investigation of how deterministic processes and algorithms can create appealing arrangements that foster non machinic agencies and sentiments.\n\nThe piece is created by code, coding it from scratch, mixing, and mastering basic drawing techniques. This approach pays attention to the art piece getting old -I hope well- and makes it easier to show and view it on different computers and platforms to prevent its obsolescence.\n\nI tested on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Mac OS, Ubuntu, Android, and iPhone in vertical and horizontal mode, but please check it works on your device before minting.\n\n----\npossible features:\n- colors:  super fosc marro, super blau, taronja-marro, taronja-blau, marro-taronja, marro-blau, blau-taronja, blau-marro.\n- fons: quadradets, escaires, diagonals.\n- fonsple: true, false.\n- redols: equilibrat, mironia, migmig, degradats, vespa, mandarina, us, os, pla.\n- fons2diagonals: true, false.\n\nAnna Carreras 2022",

            "description": "'Part:Counterpart' is an experiment in form, disintegration, and context. Each work is created within one of three modes, Part, Counterpart, or Part:Counterpart.\n\nIn experimenting, I've enjoyed taking a simple composition and breaking it down with various methods. This transforms the original composition into something new, but it also begins to lose what the original had to say. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I want to dive a little deeper and explore ideas as a sort of tangible substance. Already we're comparing ideas against their translations and evolutions, but what happens if we present them both within the context of the other?\n\nAdditionally, what if we present both of these ideas with echoes and tangents, discussion around the ideas and their practical applications instead of imagined? Sure, these aren't our idea, or even our translation, but they exist only because the originals do.\n\nHow does this change our opinion of the original? Is every idea destined to be picked apart and reimagined forever until it bears only a faint resemblance? Where is the line between our Counterpart and an echo?\n\nThis piece hopes to inspire contemplation on the nature of storytelling and artistic inspiration.\n\n10% of ideas are encrypted to obscure the original Part.\nPress ’s’ to save a 3600x4500 png.\nPress ‘p’ to save the original Part, pure and untouched.",

            "description": "Take your entire life, full as it is with the vastness of your lived experiences – and shape it into your cupped hands. Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM. Testing was performed across browsers and devices, but please make sure it works on your device before minting. Note that there are minor colour-intensity differences between different browsers.\n",
