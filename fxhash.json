According to the Law of Conservation of Matter, the total amount of matter in a closed system stays constant over time, only changing its form. Some living creatures have been luckier than others, as we can still find remnants of organisms from millions of years ago, serving as silent witnesses to mankind’s flourishing.\n\nYet, the human race is exploiting the planet at an unprecedented pace. We are depleting its resources, polluting its atmosphere, producing hazardous materials, disrupting the natural balance of all things. We are causing harm while still expecting the earth to nurture and delight us. We’re just a small dot on the timeline, and yet so much damage has been done.\n\nThrough this project, I humbly attempt to create imitations of fossils and other forms of natural matter. These made up forms may appear attractive, reminding us of nature, but what emotion would they evoke in a natureless world, built of concrete, iron, and plastic?\n\nWhat do we leave behind?\n\n\n___\n20% of the primary sales go directly to One Earth, non-profit organization working to counteract the climate crisis in multiple, innovative ways.\n\n___\nTechnical notes:\n\n- By default, an output image size is based on your browser size (x1.25, with a maximum of 1800) - The script is quite heavy, so it may take some time on higher resolutions (but it’s worth it)\n\nDesktop controls:\n- To change the output resolution, use [1..6] on your keyboard (1250..7200px, roughly A5..A0 print sizes on 300dpi) or [0] to restore the default \n- Press [S] to save the current image\n- Press [F] to switch fullscreen mode\n\nMobile controls:\n- Hold two fingers for 2s to save\n- Tap twice to switch fullscreen mode\n\nURL params\n- Add `&density=[number]` (0.5..1) to change calculated field’s density (default is 0.65)\n- Add `&size=[number]` (1..6) to render with desired resolution \n- Add `&save=1` to save image when ready\n\n___\nDeveloped in Javascript, using p5.js (2D Canvas) and chroma.js.\nLicense: CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n© February 2023, MadeUpLifeforms (mulf)\n",

            "description": "\"Somewhere in Between\" is part of the interactive minting experience at Proof of X with KUMALEON, Tokyo, 2023 - Blockchain as a new Medium for Art held at The Face in Daikanyama.\n\nSomewhere in Between is a token that plays with geometry and color - reusing a previous algorithmic strategy for creating irregular grids, the main topic this time was splitting up rectangular regions in various manners. Each rectangle has a number of sockets distributed evenly along it's edges, these sockets can then be connected at random, without intersecting each other. Based on these connections we can then identify different polygonal regions with a contour walking approach. The rectangles are then split into these polygonal regions. That is the essence of this generative piece.\n\nThe Parameters:\n1. This token is tied to the minter address - WYSIWYG - randomness is therefore derived off of that address. This first slider adds an offset to the initial seed, to allow you to explore a couple of variations.\n2. The overall color scheme applied to the rectangular regions.\n3. The background color - each scheme has a different set of background colors.\n4. The overall scale of the grid - a larger grid will be more cluttered and hold more rectangles, a smaller one will be more spacious.\n5. The overall slant of the hachure lines - there's three different modes: random, vertical and slanted.\n\nOther Instructions:\nAdd '&rez=[an integer]' to the url to obtain a higher resolution. 3-4 work best, higher pixel densities will take longer to compute.

            "description": "\"初夏の旅路 Traveling in Early Summer\"\nis part of the interactive minting experience at Proof of X with KUMALEON, Tokyo, 2023.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nConcept:\n\nAs the rainy days came to an end, the gentle fall of cherry blossoms marked the arrival of early summer. This transitional phase between spring and summer brings a mild and pleasant climate. Nature awakens, showcasing vibrant shades of green as plants thrive and flourish. A stroll through the streets of Tokyo reveals a captivating sight: hydrangeas of various colors grace every corner, casting a spell of natural beauty. While the occasional typhoon may pass by, it does not overshadow the charm of this season. Moreover, the ripening plums offer a taste of traditional Japanese flavors, with options ranging from sour plums to plum wine.\n\nMy inspiration for this piece draws upon my own impressions of early summer in Japan. In 2019, having recently arrived in Japan, I embarked on a journey to Kamakura with my friends. The vivid hydrangeas and serene ponds at Hasedera Temple left an indelible mark on my memory as my first encounter with the essence of early summer in Japan. It was during that year that I delved into the realm of creative coding, by using Processing. The following year, in 2020, I ventured further into generative art using P5.js. Both my pursuit of knowledge in Japan and my creative endeavors became integral parts of my life's journey, akin to cherished scenic spots that leave a lasting impression. Through my artwork, I aspire to share my sentiments from this transformative voyage with the audience.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nNow, let's delve into the details of my creation. The objective of this artwork was to portray a top-down perspective of a pond encircled by lush vegetation, reminiscent of a landscape painting. To imbue the work with different atmospheres, I incorporated four distinct styles for the plant elements: grass, leaves, pine needles, and bubbles. The interplay of these elements breathes life into the still scene, infusing the entire artwork with vitality. The rippling water and gracefully swimming koi in the pond evoke a sense of movement, juxtaposing the serene setting. In Eastern culture, koi symbolizes wealth, auspiciousness, health, and happiness. It bestows good fortune upon those who encounter it. Ultimately, my artwork encapsulates my initial impression of early summer in Japan through a creative approach that intertwines reality and imagination, merging motion and stillness.\n\nThrough this artistic endeavor, I aim to transport the audience to the captivating realm of early summer in Japan. With its vibrant colors, gentle breezes, and the promise of new beginnings, this season captures the essence of natural beauty and the richness of Japanese culture. May my work resonate with viewers, allowing them to embark on their own journey through the enchanting landscapes of their imagination.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nSave as a Picture:\n\nPress “s”or “S” to download a PNG copy of the artwork.\n",

            "description": "\"初夏の旅路 Traveling in Early Summer\"\nis part of the interactive minting experience at Proof of X with KUMALEON, Tokyo, 2023.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nConcept:\n\nAs the rainy days came to an end, the gentle fall of cherry blossoms marked the arrival of early summer. This transitional phase between spring and summer brings a mild and pleasant climate. Nature awakens, showcasing vibrant shades of green as plants thrive and flourish. A stroll through the streets of Tokyo reveals a captivating sight: hydrangeas of various colors grace every corner, casting a spell of natural beauty. While the occasional typhoon may pass by, it does not overshadow the charm of this season. Moreover, the ripening plums offer a taste of traditional Japanese flavors, with options ranging from sour plums to plum wine.\n\nMy inspiration for this piece draws upon my own impressions of early summer in Japan. In 2019, having recently arrived in Japan, I embarked on a journey to Kamakura with my friends. The vivid hydrangeas and serene ponds at Hasedera Temple left an indelible mark on my memory as my first encounter with the essence of early summer in Japan. It was during that year that I delved into the realm of creative coding, by using Processing. The following year, in 2020, I ventured further into generative art using P5.js. Both my pursuit of knowledge in Japan and my creative endeavors became integral parts of my life's journey, akin to cherished scenic spots that leave a lasting impression. Through my artwork, I aspire to share my sentiments from this transformative voyage with the audience.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nNow, let's delve into the details of my creation. The objective of this artwork was to portray a top-down perspective of a pond encircled by lush vegetation, reminiscent of a landscape painting. To imbue the work with different atmospheres, I incorporated four distinct styles for the plant elements: grass, leaves, pine needles, and bubbles. The interplay of these elements breathes life into the still scene, infusing the entire artwork with vitality. The rippling water and gracefully swimming koi in the pond evoke a sense of movement, juxtaposing the serene setting. In Eastern culture, koi symbolizes wealth, auspiciousness, health, and happiness. It bestows good fortune upon those who encounter it. Ultimately, my artwork encapsulates my initial impression of early summer in Japan through a creative approach that intertwines reality and imagination, merging motion and stillness.\n\nThrough this artistic endeavor, I aim to transport the audience to the captivating realm of early summer in Japan. With its vibrant colors, gentle breezes, and the promise of new beginnings, this season captures the essence of natural beauty and the richness of Japanese culture. May my work resonate with viewers, allowing them to embark on their own journey through the enchanting landscapes of their imagination.\n\n----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----・----\n\nSave as a Picture:\n\nPress “s”or “S” to download a PNG copy of the artwork.\n",

            "description": "Inspired by the work of Georg Nees, this project uses various rules to connect vertices to lines, building many chaotic shapes. By constraining these shapes into a grid, we can achieve a regularly chaotic artwork. And by reintroducing a bit of randomness in the size of the cells of the grid, we end up with an irregularly chaotic work.\n\nFrom this mixture of regularity and chaos, of lines and vertices, arise multiple questions about the many possible paths that everyone can take at any given time when faced with a decision. Whether we take the simplest or the most twisted path, whether we free ourselves from the limits or whether we stay within the imposed bounds, whether we take the most obvious path or whether we look for the most astute one, in the end, we too often have the impression of going around in circles...\n\nAs always, it's complicated!\n\n---\n\nYou can downloads various SVG versions of this artwork :\n\n1/ open artwork in live view\n\n2/ Press 0 to 4 to get a plottable SVG :\n\n- 0 for a printable SVG, which use alpha transparency for filling (default mode)\n- 1 for 0.1mm pen tip plottable SVG\n- 2 for 0.3mm pen tip plottable SVG\n- 3 for 0.5mm pen tip plottable SVG\n- 4 for 1mm pen tip plottable SVG\n\n3/ If you are asking for a plottable SVG, you can press C to get separate hatching colors for each alpha transparency filling color, which allow you in Saxi to use different pen colors for hatching. Press C again to cancel this mode.\n\n4/ Lastly, press S to download the SVG (matching your previously selected style)\n\nIf you need a confirmation of the SVG settings you selected, double click on the artwork.\n\n---\n\nCoded with care, and with the help of p5.js and p5.js-svg libraries.\nConsider any bug that you could get in your edition as a blessing from the RNG Gods !",

The UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity beautifully states, “As a source of exchange, innovation and creativity, cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature.”  Who better to usher in an age of true appreciation for, and active promotion of cultural diversity than a community of artists and collectors.\n\nExcerpts from the UNESCO declaration are embedded in the piece in the form of asemic writing, infusing the piece with the power of the message as it charms the eye.  The collector will also be able to select one of twenty affirmations to be embedded in the work.  Each minted edition will stand as a prayer flag waving permanently on the blockchain spreading its message of belief in a world where we are all valued and respected.  Cry Diversity will be free to collect, but it comes with a challenge.  The collector is expected to actively research the cryptoArt community to find an artist new to them that is a member of an underrepresented group (female, LBGTQIA2+, female identifying, non-binary, POC, global south, etc.).  They are then expected to actively promote that artist and their work for at least one week.  They are expected to personally raise their voice.  Cry Diversity is the second in a series of projects (see the companion piece fx(elevate)) designed to bring attention to individual artists as well as to the value of true commitment to diversity within our community.  It will not be the last.\n\nIt is time to make our cries heard and our actions felt!\n\n\nCollection Mechanics:\nIn the initial week after launch, holders of any of my past fx(hash) projects may mint a free edition.  Beginning in the 2nd week, the project will be open to the public for an additional week. Un-minted editions will be burned at the expiration of the 2nd week.\n\nMinting Instructions: \n1) Use the Randomized Params button to explore outputs.  \n2) When a design emerges that you want to mint, lock the Seed Input param.  \n3) Choose your Cry.  Lock it.\n4) Mint & enjoy. \n\nParameter Descriptions: \na) Seed Input: Each output is a unique result based on your wallet address and the seed value. If you have recorded the seed for a given output as you explore, you can simply type in the seed to retrieve it.\nb) Cry: What do you want our community to symbolize?  Respect, diversity, compassion?  Choose your favorite characteristic.  It will be baked into your output.\n\nProject Details:\nThis work uses the spectral.js library for the development of color palettes. \n\nCreated by Wanda Oliver (wandaoliver.tez) in June, 2023, this work is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.\n\nThe minter shares secondary royalties with the creator and a beneficiary.\n\nDimensionless design responds to window size.\n\nInteractions:\nPress [D] in live mode to download.

            "description": "\"Slice of Life\" is a part of the live minting experience at Non Fungible Conference Lisbon, June 7-8, 2023. It is a generative art series about seeing beauty in the ordinary, inspired by tree rings and the stories they hold.\n\nWhen I first learned of tree rings as a kid, I thought that a tree meticulously recorded its own life story, similar to how my parents marked my height with dates on the wall behind our kitchen door. Next to each date, there was a small description, some were milestones but most were mundane. We’ve moved across an ocean since then, but tree rings always remind me of my first home, of how my parents cherished and celebrated the small things in life.\n\nInitially I created figurative paintings of tree rings, however they felt a bit too still and lonesome, and lacked the warmth I wanted to convey. Then it dawned on me that while each tree stands on its own, our lives are intertwined with one another. These connections and interactions play a big role in shaping who we are, as well as our sense of home and belonging. From there on the artwork evolved to be messier, more expressive, and more like a slice of life as I see it.\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.06\n\n\nFX params\nThis artwork uses the minter address along with a selectable seed to enable personalization.\nI recommend locking the other params and cycling through the 42 seeds to find your favorite.\nThe palette and initial position of pigments are entirely determined by the seed. The other two params can be used for further customization and may yield some exciting and unexpected results.\n\nKeyboard controls\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount.\n[s] Save a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[3] Change the output resolution, up to 4500x6000px.\n\nURL parameters\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 20]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nLibraries used: p5.js\n",
