            "description": "What is even real and what is artificial?\n\nIn the contemporary light, the division between real and artificial loses weight as the concepts become more and more intertwined. In this work, the artist combines the human and generative inputs, in a counterintuitive manner, by allowing AI to design the organic elements and using the human hand to incorporate artificial glitches. What seemingly emerges as natural forms, was imagined solely by GAN, seeing the world through the limited examples through the photographer’s lenses. Artist’s role is also reversed, as their goal is to design the visual destruction process of the organic forms. Glitch is a malfunction of perception, it symbolizes the confusion caused by not being able to comprehend. \n\nThe human fascination with metaphysical forces spans many centuries. While Pagan mythology created gods living in deep forests and under-explored territories, nowadays we approach technology with somewhat similar awe, fascination, and fear. \n\nThe project has been developed in multiple stages. It started with an inspiration by the Lithuanian landscape and research of the ancient myths and legends. The photography aimed at capturing the mysterious, spanning months and years of different experiences. A custom pre-trained artist’s GAN model was then trained on a collection of several hundred photographs in high resolution. Selected outputs were curated by artist and included as a starting canvas for the next stage. Then, a set of stochastic manipulations were programmed to create alternative narratives through the visual destruction. Fog turns into smoke into burning radioactive forest in an unpredictable manner, guided by the random variables, their boundaries crafted by artist.  \n\nRead more on the project website:\nivonatau.com/mythic-latent-glitches\n\n- Use the \"A\" key to animate (if \"Animated\" feature is present).\n- Press any key to stop the animation.\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.",

            "description": "At the heart of our interconnected lives, \"Mahsus\" emerges as a reflection on the subtle yet profound ways in which intimacy and touch manifest within the digital sphere. This project captures the essence of those fleeting moments where the physical and emotional intertwine, reminiscent of a whispered affection or the gentlest of contacts that leave behind a trace of warmth and closeness.\n\nDrawing from a rich palette of shared experiences that shape our identities and our relationships with the world, \"Mahsus\" invites its audience to delve into the sensations of touch—those that are premeditated and bear an intimate, personal signature. Through this exploration, the work contemplates how such interactions, though often absent in digital exchanges, remain pivotal in our understanding and experience of connection.\n\nBy reimagining the tactile within a digital context, the project offers a meditative space for viewers to engage with the notion of digital intimacy encouraging a contemplation on the ways digital and physical realms can converge, evoking the genuine feeling of being touched, both physically and emotionally.\n\nIn this endeavor, \"Mahsus\" seeks to underscore the emotional and intimate facets of human interaction. It stands as an invitation to experience, to feel, and to reflect on the intricate dance of human connection in our increasingly digital world.\n\n\"Mahsus\" while phonetically reminiscent of the Arabic \"محسوس\" -meaning \"felt\" or \"sensed\"- derives its meaning in Turkish from the Arabic \"مخصوص,\" denoting something specifically intended. This nuanced lineage enriches the project's thematic exploration of deliberate, sensory connection across cultural boundaries.\n\n------\nIn live mode:\n- Press \"S\" to save in PNG format.\n- Press \"P\" to generate higher resolution image (2880x5120 px).\n------\nMade with p5.js\n------\n© 2024 Bassil Taleb.

            "description": "SCHNEEWALD is the second release in a row of about 12 tree/flower generative art works, which have come together over the last 10 years.\n\nThis project explores an approach to trees with snow using a recursive algorithm and includes Three traits: a density layer for the amount of trees and another layer for the amount snow and a third for how strong the branches bend.\n\nRendering progress indicated on the top left border\nPress [s] in live view to download a high resolution png\n\nArtist notes:\nSince I moved to Wandlitz, north of Berlin, in the middle of the \"Naturpark Barnim\" (https://www.barnim-naturpark.de/), in 2003,\nI've done a lot of exploring nearby nature. In addition to the beautiful lake and heath landscapes, I fell in love with the wild acacia forests. These strange trees, sometimes more like huge wild grasses, grow so wildly into each other.\n\nI experienced it in all sorts of seasonal change, packed with snow is definitely among the most amazing! \n\nWhile playing around with different branching system code snippets, a more and more complex image composition came together. The final script for this project on fx(hash) was finally given more randomness for a wider range of different outputs and an additional random grain filter.\n\nProject link: https://e-art.co/project/schneewald/\n\nMany thanks to jesse (jbird) for the good collaboration, which ultimately made it possible to get this work released.\n\ncopyright © 2023 | license cc 4.0 BY-NC-ND",

The collection borrows its name from a 1919 short-story cycle by Sherwood Anderson, which explores a peculiar cast of characters living within a fictionalized, midwestern town. Like Anderson’s text, the “Winesburg, Ohio” algorithm constructs a world through recurring portrayals of specific structures and landmarks. Its scenes are populated by a variety of familiar elements taken from my larger body of work, including water towers, houses, and churches. Meanwhile, a series of scripted gestures insert abstract compositional elements into the outputs, counteracting their pictorial legibility. The strange landscapes that result are composite ideograms, comprised of multiple spatial possibilities that co-exist in varying states of contradiction.",

            "description": "This project is about uncovering artifacts.\n\nEach piece is determined by approximately 15 parameters. This allows for a multitude of possible forms, and each iteration is an artifact to be discovered within the multidimensional space.\n\nThis work is focused around discovery. It is about exploring the space of the algorithm, shedding light on its many forms, and sometimes finding artifacts of the real world embedded within them.\n\nTechnically, this work is a composition of three primary elements: Voronoi tessellations, orthographic projection, and the depth-sort algorithm.\nThe latter of these is integral to the rendering mechanism. It works intuitively, drawing distant objects before near objects, evaluating the distance of each object according to its geometric center. It does this precisely, and in doing so, it can produce interesting visual artifacts, drawing some shapes in an unexpected order.\n\n\n\nThis has been a fascinating study, bringing light to unreal shapes and forms, and uncovering artifacts in an impossible space.\n\nI hope you enjoy it,\nNat Sarkissian\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Notes:\n- Append “&mag=N” to the end of the URL in live mode to specify a resolution multiplier. It will render the image N times larger than the size of your window. If you have specified anything greater than 1, a download will start automatically once the rendering is done.",

            "description": "At the heart of our interconnected lives, \"Mahsus\" emerges as a reflection on the subtle yet profound ways in which intimacy and touch manifest within the digital sphere. This project captures the essence of those fleeting moments where the physical and emotional intertwine, reminiscent of a whispered affection or the gentlest of contacts that leave behind a trace of warmth and closeness.\n\nDrawing from a rich palette of shared experiences that shape our identities and our relationships with the world, \"Mahsus\" invites its audience to delve into the sensations of touch—those that are premeditated and bear an intimate, personal signature. Through this exploration, the work contemplates how such interactions, though often absent in digital exchanges, remain pivotal in our understanding and experience of connection.\n\nBy reimagining the tactile within a digital context, the project offers a meditative space for viewers to engage with the notion of digital intimacy encouraging a contemplation on the ways digital and physical realms can converge, evoking the genuine feeling of being touched, both physically and emotionally.\n\nIn this endeavor, \"Mahsus\" seeks to underscore the emotional and intimate facets of human interaction. It stands as an invitation to experience, to feel, and to reflect on the intricate dance of human connection in our increasingly digital world.\n\n\"Mahsus\" while phonetically reminiscent of the Arabic \"محسوس\" -meaning \"felt\" or \"sensed\"- derives its meaning in Turkish from the Arabic \"مخصوص,\" denoting something specifically intended. This nuanced lineage enriches the project's thematic exploration of deliberate, sensory connection across cultural boundaries.\n\n------\nIn live mode:\n- Press \"S\" to save in PNG format.\n- Press \"P\" to generate higher resolution image (2880x5120 px).\n------\nMade with p5.js\n------\n© 2024 Bassil Taleb.

            "description": "\"Isometric Dreams\" is a visionary journey into the architectural essence of the mind's deepest narratives, set for release on the winter solstice, December 21st. This project invites viewers into a labyrinth of geometric splendor, mirroring the transition from the shortest day to the longest night.\n\nThe project comprises a series of digital canvases where light and shadow play across isometric landscapes, creating a cityscape of the subconscious. The vivid hues—fiery oranges, lush greens, and icy blues—burn and glow against the stark contrasts of shadow, symbolizing the ancient duality of the solstice: darkness surrendering to light.\n\nOn this most enigmatic of nights, when shadows stretch their longest and the veil between worlds grows thin, \"Isometric Dreams\" offers a visual homage to the mysteries of the unseen. The stark geometry, a nod to the order within chaos, contrasts with the swirling, dream-like quality of the overlaid patterns, suggests the intricate complexities of human cognition and the ethereal nature of our dreams.\n\nAlthough the artworks in this project are static, they evoke dynamic emotional and subconscious experiences. Each piece, unchanging in form, sparks a personal journey of perception and interpretation, connecting the viewer's inner world with the timeless themes of light, time, and cognition.\n\n3500x4953px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023",

            "description": "At the heart of our interconnected lives, \"Mahsus\" emerges as a reflection on the subtle yet profound ways in which intimacy and touch manifest within the digital sphere. This project captures the essence of those fleeting moments where the physical and emotional intertwine, reminiscent of a whispered affection or the gentlest of contacts that leave behind a trace of warmth and closeness.\n\nDrawing from a rich palette of shared experiences that shape our identities and our relationships with the world, \"Mahsus\" invites its audience to delve into the sensations of touch—those that are premeditated and bear an intimate, personal signature. Through this exploration, the work contemplates how such interactions, though often absent in digital exchanges, remain pivotal in our understanding and experience of connection.\n\nBy reimagining the tactile within a digital context, the project offers a meditative space for viewers to engage with the notion of digital intimacy encouraging a contemplation on the ways digital and physical realms can converge, evoking the genuine feeling of being touched, both physically and emotionally.\n\nIn this endeavor, \"Mahsus\" seeks to underscore the emotional and intimate facets of human interaction. It stands as an invitation to experience, to feel, and to reflect on the intricate dance of human connection in our increasingly digital world.\n\n\"Mahsus\" while phonetically reminiscent of the Arabic \"محسوس\" -meaning \"felt\" or \"sensed\"- derives its meaning in Turkish from the Arabic \"مخصوص,\" denoting something specifically intended. This nuanced lineage enriches the project's thematic exploration of deliberate, sensory connection across cultural boundaries.\n\n------\nIn live mode:\n- Press \"S\" to save in PNG format.\n- Press \"P\" to generate higher resolution image (2880x5120 px).\n------\nMade with p5.js\n------\n© 2024 Bassil Taleb.
