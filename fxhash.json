            "description": "\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" (\"the ineffable moment of the colorful discovery\")  is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at The Ever-Evolving World of Art, Art Basel Hong-Kong, 2022.\n\nIt is a tribute to playful discovery. This work was commissioned for the Art Basel Hong Kong / Tezos / fxhash collaboration, as part of an activity to introduce visitors into generative art. As I was pondering what could I do in the short time available, I saw my youngest daughter drawing: the ineffable moment of colorful discovery. Child play is one of the most discovery-filled activities I can think of. And drawing is that joy that I describe: a blank piece of paper with a crayon is pure possibility. Which is what generative art is. I had wanted for quite some time to create a tribute to those drawings my daughters do, and this has been the perfect occasion to start it: it seemed to me that it fit the occasion perfectly: kids discover through painting, maybe adults can discover generative art using the same visual language.\n\n\"el inefable momento del colorido descubrimiento\" is a work that explores colour and irregular basic shapes, and that leaves the viewer in front of a new space with each execution. Does it trigger any excitement to see those imperfect elements? It is dearest to me to see the hearts and rainbows, as two mainstays of the drawings that I keep in folders and count in the hundreds and thousands. Can an algorithm that reproduces those elements trigger the same warm feelings in the viewer? It does with me.\n\nThe piece lets the viewer explore certain characteristics. The viewer can pause the iterations: each is just an execution of the same drawing, slightly different. When paused, one can look at each line individually and notice how the drawing is constructed. When running, it gives an idea of how the things we know are just versions of the ideal concept they represent. \n\nAlso, one can have an idea of what would have happened if the child had decided to draw more or less elements. The viewer can press “e” to see different variations of the same piece: random elements are selected and displayed. To restore the original work, press “r”. Which one is the “finished” artwork? All of them. What is “the” artwork? \n\nThe work has the following commands:\n\n- Change the work: “e”. To restore: “r”\n- The painting can be paused/unpaused pressing “p”\n- The viewer can save an artwork pressing “s” (it will pause the piece, press \"p\" to unpause)\n- The resolution can be arbitrarily changed pressing “d” followed by a number from 1 to 9. If the image goes dark and nothing paints, press “d 0” (d zero) and try again with a lower number. Resolution can be increased iteratively: press d 2, then d 2, etc. It will always add the amount to the current pixel density, thus increasing resolution.\n- The viewer can see how many decisions are made per iteration. This might be interesting to those who don’t know how generative art works. Each iteration is composed of thousands of decisions that inform colour, positions, shapes, etc. To toggle the decision count view, press “q”\n- It has also colour controls: press z for brightness, x for contrast, g for gamma, b for blur, n for noise followed by + or - to alter their values. You might get some simple variations that you might enjoy. Press a to enable/disable all colour controls (except the noise).\n- There are some pre-recorded colour variations: press “v” followed by 1, 2 or 3. Press “v” followed by 0 (zero) to reset the variations.\n\nIn every process of discovery, one comes to an \"aha\" moment ;) If you find your aha moment, then you can do one more thing: you can play with the size of certain elements pressing “o”. To restore, reload the piece. Once you find your aha moment, you can go back the same way you got there. All the controls work the same when one has reached their aha moment.\n\nI hope you enjoy the piece as much as I have enjoyed drawing it, directly or indirectly, with my daughters. Thanks.\n\nArtwork by Marcelo Soria-Rodríguez, @msoriaro.\nMade with p5js and glsl.",

            "description": "The only time I ever received corporal punishment – something that was still legal in schools during the 1970s – was in Double Maths with Mrs Robinson. The log book spread out before me seemed less appealing than talking with my friends at the back of the classroom, and so it was I found myself, palm outstretched, feeling the whack of Mrs. Robinson's ruler, ten times over. \"Math sucks.\" Or so I thought.\n\nBack then I knew nothing of the beauty that I would later see in Mathematics – something which became apparent as I taught myself to code, especially using Processing.\n\nThis work – based on code I've been playing around with since 2009 – is my small homage to that beauty. Originally based on Ulam spirals, I've then played around with that starting formula to create an infinite numbers of patterns using square roots, cosines and modulus. If only they had shown me these possibilities when I was younger I may have avoided the dreaded ruler of Mrs. Robinson.\n\n",

            "description": "“Sparsely Populated Grid” is the result of an architect’s fascination with Cartographies and a crypto-enthusiast love for Neo Punk aesthetics. The first sketch, drawn by hand with Procreate, was made in October 2021.\n\nThis is an exploration on the field of Generative Cartographies, an abstract diagrammatic representation of a randomly generated area within the virtual IPFS world. Everything starts with an GRID of varying sizes and angles, subsequently POPULATED by a random number of forms. But, how to populate the grid? SPARSELY, of course, with just the right amount of superpositions.\n\nThe algorithm produces varying compositions of fourteen different forms, with seven possible mixes and ten colour palettes. Movement, made possible by its generative digital nature, follows sinusoidal patterns, as if the forms breathed and danced to an unheard music.\n\nBesides, they never forget to celebrate birthdays.\n\n\n// INTERACTIVITY\n\n- CLICK or SPACEBAR to stop movement.\n- UP and DOWN ARROWS to Disable/Enable graphic elements such as texts (wink).\n- LEFT and RIGHT ARROWS (when stopped) to Move frames back and forth.\n- Press 1 for a low-res PNG.\n- Press 2 for a medium-res PNG (3x).\n- Press 3 for a hi-res PNG (6x).\n- Press G for Glitch (low-res).\n- Press P for PixelArt (low-res).\n\nIf you want a different resolution, you can also add ?&res=xxx to the url to get your desired output. Then simply Right-Click SAVE the canvas -- experimental",

Bears are captured and forced to fight dogs. Marine mammals, such as whales and dolphins, get trapped in discarded fishing gear. Wild animals are traded as exotic pets.\n\nWe should end the needless suffering of animals.\nWe should influence decision makers to put animals on the global agenda.\nWe should help the world see how important animals are to all of us.\nWe inspire people to change animals’ lives for the better.\nWe should move the world to protect animals.\n\n------------------\n\nOstriches are large flightless birds of the genus Struthio in the order Struthioniformes, part of the infra-class Palaeognathae, a diverse group of flightless birds also known as ratites that includes the emus, rheas, and kiwis. There are two living species of ostrich: the common ostrich, native to large areas of sub-Saharan Africa and the Somali ostrich, native to the Horn of Africa.[2] The common ostrich was also historically native to the Arabian Peninsula, and ostriches were present across Asia as far east as Mongolia during the Late Pleistocene and possibly into the Holocene. They lay the largest eggs of any living land animal. With the ability to run at 70 km/h (43.5 mph), they are the fastest birds on land. They are farmed worldwide, particularly for their feathers as they are used as decoration and feather dusters. Their skin is also used for leather products. Ostriches are notable for being the heaviest living birds. -- Wikipedia --",

It is recommended that you view the work in 4K or 6K to appreciate the finer details. \n\nThe keyboard buttons: “2”, “4”, and “6” can be pressed to change the resolution to 2K, 4K and 6K resolution accordingly. \n\nTo download an image at its current resolution, press the keyboard button “S”.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nArtwork created with p5.js\n\n@nbswwit\nSept 2022\n",

            "description": "BRIDGE is a collaborative project for fx(hash), conceived by Camille Roux. The project was announced on Twitter on Feb. 7, 2022 [1]. Artists were given two weeks to contribute code that would draw tiles representing a bridge, in their own style. Artists were free to implement their own artistic vision, subject to one simple constraint: Respect the coordinates of the tiles for each iteration of the art. \n\nEach iteration has a default style determined randomly at mint. This style is named in the features and displayed in the thumbnail. However, each iteration includes all styles, and you can cycle through them by clicking on or touching the image. Styles will be shown in the order in which they are listed under INCLUDED STYLES.\n\nPress \"s\" to save a screenshot.\n\nTHE STORY\n\nI'm Camille Roux. I planned to do a lot of collab this year with fx(hash) artists I like, but it takes too much time, or maybe I like too many artists :) Some days ago, I woke up with this idea in mind: \"Hey! What if I make a collaboration with all the artists I like at once!\" This is how the BRIDGE project was born.\n\nMoreover, I love the mutual aid and solidarity between fx(hash) generative artists. The BRIDGE can be seen as a symbol of the link between us ♥️.\n\nThe project has also served as an inspiration for participants to extend and develop their coding skills outside their usual areas of interest. The code for the entire project remains available on GitHub [2].\n\nTHE INCLUDED STYLES\n\nText-to-Bridge (TTB) by Ada Ada Ada\nhttps://twitter.com/ada_ada_ada_art\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ada%20Ada%20Ada\n\nBlest Path by Anaglyphic\nhttps://twitter.com/anaglyph_ic\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/anaglyphic\n\nThe Old Woody Dock by Aqw_Zert\nhttps://twitter.com/Aqw_Zert\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Aqw_Zert\n\nBridge-Tunnel by Laurent Houdard\nhttps://twitter.com/CablesAndPixels\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Laurent%20Houdard\n\nEvaporating by Camille Roux\nhttps://twitter.com/camillerouxart\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Camille%20Roux\n\nBuildings by Camille Roux\nhttps://twitter.com/camillerouxart\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Camille%20Roux\n\nTGH Bridge by David Esq\nhttps://twitter.com/emcyze\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/David%20Esq\n\nCitadel by devnull\nhttps://twitter.com/lostpunks\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/devnull\n\nEinstein–Rosen by Elsif\nhttps://twitter.com/ElsifThen\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/elsif\n\nPath through the city by Estienne\nhttps://twitter.com/Estienne_ca\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Estienne\n\nstarry night//glitchy night by frederative\nhttps://twitter.com/frederative\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/frederative\n\nBlackboard by Generative Pen\nhttps://twitter.com/GenerativePen\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Generative%20Pen\n\nMozaik by Gorik\nhttps://twitter.com/gorikfr\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Gorik\n\nDevour by grosgg\nhttps://twitter.com/rosgg\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/grosgg\n\nburning bridges by jeres\nhttps://twitter.com/heyjeres\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/jeres\n\nSpace Disco Dancefloor by Julien Labat\nhttps://twitter.com/JulienLabat\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/julabat\n\n/nt/r/t///a/ by lunarean\nhttps://twitter.com/lunarean\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/lunarean\n\nNara by Makio64\nhttps://twitter.com/makio64\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Makio64\n\nBifrost by mandyBrigwell\nhttps://twitter.com/mandybrigwell\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/mandybrigwell\n\nRain under the stars by Matt Circles\nhttps://twitter.com/matt_circles\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Matt%20Circles\n\nEsoteric Oasis by Nick Dima\nhttps://twitter.com/nickdima\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Nick%20Dima\n\nStreet Lights by phil_osophie\nhttps://twitter.com/phil_osophie\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/phil_osophie\n\nRise by Robin Metcalfe\nhttps://twitter.com/solarise_webdev\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Robin\n\nFlower Bridge by RVig\nhttps://twitter.com/rvig_art\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/rvig\n\nhere comes the sun by shuhblam\nhttps://twitter.com/shuhblam\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/shuhblam\n\nInto another world by Claus O.
