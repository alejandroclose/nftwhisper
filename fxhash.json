            "description": "\"Earthquakes don't kill people, buildings do.\" – Unknown\n\nEarthquakes are not just natural disasters, but also human tragedies. They can strike suddenly and violently, leaving behind a trail of destruction and trauma that can last a lifetime. For survivors, the experience of an earthquake can be life changing.\n\nHomes and neighborhoods are reduced to rubble, and the familiar landmarks and memories of a lifetime are wiped away in an instant. In the aftermath of an earthquake, survivors must grapple with the emotional toll of their loss, the uncertainty of the future, and the challenge of rebuilding their lives.\n\nThe first step after a disaster is to provide emergency medical care, shelter, and basic necessities like food and water. Once these immediate needs are met, attention can turn to assessing the damage and developing a plan for reconstruction.\n\nThe rebuilding process can be a long and challenging journey, as it involves not only repairing physical damage but also restoring the social fabric of affected communities, addressing issues like housing, infrastructure, and economic recovery, as well as addressing the psychological and emotional impact of the disaster on individuals and communities.\n\nIt is crucial to rebuild using proper techniques and investing in the right resources to prevent similar disasters from happening in the future. Reconstruction must be done with a focus on resilience, sustainability, and safety. This means taking into consideration the local conditions, the latest research on earthquake-resistant materials and designs, and the needs of the affected communities.\n\nThe cost of not investing in proper reconstruction after an earthquake can be immense. Poorly constructed buildings and infrastructure can increase the risk of further damage in the event of another earthquake, leading to more loss of life and property. On the other hand, investing in proper reconstruction can help create a safer and more resilient environment, reducing the impact of future earthquakes and protecting the lives and livelihoods of those who call the affected region home.\n\nFor this reason, it is crucial that regions impacted by earthquakes receive immediate and adequate economic and technical support, and that available resources are managed with proper planning and great responsibility.\n\nThis generative art project explores the destructive power of earthquakes and seeks to capture the raw emotions of those who have experienced earthquakes and the transformation of their world into a memory.\n\n100% of the primary split is going to @tezquakeaid, Tezos community initiative providing aid to the victims of the catastrophic earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria on February 6, 2023. \nOnce again the Tezos community has proven to be special. 💚\n\nHand coded after midnight.\nPowered by p5, matter & chroma.\n\n======> COMMANDS (In Live Mode) <======\n\nPress ‘s’ to save the current output.\nThe generation takes some time but you can see the simulation and drawing process happening in real-time.\n\nSettings are passed as URL parameters and pressing the following keys, the artwork will regenerate at a different scale:\n\n- 1 -> 1.920x1.080\n- 2 -> 4.000x2.252\n- 3 -> 6.000x3.378\n- 4 -> 8.000x4.504\n\n=============> MAKING OF <=============\n\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/article/the-making-of-mercalli",

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px). It may last for high numbers.\nWe recommend the use of Chrome browser in order to render properly the texture.\n\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 × 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.net",

            "description": "“How hands can create the vision that germinates in my mind? And what if the vision directly sprouts from the hands instead of the mind”, the artist asks.\n“Is the vision thrown through the shadow of the hands, or is the shadow hands the vision itself?”, the magician responds.\nAs an attempt to add a line to this whimsical dialogue, I dropped shadows to cast visions. To my great surprise, the artist and the magician blent into each other…\n\n- - -\n\n“Ombromanie” refers to the art of creating images made by hand shadows. The word and the art (also called “shadowgraphy”) was popularized by french magician Félicien Trewey in the XIXth century. Sure the shadow art is not so popular nowadays, but it still shares with generative art part of the same mystery and magic. The code projects shapes and colors on a screen to create images; the hands project a shadow on a curtain to create figures.\n\n“Ombromanie” was conceived as a curtain where articulated hands (or better, shadow of hands) throw a firework of shapes, creating a wide range of random compositions. I heard the magician words and I did implement five features for this magical trick:\n- the curtain can be entire or hemmed,\n- the image oriented the right way up or upside-down,\n- one or two hands can be used for the invocation,\n- the phatasmagoria reveals itself as syzygy or chaos,\n- and climax is reached through twelve ways.\nHands are always present, but in extremely rare cases they could vanish behind the curtain…   \n\n- - - \n\nThis project uses twelve custom color palettes – the climaxes.\nTen are inspired after works or body of works by well known generative artists. A kind of tribute for the constant inspiration and creativity of the magicians-artists.\n- “Hollow” by @jMarkusiewicz\n- “Garden, Monoliths” by @zancan\n- “Uninhabitable” by @pointline_\n- “Mimizu” by @qubibien\n- “aether:Astral Loom” by @lisaorthstudio\n- “gestalt” by @Yazid\n- “Perpendicular Inhabitation” (night) by @StudioYorktown\n- “Anaverse” by @anaglyph_ic\n- “Take wing” by @mwiederrecht\n- “contrapuntos” by @msoriaro\nThe eleventh palette is named “fakewhale”(@fakewhale_xyz), who, months ago, encouraged me to learn and try code to create generative works. Special thanks to them for the support and dialogue.\nThe twelfth palette refers to my first long form generative project called ”thébaïde”.\n\n- - -\n\nA small word about the “phatasmagoria” part, which tells about the invisible thread that sews my artistic approach. This part is a modified and extended code I used to create a set of six pieces titled “Sketches for unreliable structure” (Objkt, December 2022). And those were already an echo from a selection of digital (but not coded) works from “The Queue Structure” project (Objkt, since May 2022). Finally, The Queue Structure itself was a visual laboratory nourished by my previous practice of abstraction in the tangible world (drawing, collage, monotype, engraving). \n\n- - -\n\nPress “s” in live mode to save the work as a PNG (default 2000 × 2000 px).\nAdd to the URL ”&size=n” (number from 3 to 10) to render an image at higher resolution (from 3000 px to 10000 px). It may last for high numbers.\nWe recommend the use of Chrome browser in order to render properly the texture.\n\nMade with p5js | 2023\nPng | 2000 × 2000 px | 72 ppi\n\nwww.antoniowerli.net",

Cherish this mesmerising world of yours as you would a ripe summer fruit, and behold at a glance its delicate yet dynamic balance — one change here or there, no matter how microscopic, affects the entire course of your world. \n\nHow will you receive this world – its situations that overwhelm, its sights that awe, the catastrophes, the serenity, its steadfast commitment to the present? Will you look upon all of us here, adrift and fragile together, with love?\n\n\nAdrift is a project that reminds us to make peace with our world – with all worlds – by stepping back to make space for an all-encompassing perspective.\n\n\n------------\n\n\nCreated by Jacek Markusiewicz @jMarkusiewicz\nCreative collaboration with Tender @tender_art\n\nClick on the image for resolution options and to save a .png file. Saving higher resolutions may not work in some browsers; in these cases, right-click-save the image. All drawing and geometric methods are written by mrkswcz using javascript, except for the following:\n\nThe pseudorandom terrain generation uses Hydraulic-Erosion by Sebastian Lague, inspired by \"Reconnaissance\" by TENDER x Nat Sarkissian (MIT License).\n\nFor finding paths that simulate connections in terrain and potential locations of cities, a C# script was adapted from the article \"Pathfinding Algorithms in C#\" by Kristian Ekman published in Code Project licensed under The Code Project Open License (CPOL). The code was translated to javascript and simplified for performance.\n\nMany pseudorandom effects are achieved with perlin-simplex by David Guttman and seedrandom by David Bau (both MIT Licenses)\n\nFor more information, please see the bundle.js.LICENSE.txt file included in the package.\n\nThe \"heat death\" event is a small tribute to lunarean's fxhash project. The code that generates the disintegration effect interprets a fragment of lunarean's code. Further contributions are its adaptation for 3d transformations and its recursive character that modifies certain parameters over time.\n\nThe project uses CPU for calculations and rendering – generating the image requires up to 500MB of free RAM.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "A kaleidoscope is an object that consists of a tube or cylinder with a set of mirrors inside, which reflect symmetrical images of colored objects or glass fragments. When you look through the viewer of the kaleidoscope, these images multiply into complex and fascinating patterns.\n\nThe reflections in the kaleidoscope are created by the mirrors inside the cylinder. Typically, there are three or four mirrors, which are placed at specific angles to create the reflected patterns. When light enters the tube, it is reflected by the mirrors, creating a symmetrical image of the object or glass fragment placed at the end of the cylinder.\n\nThe result is a series of reflected images that repeat in geometric patterns, creating a mesmerizing visual effect. Each time you rotate the kaleidoscope, the images transform into new and surprising combinations of colors and shapes.\n\nIn summary, a kaleidoscope is a tool that creates fascinating and colorful reflective images. The reflections are created by the mirrors inside the cylinder and multiply into complex and symmetrical patterns. It's a great way to explore the properties of light and color while creating visually appealing and mesmerizing images.\n\nIn this project, I drew inspiration from the mesmerizing reflections and variations that a kaleidoscope can create, as well as its simple yet elegant design. Using p5.js, I explored the potential for generating variations of Hydra, and experimented with integrating hex colors into the Hydra workflow.\n\nBy building on the concepts of the kaleidoscope, I aimed to create a unique and visually appealing project that showcases the beauty and complexity of reflective patterns. The addition of hex colors to Hydra brings an exciting new dimension to the project, allowing for a greater range of color variations and visual effects.\n\nOverall, this project represents an exploration of the intersection between art, technology, and design, and serves as a testament to the power of creative experimentation and exploration.\n\n\nAll profits make on this project will be donated tofamilies and homeless people affected by the disaster on the north coast of São Paulo.\n",
