            "description": "\"Euphoria\" embodies my pleasurable exploration and playfulness in geometry to produce a whole unit of an image that reminds me of my old cubist painting exercises. \"Euphoria\" ends from diagonal lines to different levels of flat color, surfaces, and shapes. The scene of this work in forms creates small boxes with fragile perspectives; this performance challenges the root concept that art should copy nature. A theme that is evident in all my works. Therefore, the unusual geometrical divisions generate outstanding space in the flat forms.\nAngles are generated that may simultaneously form a two-way perspective. It is a sensory experience imposed by the \"external sense\" and time similarly by the \"internal sense.\" It is the experience of a visual world that combines the visual aura of space and time. According to Kant, such a combination is the foundation of self-awareness.\nAccording to him, intuitions should \"move through each other and be held together.\" That is, they should be placed in time and some of them in place (the spatial component appears as a position outside intuition). Second, the previous intuitions must be placed next to the current intuitions to form a single body.\nThis process constitutes the initial formalist. Such a method is undoubtedly an attempt to abandon all resemblance to natural form and to create a completely abstract language of form, including a visual symphony. \"Euphoria\" strives to achieve abstract minimalism by exploring new geometric structures, using algorithms, and building them into code structures.\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nArtist: @ChistaAi",

Move the parameters freely to create your designs.\n\nHowever, completion is short-lived.\n\nIn a matter of seconds, the copies multiply repeatedly.\n\nModifications, alterations, and revisions are applied to the objects.\n\nConcurrently, the paper's decay and replication-induced noise compound on the drawing's surface.\n\nThis process repeats, archives, and...\n\nThe drawing becomes progressively more challenging to decipher.\n\nRandomized years of passage are set.\n\nThe longer the passage, the lengthier the animation, and the more effects overlap on the drawing. Enjoy the evolving animation.\n\nVertical lines flow from left to right throughout the animation.\n\nEach second represents a fictional decay of 10 years, and the year markings regress.\n\nOrigin and Creation of the Artwork:\n\nCurrently involved in the field of architecture, I've come across numerous old architectural drawings. These often prove difficult to interpret due to the obscurity caused by dirt and noise when compared to contemporary blueprints.\n\nWhile deciphering these intricate drawings, the idea emerged to represent the unique replication noise of copiers. Additionally, there's a fondness for the inherent aging of paper, which imparts a sense of history. Drawings that have been cherished and preserved for years progressively deteriorate due to fading and dirt.\n\nI aimed to combine the vintage deterioration seen in old maps and books with the noise generated by machines, creating an effect function.\n\nThe effects encompass both machine noise and aging noise.\n\nFor stochastic noise, I designed functions based on the same principles as actual photocopying. Colors are obtained from the original layer, slight discrepancies in position and color are introduced, and the color is redrawn.\n\nFor aging noise, I incorporated effects simulating wetting and drying of paper, hole formation, rust stains, and more.\n\nPress the 's' key to save the animation as a PNG.\n\nDue to being a beginner, there might be occasional malfunctions in parameters or hash values, and I appreciate your understanding.\n\nPlease share many of your original objects! With gratitude, I'll mix them all up:)\n\nI hope you enjoy it.\n\nFurthermore, I express gratitude to fxhash for allowing me to artistically manifest such ideas and share them with everyone.\n\nAlso, from my early years, I've always admired my father, who used to pore over blueprints. I think I created this work because I aspire to be like him.\n\n劣華-Rekka- について、\n\n\nこのアニメーション作品は、紙の複写ノイズと経年劣化がテーマです。\n\nコピーを重ねて生じるノイズ、紙そのものの風化や劣化が図面の内容や詳細が次第に見え難くなっていく様子を表現したアニメーション絵画作品です。\n\nあらゆるノイズエフェクトによってオリジナル状態が、\n複雑なビジュアルに書き換えられます。\n\nparamにてオリジナルの図形を描いてみてください。\nオブジェクトは、円、線、寸法線など。パラーメーターを自由に動かしてみてください。\n\n完成したのも束の間。\n\n数秒後にはコピーが何回も繰り返されます。\n\nオブジェクトに対し改変、変更、修正案が加えられます。\nそれと同時に紙の劣化、複写によるノイズが重ねて図面上に記録されてしまいます。\n\n\nそれがまた複写され、保存され、、、\nどんどん図面は解読が困難になっていきます。\n\nランダムに経過年数が設定されます。\n\n経過年数が長いほど、アニメーション時間は長くなります。\nその分図面上で起こるエフェクトは多く重なり合います。\nその変わりゆくアニメーションをお楽しみください。\n\nアニメーション中は縦線が左から右へと流れていきます。\n\n一秒毎に10年の劣化をフィクション値とし、年号が遡っていきます。\n\n-創案と経緯-\n\n私自身、現在、建築関係に携わっています。\nその中で、古い建築図の見る事があるのですが、\n現行の図面に比べて、汚れやノイズで見えづらい事が多々あります。\n\nそのような難解な図面を解読しているうちに、コピー機独特の複写ノイズを表現したいと考えました。\n\nまた、紙本来の経年劣化に、歴史を感じる愛おしさがありました。\n長年にわたって大切に保管された図面は原型を留めながらも、\nくすみや、汚れによって劣化していきます。\n\n古地図や古書に感じるビンテージな劣化と、\n機械的に生じたノイズの混同を表現できたらとエフェクト関数を制作していきました。\n\nエフェクトには、機械系ノイズと、劣化系ノイズがあります。\n\n機会的なノイズは、実際のコピーと同じ原理の関数を作りました。\nオリジナルレイヤーの色を取得し、元の位置と誤差を生じさせて、色を再度描画する。\n\n劣化ノイズでは、紙が濡れて乾いたような表現、穴が空くエフェクト、錆汚れ等。\n\n\"s\"キーPNG保存可能です。\n\nビギナーの為、パラメータやハッシュ値に誤動作がある可能性がありますがご了承ください。\n\n是非みなさんのたくさんのオリジナルオブジェクトを見せてください！！\n感謝をこめてぐちゃぐちゃにします:)\n\n\n楽しんでいただけると幸いです。",

Just as sunlight rapidly and captivatingly reflects off stained glass windows of eastern palaces, spreading a unique tapestry of light and shadow on the walls and floors, The Pazyryk conveys a distinctive experience of art and history through the rare abstraction of color and light. Each color palette simultaneously encapsulates a visualization of history and contemporary reflections, inviting us to a mesmerizing celebration of colors and forms.\n\n-\"To propagate the essence of My wonderful community, 50% of the royalty from each secondary sale will be attributed to minters.\"\n\nNOTE: \"This code follows a complex algorithm for its creation, so you may need to wait a bit for each result to load.

            "description": "This experimental project involves an on-chain cellular automaton. The features and cellular automaton rules are derived from the minter's address. Being the first (unto my knowledge) project on fxhash that generates the artwork completely on chain, it seemed fitting to draw inspiration from one of the first projects on fxhash, \"RGB Elementary Cellular Automaton\".\n\nWhat is this?\n\nAn experimental generative token that integrates on-chain generation, and on-chain storage of the artwork. This is accomplished using a custom smart contract. The artwork is generated using the generate_on_chain entrypoint in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt, and the generated image is subsequently stored on-chain as a byte-string of pixels (row-major order) in the tokens bigmap in KT1GRFujk5m6feK7gJcqCU7ijJkFgx5JigEt.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nSmart contracts have a default entrypoint which is automatically called when XTZ is sent to the contract. By using a smart contract as the primary address, the default entrypoint will be called every time a token is minted. Of course, to prevent accounts from bypassing the fxhash contracts and sending XTZ directly to the smart contract, generating and storing the artwork on-chain, the smart contract checks that an fxhash contract is the account sending XTZ. In this smart contract, the default entrypoint immediately calls the generate_on_chain entrypoint for the sole purpose of making the generation process more apparent on indexers like tzkt.\n\nIn order to make this project compatible with fxhash, the artwork produced by the code submitted to fxhash must be identical to that which is produced by the generative algorithm within the smart contract. At the time of development, the minter's address is the only piece of information which is readily accessible via the fxhash snippet API and in the smart contract. As a result, each account can only generate a single unique artwork (this is enforced by the contract). In the future, this issue could be solved if the fxhash snippet API provided access to the iteration number, as the smart contract could also keep track of this information quite easily.\n\nConsequently, collectors who wish to collect more than one iteration must create additional accounts to mint. The tokens can then be subsequently transferred as per usual.\n\nWhy is the variations preview disabled?\n\nBecause the minter's address is the source of randomness for the generated artwork, not the hash provided by fxhash, changing the hash in the variations preview will have no effect. To see different variations of the artwork you need to modify the fxminter URL parameter in live preview mode.\n\nWhy does the mint button not work on the fxhash frontend?\n\nCurrently, the fxhash frontend has a default storage limit for mint operations that is less than what is required to store the generated image on chain. As a result, the mint button will fail on the fxhash frontend. To get around this, you can mint this token on a mini-website I created (https://blockchain-automaton.netlify.app/), or on Better Call Dev, or by injecting the transaction directly onto the blockchain.\n\nBut Why?\n\nBecause experimentation is fun.",

            "description": "It may appear as an indecipherable map to some. To others, it may present itself as a cross section of an underground cave. Or maybe an uncanny landscape of volcanic activity, a diagram of geological strata, or even something else entirely. Some vague structure may also appear; is it the remains of an ancient civilization? Or perhaps a glimpse into our own tomorrow?\n\nIn \"Agharta\", I sought to create a generative work that could invite the viewer to explore the depths of their imagination and uncover hidden structures within the seemingly chaotic composition. The idea came to me when I was exploring Simplex noise and pixel displacement in Cables. I was surprised by the emergent structures that appeared when some set of parameters paired with the right texture. \n\nThe title of the piece references the mythical underground world said to be located at the earth's core. This idea of hidden depths and secret worlds within the earth resonates with the abstract and enigmatic nature of the result generated by the noise. Imagery of landscape, vague structures, or geological features may appear but never stand out on its own; it exists in a state of constant flow and intersection as if viewed from another dimension. And just like the myth itself that bring up numerous theories that doesn’t necessarily connected to each other, it hints at that idea of an elusive imagined realm while never actually represent it completely.\n\n\n\n=========\n\nControls:\n\n[1] Set resolution to 716 x 1024px (default)\n\n[2] Set resolution to 1433 x 2048px\n\n[3] Set resolution to 2688 x 3840px\n\n* The presets above are suitable for screen viewing up to 4k screen resolution. To set a custom resolution for printing and other purpose, add &res=[desired resolution] at the end of the URL. It will set the height of the image, and the width will be calculated automatically at 0.7 ratio. For example to get a resolution of 4911 x 7016px (about the size of A2 paper), add &res=7016 as URL parameter.\n\n[Scroll/pinch] to zoom and drag to pan\n\n[r] or [zoom out to max] Reset position\n\n[c] Capture a screenshot of the current state at rendered resolution\n\n\nNotes:\n\n* This project use shaders that relies on GPU. Hi-res output may slow down your device. Since it also utilize GPU instance for thumbnail rendering, expect longer time for every iterations to be signed by fx(hash).\n\n* If 'glitching' occurs or the composition behaves differently at different resolution, just refresh the page to reset it (except for the thin lines, which are always drawn at approximately 1 pixel, so expect it to vary at different resolution).\n\nMade with cables.gl, a node-based webgl environment\n\nXALTED 2022",

So, I named the algorithm 'Kralen', which means 'beads' in Dutch.\n\nThe algorithm 'Kralen' creates random bezier curves using the edges of a rectangular boundary, and places beads atop these curves to create a 'bead maze' effect. The algorithm offers different curve creation modes, with the most common mode being 'Mix'. In this mode, two random edges of the boundary are chosen to form bezier curves. Other modes create curves that are horizontally or vertically oriented, or formed using only the corners of the boundary\n\n---\n\nThe work is created with p5.js with the help of bezier.js for working with bezier curves.",

The image is inspired by the spinning hurricane icons that were burned into his brain by the constant weather coverage.\n\nThe image is a simple tessellation, a grid of overlapping spiral tiles. The number of rows and columns are equal, loosely representing the categories of a hurricane.\n\nThe image is a metaphor for the storm's progression. As the storm forms slowly, the image is light and airy, with few elements interacting. As the number of rows and columns increase, the image darkens and becomes more complex, representing the storm's increasing power and destructiveness.\n\nDr. Kolomyjec has experienced several hurricanes, and he is in awe of the power of nature. He believes that we should respect nature and not take it lightly.\n\nCopyright 2023 Dr. Bill Kolomyjec. All Rights Reserved.\n\nPlease visir www.drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",
