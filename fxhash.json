Simple patterns, shapes, textures, and colors are arranged in randomly selected ways. Overlaying shapes distort and blend, breaking these objects apart and causing complex forms to emerge. Combining these individual features together results in varying outcomes, from surprisingly simple to wildly chaotic.\n\n---------------\n\nControls:\nPress 1-6 to change the scale of the canvas (1 = default, 2500px x 2500px, 6 = 15,000px x 15,000px)\nS (or double tap on mobile): Save output at current size\nC: Toggle cutout shapes visibility\nH: Toggle cutout outlines visibility\nB: Iterate border sizes (none, default, 1.5x, 2x, 3x)\nT: Toggle texture visibility\nF: Toggle fullscreen\nAdd the url params x and y to set custom dimensions.

            "description": "Everything is divisible. Larger organisms are made up of smaller ones, entire galaxies are comprised of stars, planets, people, dust, and one effect here and now ripples into eternity. Nothing exists without the elemental components that have evolved to make them possible — and nothing on the plane of existence arrives in isolation from something greater. This enmeshed reality is the concept of a Holon: a whole that is simultaneously part of another whole. \n\nAs cells, energies, beings, and ideas grow in complexity, each new advancement includes and transcends their holons, the very catalysts of evolution. What does this essential process look like on its own when scale, context, and definition are removed? The senses are forced to purely observe the present interactions and reactions that occur between all parts. This is what Holons attempts to portray — the witnessing of birth, formation, and crystallization simultaneously. \n\nUpon viewing each piece and inspecting its detail with curiosity — we can observe living reality that has been temporarily suspended from motion and artificially stopped for us to witness. Can we see what is a part, and what is a whole? Can we define what these holons are? \n\nLet each Holons remind us that the impossible can always be made; let each one be nothing and everything — organisms, cosmos, energy itself — all at once, for it’s the creation of something entirely new that best reminds us that everything is actually made of the parts already here. So, remember to create without barriers or limitations because reality itself is made of that which lives now only in imagination.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x flight404\nOctober 2022\n\nPress ‘h’ in live view to render a high resolution version of any token.\nPress ‘s’ in live view to save a .png of the current view of any token.\n\nHolons was created in vanilla Javascript and WebGL, but the majority of the work was done in GLSL shaders. This setup was substantially assisted by fx(hash) community leader and artist Liam Egan who provided technical assistance and emotional support during the project's lifespan. For this reason, we have included him in the split of proceeds.\n",

While the palettes may not always reflect their trademark colors (if they even have any) they are an homage to individual pieces by the respective artists that have influenced this series in their own way.\n\n4878 bytes of Vanilla JS with no libraries.\n\nFor more info on the chosen palettes and other inspirations, see article linked from the main project page: Regarding Verdant Brut\n\nIn live mode:\n‘S’ : save as png (2376 × 3360)\n’V’ : save as svg (without grain)\n\nURL params in live mode:\n‘g=n’ : no grain\n‘g=p’ : paper grain\n‘h=t’ : high resolution mode, 5940 × 8400 (Chrome only)\n\nFor example, if you wanted paper grain in high resolution, append “&g=p&h=t” to the url in live mode.\n\nAfter rendering with these params, tapping 'P' will then save the png with those settings applied.",

            "description": "Energy is everywhere: it’s moving our bodies, buzzing around a city, growing the universe, and connecting everything within it. Perhaps the strongest symbol humans use for energy – for ideas, life, and the various incarnations of power – is light itself. \n\nFor centuries, each form of art has tried to capture the energetic luminescence of a bright light, a warm glow, a spark... if we could only draw with its pure brilliance! From Caravaggio’s diagonal beams, to Picasso drawing with light across Gjon Mili’s photographic emulsions… this pursuit persists through obsessive efforts by artists of every media. \n\na fortiori seeks to capture this power of light with code, output on the native illumination of modern screens. The visual deconstruction of light and its reassembly into a frozen moment produces the tangible shards of each spark – resulting in a sum of marks that exceeds the value of their individual parts. It’s then the obsessive energy of generative art’s looping and controlled randomness that enable its repeated mark making, of all types, to express the nearly-intangible intensity of light.\n\nWhat one hand might communicate in drawing, with light or stick or keyboard, 100 hands would therefore say 100 times louder, clearer, and more impactfully. And if one could capture the authentic energy of traveling light in a single image, it stands to reason that 500 of these images will multiply their energy-inducing qualities together, and exponentially grow their collective power. In this idea, the medium is the message – proving the power of the medium, and its ability to generate energy.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x Thomas Noya\nDecember 2022\n\nSource code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\na fortiori was created in p5.js and is optimized for live output in Chrome.

            "description": "The initial spark for this piece started with Armin Hofmann’s exercises in style and composition. Just as George Nelson wrote in the preface to Armin’s book Graphic Design Manual: Principles and Practices: \"Despite all our efforts to simplify things - efforts constantly expanding in order to keep abreast of steadily increasing complexity - nothing is very simple anymore\", these explorations just opened doors to other issues, and further grounded the idea that \"if problems can be correctly stated, they can be solved.\"\n\nArmin suggests we go back to the beginning, to concern ourselves with dots and circles and lines and then bring opposed components in confrontation. \"Confrontation is a theme on which variations can be played with any desired consonances, with any imaginable values, and in a great variety of ways. [...] (Only then) (s)he will be able to find creative solutions to the problems presented by the confrontation of opposites.\"\n\nVery quickly opposed components, even with extending the angle of vision from the two-dimensional surface to the three-dimensional space, and with the contrasts of thin-thick, solid-transparent, softened-hardened line, etc., started looking like I’m weaving complicated plots, visually similar to textile works by  Bauhaus women - Gunta Stölzl, Anni Albers, Gertrud Preiswerk and others.\n\nWhen Gropius founded the Bauhaus school in 1919, he proclaimed that “every eligible person whose talent and training are considered adequate will be accepted without regard to age and sex.” However, in practice, discriminatory gender roles were reinforced, and female students were guided and advised to work with textiles rather than in workshops for heavy crafts such as carpentry. Despite that, Gropius’s “women’s section” became one of its most collaborative and brave experimental sectors. \n\nA hundred years later, it is disappointing to see we still carry on with inherited gender roles. Check the number of female computer science students in your country. How are things going \"at the intersection of arts and technology\"? I've implemented some of the percentages from Serbia in the distribution of shapes in the final compositions. I sampled the number of female vs. male students at the Faculty of Mathematics and the University of Arts (where I studied and now work), and gender distribution among graduated students, and it didn't look bad at all. But then I realized I'm the only female professor (out of 5) teaching main subjects at doctoral studies program in digital arts.\n\n\"When a group is underrepresented, people come to take that underrepresentation as the norm.\" Since representation is imperative to achieving equality, it is equally critical to change the biases we’ve developed over centuries.\n\nFor the title, I chose a dated version of the word for a female weaver on purpose. My native language is one of the Slavic languages, which are all gender sensitive. It is natural to have feminitives, but since historically some occupations were less (or not at all) practiced by women, many of the feminitives for those professions, jobs, and specializations are rarely used or don't exist in the dictionary. Also, not surprisingly, the dominant version of the noun describing a person who weaves in Serbian would be the female noun \"tkalja\", whereas the male version is so rare that is missing from some dictionaries. Conscientiously choosing the female version of the noun for the title, I position myself and this piece in the historical context with Bauhaus weveresses, contemporary language, and gender contexts, and finally in the curatorial context of the exhibition. \n\nCode Weaveresses is part of the FEMGEN exhibition curated by Micol Ap @verticalcrypoto in partnership with @RtClick_Save and @artblocks_io.\n",

Even though an object is out of sight, it can still be remembered in mind via creative processes. \n\nWhen stimuli are spatially and temporally adjacent to one another, they may aggregate perceptually into prominent, coherent patterns or wholes. Our perceptual world is full of what we call a \"gestalt, such as when leaves and branches group together to form trees and when trees combine to form forests; when eyes, ears, noses, and mouths arrange themselves into faces; when musical notes combine to form chords and melodies; and when countless dots or pixels come together to form a photograph. Our project is, in a sense challenge of perception, so what do you see? What comes into your mind as a perception when you look at it ??\n\nWait a moment it takes a while to be rendered\n---\nCreated using vanilla javascript\nKrouniHatim - Nov22\n---\n(CC BY-ND 4.0)",

            "description": "Energy is everywhere: it’s moving our bodies, buzzing around a city, growing the universe, and connecting everything within it. Perhaps the strongest symbol humans use for energy – for ideas, life, and the various incarnations of power – is light itself. \n\nFor centuries, each form of art has tried to capture the energetic luminescence of a bright light, a warm glow, a spark... if we could only draw with its pure brilliance! From Caravaggio’s diagonal beams, to Picasso drawing with light across Gjon Mili’s photographic emulsions… this pursuit persists through obsessive efforts by artists of every media. \n\na fortiori seeks to capture this power of light with code, output on the native illumination of modern screens. The visual deconstruction of light and its reassembly into a frozen moment produces the tangible shards of each spark – resulting in a sum of marks that exceeds the value of their individual parts. It’s then the obsessive energy of generative art’s looping and controlled randomness that enable its repeated mark making, of all types, to express the nearly-intangible intensity of light.\n\nWhat one hand might communicate in drawing, with light or stick or keyboard, 100 hands would therefore say 100 times louder, clearer, and more impactfully. And if one could capture the authentic energy of traveling light in a single image, it stands to reason that 500 of these images will multiply their energy-inducing qualities together, and exponentially grow their collective power. In this idea, the medium is the message – proving the power of the medium, and its ability to generate energy.\n\n\n--------\n\nTENDER x Thomas Noya\nDecember 2022\n\nSource code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\na fortiori was created in p5.js and is optimized for live output in Chrome.

The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature. Brought into existence via the blockchain, it is a new form of “token word poetry.”\n\n\nAs with the duo’s other poetry “unreadings,” all minters will receive an airdropped broadside of the full poem after all editions are collected. A 1/1 media-rich version of the entire poem will also be made available. \n \nPoetic traits:\n- 321 editions performed by the algorithm, out of billions of possible combinations\n- Each unique piece contains between 3 and 6 (out of 60) lines of generative text from a poem by Technelegy – a custom text generator fine-tuned on Stiles’ writing and research material, seeded with prompts from Stiles’ and Stern’s work – translated into binary and performed by Stiles\n- 24 possible binary backbeats performed by Stern in his “Nathaniel Fun Time” (NFT) stylings, and generatively re-mixed\n- 98 possible intros\n- 15 musical stems composed by Kris Bones, generating millions of possible mixes\n- Thousands of possible ending combinations \n- 5 fonts, layered in billions of potential ways, including Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer”\n- 13 color palettes based on Stern and Stiles’ respective artworka\n- Very rare attributes including music-less performance, poem-less music, repeated “B1nary 0de” (title only)\n\nClick to start and stop or replay. Although the first play through will be the same every time, starting and stopping may create minor variations in your mix (though not any of the core attributes).\n\n0RAL B1NARY: “BINARY ODE” was produced with partial support from Refraction DAO’s Creative Grants program, and premiered as part of Refraction Festival at Art Basel Miami 2022. 15% of primary sales go to Refraction, and 5% of primary sales will be donated to Black Girls Code.\n",

            "description": "\"Stepping Stones\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Performance in Code: Deciphering Value in Generative Art, Art Basel Miami Beach, 2022\n\nStepping Stones explores the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Simple patterns, shapes, textures, and colors are arranged in randomly selected ways. Overlaying shapes distort and blend, breaking these objects apart and causing complex forms to emerge. Combining these individual features together results in varying outcomes, from surprisingly simple to wildly chaotic.\n\n---------------\n\nControls:\nPress 1-6 to change the scale of the canvas (1 = default, 2500px x 2500px, 6 = 15,000px x 15,000px)\nS (or double tap on mobile): Save output at current size\nC: Toggle cutout shapes visibility\nH: Toggle cutout outlines visibility\nB: Iterate border sizes (none, default, 1.5x, 2x, 3x)\nT: Toggle texture visibility\nF: Toggle fullscreen\nAdd the url params x and y to set custom dimensions. For example, add &x=1500&y=500 for a 1500px x 500px image\n\n---------------\n\nTyler Boswell (@teaboswell) 2022\nCC BY-NC-ND 4.0, See bundle.js.LICENSE.txt for third party license information",

They are found in Spain, the American Southwest, and northern Mexico, where they are essential for sustaining fields, orchards, and gardens in semi-arid regions.   \nOur aim in this series is to capture the essence of these waterways in bold geometric designs. Each piece is inspired by a mountain village or town in Andalusia (southern Spain). \n\nThe location determines the cube designs and construction rules that are used to build the final output. These are combined with striking day/night palettes, outline styles, scales, climates, and a few surprises of course!\n\n\nControls (in live view): \n\n- Press [p] to pause water animation \n- Press [e] to complete water animation \n- Press [r] to reset water animation \n- Press [s] to save the current image \n- Press [h] for a high-res output suitable for printing \n- Press [b] to toggle the border",
