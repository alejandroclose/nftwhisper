            "description": "At the heart of the borders of imagination stands my creation, \"Fata Morgana.\" \nThis abstract work is a bold exploration of the boundaries between reality and dream, a subtle dance between dimensions of perception. \nI forged this vision by giving life to a structure that eludes the human eye like a mirage in a scorching desert.\n\nFrom a distance, this creation draws the observer into a world that merges and blends with reality. The structures emerge as promises of urban architecture, but as they approach, they crumble into patterns of light and color.\n\nColors harmoniously dance, gently fading through ethereal shades. The forms themselves seem to reject definition, refusing to adhere to the laws of perspective and geometry.\n\nThe backdrop of this illusory city is a palette of chromatic emotions. Here, the boundary between the real and unreal completely dissolves, and one finds themselves wandering in a limbo of perceptions, suspended between certainty and wonder.\n\nThe artwork is an invitation to explore the unknown, a celebration of the art of illusion. It is a place where the rules of physics give way to the uninterrupted dance of creativity. In this abstract vision, I hope that everyone can find their own interpretation, a personal meaning that reveals itself like a secret guarded among the nuances of light and shadow.\n\nTo change the density from 1 to 5 (incorrect results set to 1), double-click the left mouse button,\npress S to delete background.\n\nI used p5.min.js - p5.sound.js.",

            "description": "Square Planets was inspired by a series of OP Art paintings done by Victor Vasarely, called Planetary Folklore Participations No. 2. (c. 1970). Vasarely died in 1997 in the early days of computer art. I'm sure he would have embraced this medium. This is the third in a series of Vasarely inspired Generative Art pieces I am offering.\n\nI became interested in Victor Vasarely's graphic artworks while I was in art school. As I struggled to learn computer graphics I wondered how do I write a program to produce imagery with a similar aesthetic? I call the process of creating algorithms inspired by other artists: \"Art\"ificial Intelligence.\n\nSquare Planets consists of four layers of squares contained within a background square superimposed on top of one another. Each layer is translated from the previous layer but still lies within its boundaries. The background color of each layer is random and its set of squares are another random color. The squares that make up layers two and three are rotated either clockwise or counter-clockwise some random number of degrees within a predetermined range. \n\nThere are many Gestalt interactions within this piece. Layers (square planets) interact with each other in interesting ways. Each new generation with its random color assignments significantly affect your depth perception. Layers appear to come forward or recede. Sometimes there is more \"after-imagism\" between the square sets. Candy for your mind.",

            "description": "Organic Illusion is one of the very first computer graphic drawings I produced that I considered worthy of being called Art. This version is a Plotter Art reconstruction of one of my classics.\n\nBetween 1973 - 1975 I was working on an MFA in Graphic Design at Michigan State University. I was using the most rudimentary hardware and software. All graphics were produced by writing code in FORTRAN, punching each line of code into a Hollerith card, assembling cards into a deck and submitting the deck for processing on a main frame at a central computing facility. You returned the next day to pick up your plot which was processed over night on an off-line plotter. I exhibited this piece in my MFA show in 1975.\n\nBack then the only \"graphic primitive\" we had available to create a drawing was the command to move a pen and draw a line: CALL PLOT(X, Y, penUp) and CALL PLOT(X, Y, penDown). Organic Illusion is an early example of an algorithmic image (non representational/non digitized) employing controlled randomness. It is a regular grid of square tiles that connect. Each tile consists of a square with its perimeter divided into the same number of points as the circle it contains. Randomness determines the placement of the circles’ center relative to the center of the square. The way the coordinate points between the two shapes are connected appear to create a volume, i.e. 3D illusion. \n\nThe code for the original image is long gone but I was able to reconstruct it from memory. Like a child you never forget. I submit to you again in new media for you all to enjoy.\n\nCheck out Dr. Bill Generative Art OG website @ drbillkolomyjec.com",

            "description": "Through seemingly random brushstrokes and trial and error, a painting emerges. With each layer added, objects come to life. The painter takes their time to contemplate each new layer, infusing thought and intention into the artwork. Can my code teach me painting? Can I learn something by looking at the process of drawing? At the end of the day, it is I who made it paint, so why can't I?\n\nTech Note:\nThe artwork is extremely CPU-intensive and may take up to 2 minutes to fully render. The indicator in the bottom right corner provides information on the current process: \"marching\" - the algorithm generates new layers of squares by raymarching the terrain and evaluating color at the corners; \"drawing\" - random brush strokes are being applied to the canvas.\n\nControls:\n1 - Press \"S\" to save the image.\n2 - Press \"R\" to adjust the resolution.\n\nThe code has been tested on my old MacBook and various Windows machines. For the best results, please use a modern Chromium-based browser.\n\nsuperbialux",

            "description": "This project is based on a system of thresholds and minimum distances to create shapes. The sketch is populated with random points at its start, including completely random points and others that form the four corners of the cells of one or more (modular) grids.\n\nOnce all these points are placed, the program selects the closest ones to each other in groups of 3 to 5, based on a minimum distance. These polygons will later be filled with hatching.\n\nOnce the program has determined a certain number of groups/polygons, it will use a slightly higher threshold than the first one to connect points between the different polygons (lighter color).\n\nA third threshold comes into play, allowing the selection of points closer to the edges of the composition. The program will draw lines from these points to connect them to the boundaries of the composition.\n\n---\n\n\nPNG & SVG\n\nBy clicking in the composition (in live mode), two buttons should be displayed to obtain a PNG or SVG. You can also use the [d] key for PNG and the [p] key for SVG.\n\n---\n\n\nPlotting suspended\n\nYou can plot your output with your own plotter. The SVG is optimized for Inkscape, and contains two layers for each of the colors in the composition. Because of the large number of lines Suspended polygons can contain, I recommend that you set the \"plot optimization\" option to \"Full; Also allow path reversal\", otherwise you risk damaging the paper.\n\n---\n\n\nCreated with typescript\nNicolas Lebrun @nclslbrn nicolas-lebrun.fr",
