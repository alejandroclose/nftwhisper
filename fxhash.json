            "description": "The preparations for the first mission began in 2142. It had become clear that mining petroleum on Earth would soon become financially unfeasible, so looking to other planets was the only logical choice. It took seventeen more years to perfect the technology so that the first colonists could reach Proxima b within the lifetime of one generation.\n\nAfter 45 years of travelling at almost one-tenth of the speed of light, they reached their new home. It was rich in petrochemicals but scarce in the nutrients necessary for long term human survival. After merely six generations, humanity was forced to travel once again in search of a new world. The four missions that parted from the Proxima system to colonise other possibly habitable planets in the galaxy sparked a new age of human civilisation that would never see itself united and thriving again.\n\nEventually, all the colonies became independent societies as their differing interests drove them apart. Each small civilisation chose its path, wandering the void of space alone. Over time, millions of kilometres apart, each colony developed its own culture and traditions. While their habits and customs changed, some things remained the same across all the societies, like how it became a certain tradition to convert the outer world years and days to Earth time and celebrate holidays according to the calendar of the old world.\n\nThe new nomads learned from the first pilgrims. They used the technology once optimised for oil extraction to traverse other worlds, searching for sustenance. Peculiar wandering nonspaces emerged from the involuntary degrowth of human civilisation.\n\n-----\n\nClick on the image to open the menu.

But why do so much awful things still exist? Well, there are many possiblities:\n - The problem is profitable for those who are working on the solution, thus in reality they would never want to solve it\n - The problem doesn't exist, it's either made up or misinterpreted\n - Fixing the problem would inflict more harm than good\n - The solution wasn't found yet\n - The solution isn't what was expected, thus it's being denied",

The more a garden manages to sharpen all the senses, the better it fulfills its role.\nThe challenge of this project is to provide as many sensations as possible, some you will get visually and others you will need imagination. Imagination is an essential part of this project. There are different species from different cultures that, after becoming relatives, start to interact with each other.\n\nThe Garden of Imagination is layered artwork generated from a pool of previously rendered digital assets developed for several months.\n\n- Use the \"S\" key to export an image.\n",

            "description": "Tumble Down Light Factory is an interpretation of light installations & murals.\n\nIt attempts to trigger the feeling of coming up on a new block in a new city to discover an unexpected piece of art that is stories tall or entering a new room, knowing there will be a projection dominating the space with its light and color.\n\nThis is an abstract distillation of those things and those feelings.\n\nEach composition is initially drawn to a hidden “template” canvas which is sampled and then rendered on the main canvas in various ways after applying some transforms to give it some depth (and so you can actually see it.)\n\nViewing in full-screen is nice. You should try it.\n\nT : Save hidden ‘template’ image\nS : Save current resolution\n1 -> 5 : Save low -> high resolution\n",
