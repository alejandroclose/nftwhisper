This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.\n\nMy deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.\n\nAn algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.\n\nNavigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. \n\nAnd lastly, a heartfelt dedication. Through every line of code, every algorithm tweak, she remained my rock. Alice, as you embrace another year, this piece is not just an ode to my creative journey but also a heartfelt tribute to you, my biggest supporter since the outset. This project, and every beat of my heart, is for you. <3\n\n3500x4953px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

            "description": "This piece is a reflection of my passions, a blend of the visual and the auditory, and a testament to the power of interdisciplinary inspiration.\n\nAt the very core of 'Cable Management' lies the mesmerizing aura of 'Impressions of Order' by nbswwit. This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.\n\nMy deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.\n\nAn algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.\n\nNavigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. \n\nAnd lastly, a heartfelt dedication. Through every line of code, every algorithm tweak, she remained my rock. Alice, as you embrace another year, this piece is not just an ode to my creative journey but also a heartfelt tribute to you, my biggest supporter since the outset. This project, and every beat of my heart, is for you. <3\n\n3500x4953px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.\n\nMy deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.\n\nAn algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.\n\nNavigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. \n\nAnd lastly, a heartfelt dedication. Through every line of code, every algorithm tweak, she remained my rock.

This artwork changes to an expressionist version once the overshoot moment has passed, day by day.\n\nThis project closes the feedback loop between lifestyle and environmental impact. 10 countries are featured with their individual overshoot moment. In Australia, the resources are completely consumed at 5 am in the morning. In Thailand, the earth’s ecological limits are reached at about 4 pm. \n\nThe data is based on the Earth Overshoot Day which is hosted and calculated by Global Footprint Network, an international research organization.

            "description": "This piece is a reflection of my passions, a blend of the visual and the auditory, and a testament to the power of interdisciplinary inspiration.\n\nAt the very core of 'Cable Management' lies the mesmerizing aura of 'Impressions of Order' by nbswwit. This piece, woven with a rich tapestry of patterns, was a visual catalyst that nudged me towards another intriguing realm: Modular Synthesizers. While many associate these intricate machines with sound, I was drawn to their visual aspect. The maze of cables, the geometric alignment of modules, the unpredictability in their assembly - all of these became pivotal visual inspirations for both the aesthetics and the very name of my piece.\n\nMy deep-seated musical background has always been a reservoir of inspiration. But with 'Cable Management', my ambition was to transcend beyond the auditory. I sought not to directly incorporate sound but to let the principles of music shape the contours of my visual artwork. And in the layered structure of the artwork, I found an echo of the captivating world of polyrhythms. Just as these rhythms, when layered, weave an enchanting harmonic tapestry, the four layers in 'Cable Management', each scaling its own grid, come together to produce a visual rhythm that is both intricate and harmonious.\n\nAn algorithm, teetering with a chaos factor between 95% to 99%, was my experiment in dancing on the fine line between predictability and serendipity. It was a revelation, showcasing that even when one thinks they've charted every course, there's always room for a delightful surprise, for a twist in the tale.\n\nNavigating the oscillation between chaos and order has been a profound experience. The idea of staying unwaveringly committed to an initial vision, despite the whirlwind of creativity, feels like a cherished accomplishment. \n\nAnd lastly, a heartfelt dedication. Through every line of code, every algorithm tweak, she remained my rock. Alice, as you embrace another year, this piece is not just an ode to my creative journey but also a heartfelt tribute to you, my biggest supporter since the outset. This project, and every beat of my heart, is for you. <3\n\n3500x4953px\nPress [s] for .jpeg | Press [p] for .png\nMade with p5.js\n\nRob Scalera | 2023\n",

In this new piece, I expand on my initial inspirations of the early concrete poetry movement bringing in texts of my own. These short texts are taken from my extensive notes on the subject of artificial intelligence. Snippets of plausible pistes of reflection as well as lighter more tongue in cheek ideas make up the selection I have curated for the work.

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",
