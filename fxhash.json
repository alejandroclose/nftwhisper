Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "Orbit of Influence is part of the fxhash live minting experience at Proof of People, ZeroSpace NYC, 2023 and is a unique generative program created using processing's p5js and SVG. Developed from scratch, it employs a system of rule-based environments that have been a source of satisfaction for me since 1995.\n\nThe program generates three invisible planets, each at a different scale - small, medium, and large. Fifty objects then randomly select a planet, a speed to orbit around it, and one of three brush sizes - small, medium, or large. These objects move around their respective planets, painting color and texture across the planetary orbit in three-dimensional space.\n\nTo reveal the blueprint of the system, press the \"s\" key on your keyboard. The hidden algorithm that governs the brushes' movement is then displayed, revealing a mesmerizing display of synchronized choreography as the brushes interconnect with each other.\n\nPress the following keys to interact :\n\n- '1': swap the background color to \"ocean\"\n- '2': swap the background color to \"mist\"\n- '3': swap the background color to \"lilac\"\n- '4': swap the background color to \"amethyst\"\n- '5': swap the background color to \"crimson\"\n- '6': swap the background color to \"emerald\"\n\n- 'l': toggle animation loop on/off\n- 's': system reveal, show the blueprint of the algorithm\n\nJoshua Davis / PrayStation 'Orbit of Influence' / (2023) real-time generative program, 1240 x 1653 px, Date Minted: April 2023\n\nTwitter: @joshuadavis\nInstagram: @praystation\nWebsite: https://joshuadavis.com\n\nBio :\n\nSince 1995, Joshua Davis is an artist, technologist, author and designer in algorithmic image making & animation. Using programming, he writes his own code to produce interactions with users and to generate visual compositions according to rule-based, randomized processes.\n\nJoshua has exhibited his works and/or lectured at the Ars Electronica (Austria), Centre Georges Pompidou (France), Contemporary Arts Center (Cincinnati), J. Paul Getty Museum (Los Angeles),  the Tate Modern (London), the Design Museum (London), the Institute of Contemporary Arts (London), PS.1 MoMA (New York), the Whitney (New York), the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum (New York), the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (Spain), among others.\n\nSince 2000, Joshua has lectured globally about his work, inspirations and motivations at museums, galleries, institutions, art festivals, etc., and has spoken at the TED (2005) and 99U (2013) conferences about his career in algorithmic image making and open source.",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",

Developed from scratch, it employs a system of rule-based environments that have been a source of satisfaction for me since 1995.\n\nThe program generates three invisible planets, each at a different scale - small, medium, and large. Fifty objects then randomly select a planet, a speed to orbit around it, and one of three brush sizes - small, medium, or large. These objects move around their respective planets, painting color and texture across the planetary orbit in three-dimensional space.\n\nTo reveal the blueprint of the system, press the \"s\" key on your keyboard. The hidden algorithm that governs the brushes' movement is then displayed, revealing a mesmerizing display of synchronized choreography as the brushes interconnect with each other.\n\nPress the following keys to interact :\n\n- '1': swap the background color to \"ocean\"\n- '2': swap the background color to \"mist\"\n- '3': swap the background color to \"lilac\"\n- '4': swap the background color to \"amethyst\"\n- '5': swap the background color to \"crimson\"\n- '6': swap the background color to \"emerald\"\n\n- 'l': toggle animation loop on/off\n- 's': system reveal, show the blueprint of the algorithm\n\nJoshua Davis / PrayStation 'Orbit of Influence' / (2023) real-time generative program, 1240 x 1653 px, Date Minted: April 2023\n\nTwitter: @joshuadavis\nInstagram: @praystation\nWebsite: https://joshuadavis.com\n\nBio :\n\nSince 1995, Joshua Davis is an artist, technologist, author and designer in algorithmic image making & animation.

Ant colonies, mushrooms, and trees all follow basic principles, yet their resulting actions and growth patterns are fascinatingly intricate. For example, ants can exhibit intelligent collective behavior, fungi are highly successful organisms that make up a larger biomass than all animals combined, and each tree is unique.\n\nThese emergent properties arise from the environment in which these simple rules operate. A tree's growth is influenced by many factors such as soil, water, seasons, wind, humidity, light, and interactions with other plants and animals.\n\nThis series is a reflection on the beauty and uniqueness of each living thing, and how complexity emerges from simplicity.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts, we’ve used a custom variant of the \"reaction-diffusion\" algorithm, which approximates some biological systems. This algorithm was introduced by Alan Turing in 1952 in his paper titled \"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis.\" The rules are very simple but by changing the initial conditions and adding perturbations, we can reach very different visual outcomes.\n\nIn this way we create a dialog between the strict mathematical rules interpreted by the machine and the organic visuals that emerge from it.\n\n--------\n\nWarning: This piece is GPU intensive, it may not render on lower end devices.\n\nPress 'S' to save the image at the current scale\nPress 'H' to save the image at 2560px resolution\nPress 'P' to save the image at 3840px resolution\n\nCreated with Three.js\n\n--------\n\nWilliam Watkins\nApril 2023",

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",
