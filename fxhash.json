            "description": "Mecha-Bamboo is the second installment in the Mecha series, where I attempt to blend mechanical elements with nature.\n\nThe main building blocks used in this piece are metal pipes, nuts and bolts forming bamboo stems and mending plates extending outwards with sharp metal scraps at their ends resembling branches and leaves. \n\nThere are 4 main arrangement variations \n\t- Two abstract variations with the metal bamboos growing out of the sides and border (20% chance each)\n\t- Two landscape arrangements, one on flat planes and the other on floating platforms.  (30% chance each)\n\nThe dominant stroke and fill colors are chosen at random from the RGB color space and are only recomputed if certain contrast criteria aren't fulfilled. \nIn combination with one of 10 hand-selected color palettes used for accents, this allows a great variation of different possible color schemes.\n\nThe structure and appearance of the bamboo, its stems and leaves are controlled by over 50 parameters that are chosen at random, giving each iteration a unique style.\n\n\n\nKeys: \nS - Save PNG image\nV - Open SVG Export menu\nSpace - Pause\n\nPlotting:\nYou can export a plottable SVG of each iteration by opening the export menu. I plot these on A3 with a 0.1mm fineliner. But depending on the density of the iteration other choices might be better suited. \n\n\nThe image is generated entirely in Javascript and the postprocessing is done with a custom shader. If there is no webgl support, the image will render without any postprocessing. You can force this by appending the URL parameter \"?noWebgl=1\".\n\nLibraries used:\nThree.js & EffectComposer\nJavascript-Voronoi by gorhill\nperlin.js by  Joseph Gentle\ndat.gui",

            "description": "Nested identities redact fingerprints but deeper meaning can still be found.\n\nNested identifies refers to the idea that a person may have multiple identities that are interconnected and interdependent. These identities may be related to a person's cultural background, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, social class, profession, and other factors. It is possible that a person may want to conceal or redact certain aspects of their identity in order to protect their privacy or to avoid discrimination or persecution. However, even if certain details about a person's identity are hidden or redacted, it may still be possible to infer deeper meaning or understand more about their experiences and perspectives based on the context in which they express themselves and the information that is available.\n\n\nThe concept of nested identities highlights the complexity and multifaceted nature of a person's identity, and how different aspects of identity can intersect and influence each other. It is important to recognize and respect the diversity of identities that people may hold, and to be mindful of the ways in which power dynamics and social context can shape how people present and express their identities. It is also important to recognize that people's identities may evolve and change over time, and that everyone has the right to self-identify and to define their own identity on their own terms.\n\nPress p to download a high quality export.",

            "description": "Mecha-Bamboo is the second installment in the Mecha series, where I attempt to blend mechanical elements with nature.\n\nThe main building blocks used in this piece are metal pipes, nuts and bolts forming bamboo stems and mending plates extending outwards with sharp metal scraps at their ends resembling branches and leaves. \n\nThere are 4 main arrangement variations \n\t- Two abstract variations with the metal bamboos growing out of the sides and border (20% chance each)\n\t- Two landscape arrangements, one on flat planes and the other on floating platforms.  (30% chance each)\n\nThe dominant stroke and fill colors are chosen at random from the RGB color space and are only recomputed if certain contrast criteria aren't fulfilled. \nIn combination with one of 10 hand-selected color palettes used for accents, this allows a great variation of different possible color schemes.\n\nThe structure and appearance of the bamboo, its stems and leaves are controlled by over 50 parameters that are chosen at random, giving each iteration a unique style.\n\n\n\nKeys: \nS - Save PNG image\nV - Open SVG Export menu\nSpace - Pause\n\nPlotting:\nYou can export a plottable SVG of each iteration by opening the export menu. I plot these on A3 with a 0.1mm fineliner. But depending on the density of the iteration other choices might be better suited. \n\n\nThe image is generated entirely in Javascript and the postprocessing is done with a custom shader. If there is no webgl support, the image will render without any postprocessing. You can force this by appending the URL parameter \"?noWebgl=1\".\n\nLibraries used:\nThree.js & EffectComposer\nJavascript-Voronoi by gorhill\nperlin.js by  Joseph Gentle\ndat.gui",

            "description": "Mecha-Bamboo is the second installment in the Mecha series, where I attempt to blend mechanical elements with nature.\n\nThe main building blocks used in this piece are metal pipes, nuts and bolts forming bamboo stems and mending plates extending outwards with sharp metal scraps at their ends resembling branches and leaves. \n\nThere are 4 main arrangement variations \n\t- Two abstract variations with the metal bamboos growing out of the sides and border (20% chance each)\n\t- Two landscape arrangements, one on flat planes and the other on floating platforms.  (30% chance each)\n\nThe dominant stroke and fill colors are chosen at random from the RGB color space and are only recomputed if certain contrast criteria aren't fulfilled. \nIn combination with one of 10 hand-selected color palettes used for accents, this allows a great variation of different possible color schemes.\n\nThe structure and appearance of the bamboo, its stems and leaves are controlled by over 50 parameters that are chosen at random, giving each iteration a unique style.\n\n\n\nKeys: \nS - Save PNG image\nV - Open SVG Export menu\nSpace - Pause\n\nPlotting:\nYou can export a plottable SVG of each iteration by opening the export menu. I plot these on A3 with a 0.1mm fineliner. But depending on the density of the iteration other choices might be better suited. \n\n\nThe image is generated entirely in Javascript and the postprocessing is done with a custom shader. If there is no webgl support, the image will render without any postprocessing. You can force this by appending the URL parameter \"?noWebgl=1\".\n\nLibraries used:\nThree.js & EffectComposer\nJavascript-Voronoi by gorhill\nperlin.js by  Joseph Gentle\ndat.gui",
