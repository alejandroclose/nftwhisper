            "description": "“Pigments” is a generative art project that explores the beauty of optical color blending and the power of noise. \n\nAt the heart of this work is a random composition of rectangles that are made up of dots. These pigments are arranged in multiple layers, each layer using a different color from one of the carefully curated color palettes. Each palette consists of three to five colors. \n\nAs the pigments are shifted by random noise, new hues and patterns emerge, creating a lovely display of color and movement.\n\nIn live mode:\n- Press [1]-[5] to change the resolution.\n- Press [s] to save a png file at the current resolution.\n\nThis is my first generative art project. Created with p5js.\n\n________\n\nLooks best on high-resolution screens and viewed in live mode. When displayed on a low-resolution screen, an unintended moiré pattern may appear.",

            "description": "Hus is a temporal generative art data visualization about care work and gender. Each variation of the work provides a unique perspective of the gender gap in care work within Danish society. Utilizing time and movement as a visualizer technique, the underlying data set is meant to be  understood by the spectator through prolonged exposure to the work. \n\nHus changes its expression over a 24 hour cycle to visualize how care work can be understood to be split between men, women and queer people in Danish society. Each of the three main colors in Hus correspond to a different group of people. Each group has different movements, corresponding to how the data shows that they approach care work. \n\nThe data comes from the report “Hvordan bruger danskerne tiden?” from 2018 by Rockwool Fonden. The report does not include data for queer people, and they are therefore included as a separate group with a somewhat random pattern of movements to emphasize the lack of representation in research. \n\nHus is released in collaboration with OFFICE IMPART as part of Node — a platform to explore the Boundaries of Digital Art. \n\n· Interactions ·\n\nPressing the following keys will trigger functionality. Some of them also add related URL parameters.\n\nPressing I will save the piece as an image. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nPressing V will start recording a video. Pressing it again will stop recording and save the video. Only works outside of iframe.\n\nPressing C will cycle through the color schemes.\n\nPressing F will toggle between fast forwarding the animation.\n\nPressing A will toggle between autoplay mode.\n\nPressing U will toggle full screen mode.\n\nPressing T will toggle between freezing Hus in current time.\n\nPressing N will show a new random variation and clear the URL parameters.\n\n· URL parameters ·\n\nYou can add the following parameters to the URL to change the behavior of the piece.\n\nimage=true — Save the piece as an image on page load.\n\ncolor=<number> — See the piece in another color scheme. The numbers loop around, so 12 equals 0, 13 equals 1, etc.\n\nfastforward=true — Start Hus in fast forward mode.\n\nautoplay=true — Run autoplay mode which cycles through new variations every minute.\n\nfullscreen=true — Start Hus in fullscreen mode.\n\ntime=<HH:MM:SS> — See how Hus looks at a specific time of day. Use the format HH:MM:SS.\n\n· Accessibility ·\n\nHus is built to support screen readers. It has been tested using MacOS’ VoiceOver, and uses custom code to provide screen reader functionality.\n\nWhen saving an image, Hus produces an image description that can be used when sharing on social media to improve accessibility. \n\nIf you have any comments (good or bad) on the screen reader integration, don’t hesitate to reach out.\n\n· Credits and license ·\n\nHus is made with Three.js.\n\nHus is licensed under a modified version of the Climate Strike License (CSL).",

            "description": "# What is this?\n\nThis is 6942 characters of highly experimental code.\n\nThis is a version of my rayhatcher framework (see https://www.fxhash.xyz/article/rayhatching-evolution) that can do literally everything. Or, at least anything you can do within 512 characters of Javascript code. Which is slightly more than a mortal brain can comprehend.\n\nThis is my answer to the question: What is the least restrictive set of parameters for fx(params)?\n\n# Should I be minting this?\n\nDepends if you know and like building SDF formulas. Otherwise probably not. Like I said, this is highly experimental code. But it's definitely worth checking the collection and/or secondary for cool stuff that is already minted.\n\n# How does it work?\n\nThe minter designs an SDF (Signed Distance Function) which is rendered using my rayhatcher algorithm. They then use the SDF formula in the SDF Code parameter. It's not very complicated, just efficient.\n\nYou can press \"h\" to load the documentation and read about how everything works. Or you can press \"d\" to read the dev docs. \n\n# Anything else?\n\nDon't forget that the \"Title Seed\" param also becomes the \"Title\" feature of the mint, so make it count.\n\nThe params, including the SDF code actually get saved on-chain. Even better, all params and the entire code required to reproduce the image are included in the SVG when saved.

            "description": "\"Dreamcatcher Forest\" is part of the fxhash interactive minting experience at Art Basel, Basel 2022. The illustration in this work draws inspiration from Native American dreamcatchers, a protective talisman crafted from beautifully intricate patterns of woven thread, built from natural materials & colorful beads.\n\nDreamcatchers are used to protect dreamers while they sleep. Good dreams are able to slip through the web to meet the sleeper beneath, while bad dreams are trapped and prevented.\n\n- Use the \"S\" key to save a PNG image.\n- Use the \"P\" key to export a print-quality image.",

            "description": "This work alludes to the need for rethinking our dependencies on primary sense faculties. In recent times we have seen with the explosion of web3, we are blinded by beautiful visuals so much that we are not able to see anything else anymore. Can beauty be described, or felt, or touched, can it touch us in that process? These were some of the questions that resulted in giving direction to this work, where the challenge was to create a simple landscape using descriptive labels, so that the landscape might be seen in a different light.\n\nAlso over the years having worked with differently abled people, the motivation also was to create a work that is inclusive and the beauty of a visual that can be enjoyed by everyone. With this in mind, I tried to create this work that uses the p5.js accessibility library, so that a description of the visual can be read by a screen reader.\n\nPressing '1' generates a text output of the visual the can be read by the screen reader, and 's' saves the current image. \n\nI had a few challenges in using the accessibility package, and had to resort to a basic version of the work to make the library usable for me, and much needs to be done in terms of it being user friendly for the general public. To that effect, 50% of the sales from the work will be donated to The Processing Foundation, to help with developing the accessibility library further. Also 66.66 % of the royalties will be perpetually split between The Processing Foundation and the first minter.\n",

            "description": "This work alludes to the need for rethinking our dependencies on primary sense faculties. In recent times we have seen with the explosion of web3, we are blinded by beautiful visuals so much that we are not able to see anything else anymore. Can beauty be described, or felt, or touched, can it touch us in that process? These were some of the questions that resulted in giving direction to this work, where the challenge was to create a simple landscape using descriptive labels, so that the landscape might be seen in a different light.\n\nAlso over the years having worked with differently abled people, the motivation also was to create a work that is inclusive and the beauty of a visual that can be enjoyed by everyone. With this in mind, I tried to create this work that uses the p5.js accessibility library, so that a description of the visual can be read by a screen reader.\n\nPressing '1' generates a text output of the visual the can be read by the screen reader, and 's' saves the current image. \n\nI had a few challenges in using the accessibility package, and had to resort to a basic version of the work to make the library usable for me, and much needs to be done in terms of it being user friendly for the general public. To that effect, 50% of the sales from the work will be donated to The Processing Foundation, to help with developing the accessibility library further. Also 66.66 % of the royalties will be perpetually split between The Processing Foundation and the first minter.\n",

Each stroke, meticulously generated through code, is more than a pixel on a screen; it's a testament to the painstaking process of its creation and to my inner struggle.\n\nDuring a period of creative drought, I found myself grappling with the vast canvas of my imagination, striving to bring forth ideas that stubbornly lingered beneath the surface. The struggle to birth a new masterpiece mirrored the blank canvas before me, a formidable opponent that reflected my creative void.\n\nEmerging from this struggle is the painting itself, a testament to my evolution. Each flower, resplendent in its multi-hued glory, signifies an idea that eventually bloomed in the arid landscape of my imagination. They are not just flowers, but symbols of triumph over artistic adversity, each one born of relentless determination, countless hours, and a deep-seated resolve.\n\nThe bouquet is a symphony of colors, textures, and shapes, with each tiny stroke having its own purpose, its own identity. Together, these strokes bring forth a visual effect reminiscent of Impasto Oil Painting, offering a sense of depth and volume, a tactile quality that seems to lift the flowers off the canvas. Each one was placed carefully, deliberately, with precision guided by complex algorithms and a vision of the bigger picture they were part of.\n\nThe vase, a beacon of silver and gray amidst the riotous bloom, represents me. It is the vessel that contains and supports the bouquet, much like how I channel my creativity into a myriad of ideas, each one blooming into an individual stroke on the canvas.\n\nThis painting serves as a reminder that the creation of something beautiful and meaningful often starts small. The blooming flowers did not appear overnight. They are the result of thousands of tiny strokes, each one placed carefully, deliberately, and with a firm belief in the bigger picture they were part of.\n\nIn essence, the vase of flowers is not just a painting, but a story - my story - of struggle, perseverance, and the power of tiny, incremental steps towards a grand vision. It is a testament to the fact that great things often start small, and in the end, every stroke counts.\n\nArtist's Note:\n\nPlease be aware that due to the complexity and depth of the layers of shaders involved in creating the \"Flowers of Progress\", the artwork might take a bit of time to load or may not work on some devices.

            "description": "As a fundamental element derived from organic matter, charcoal happens to be at the core of all life forms. It is also the tool for artists that dates back to the most ancient times. \nBy using charcoal as the the primary medium for the exhibition ‘Organic Matr’ (and resulting series of physical pieces created in collaboration with Brooklyn-based lab ArtMatr), the works creates bonds between technology and the rawest tool that was touched by the human hand, and highlights how the cycle of life is also the cycle of regeneration of matter.\n\nSince the generative process _that uses programming code and the intervention of randomness_ was used to design the physical pieces, the long-form generative series Charcoal Seeds is a natural way to seamlessly extend back into the digital realm the ideas of matter and physicality, while showing the elements at work in the creation process. \nIn each iteration a virtual seed will encapsulates the essence of organic forms and patterns. The graphic style itself tries to convey the organic feeling of tools and materials such as chalk, ink, paintbrushes. \n\n\n—— \n\n- \"Charcoal Seeds\" offers a WYSIWYG experience : by deriving the randomness from the minter’s wallet address, it is guaranteed that what you see onscreen after adjusting the params will be your actual NFT. \nHowever, we wanted to allow the possibility of getting some rare features. By selecting \"random\" for the Format or the Paper color, you will get a chance to mint a Pink or a Back background, or have a Wide Landscape format. Beware : this will break the WYSIWYG ( but it will keep your params settings safe ) \n\n- As usual, the project is plottable : press [s] in live mode to generate a SVG file suited for pen plotters.\n\n- By adding a ‘scale’ parameter in the live URL, you can generate a higher resolution image. The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with a default value of 3. \n",
