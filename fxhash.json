            "description": "After 4 months of coding the Generative Glasses is ready! I gained a lot of experience along the way and I really liked the creation process.\n\nI wrote an article in which I report on the creation process in more detail. It can be found at the bottom of the page for related articles.\n\nüëì thousands of different outputs are possible\nüë®‚Äçüíª only code\nüé® 3D (#webGL #threejs) and 2D (#html5canvas) layers \nüé• animated\nüñ±Ô∏è interactive (+controls for mobile)\nüòé augmented reality view\nüü• different previews: abstract view, product design view, and 2 other view\nüñºÔ∏è save images from current view in 4k - 3 different aspect ratio\nüìº save animation (from server side) on http://carco.hu\n\nCompositions:\n\n- There is an abstract view where the parts of the glasses are scattered\n- There is a front-right view\n- Front-left view\n- Top view\n- Product design view that converts to split screen\n- Front view where the object falls apart and starts from the abstract view again\n\nFirst, one of the 6 compositions comes in and the animation starts. The system randomly determines which composition should be the first in the line. This will also be the saved image that the fxhash system creates. \n\nIf you don't click or touch anything, the animation will loop continuously. If you click into the area anywhere, the controller will appear and the animation will stop. Until you get to the next composition and the animation stops, the pause button flashes until now you can't press anything, all buttons are disabled. If the animation has stopped, the buttons are enabled again, and you can move the camera in 3D space by dragging. \n\nThe controls have left and right arrows that can be used to step between compositions. The animation restarts with the play button.\n\nThere are also a few other buttons:\n\n- There is a save button which is a floppy disk. A menu will then appear, offering to save images of different proportions, with the default aspect ratio generated by the program code at the top. (Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\n- There is a camera icon that restores the original camera view. It is worth pressing this before saving.\n\nThere are options that are not available for all compositions, they only appear if they are enabled in current composition:\n\n- Switch split screen to main camera view, and back (4 squares icon)\n- Shows and hide Editing lines (pair of compasses)\n- Shows and hide Callout notations (pencil and ruler)\n- Shows AR view and stop it (cube icon) (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nKeyboard controls:\n\nPress ‚Äú5‚Äù to save image to default aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú6‚Äù to save image to square aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú7‚Äù to save image to portrait aspect ratio\nPress ‚Äú8‚Äù to save image to landscape aspect ratio\n\n(Opening in a new window is required to save an image)\n\nPress ‚ÄúArrowDown‚Äù for restores the original camera view\nPress ‚ÄúD‚Äù to switch to next composition\nPress ‚ÄúA‚Äù to switch  to previous composition\nPress ‚ÄúS‚Äù to start animation\nPress ‚ÄúSpacebar‚Äù to switch to split screen (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú1‚Äù to hide/show Editing lines (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú2‚Äù to hide/show Callout notations (if it is available)\nPress ‚Äú3‚Äù to hide/show AR view (Opening in a new window is required to AR view, more info below)\n\nAR view\n\nIf you have a camera on your device, you can try out how such glasses would suit you. This function is not available for all compositions, so if you cannot find the cube icon, tab to the next composition and click on the cube icon. I created this function with the help of Tensorflow face landmark detection package. It's not perfect, there are delays, but it's good enough to try out the glasses.\n\nMore information on how were made Generative Glasses in the related article below.\n\nThank you for your attention! Thanks for the support! Thanks for the opportunity fxhash and genart community! I hope I was able to contribute to generative art with my work!\n\n@C4RC0\ncarco.hu",

The compositions that emerge may be harmonious or asynchronous, comforting or jarring, wistful, mysterious, subtle, or bold.\n\nThe piece is generated as follows:\n\nFirst, borders and columns are defined. The canvas may have one or two borders, ranging from small to large, and the inner border may or may not have a coloured edge and fill.

The compositions that emerge may be harmonious or asynchronous, comforting or jarring, wistful, mysterious, subtle, or bold.\n\nThe piece is generated as follows:\n\nFirst, borders and columns are defined. The canvas may have one or two borders, ranging from small to large, and the inner border may or may not have a coloured edge and fill. If they are not coloured, the feature \"Hidden Background\" will be true. Each column is assigned three colours at random from one of several possible colour palettes. The top and bottom boundaries of each column are set, and in some iterations, there is a chance that columns will break outside the border boundaries.\n\nAs columns are drawn from top to bottom, there are several events that may occur with probabilities pre-defined for each iteration: 1) The stroke colour may switch abruptly or over a gradient between two of the three column colours. 2) A 'repeater' pattern may be triggered, where two of the column colours alternate with a given frequency and rate of decay. 3) Single 'accent' bands may occur with the third column colour. 4) 'Bulges' may form with either rectangle, diamond, sin wave, or 'skirt' shapes.\n\nThere may also be horizontal bands that span the entire image, with a certain variability of height across columns.\n\nStrokes may be straight lines or Bezier curves. Bezier curves may be uniform for an iteration, where the control points of the curves are generated from a single formula for the whole image, or they may be random.

            "description": "Welcome to the ultimate pico_punk generator! This interactive token is a parameter based generator that creates unique pico_punk generators. Each one will generate one pico_punk with a number of layers chosen by you during the parameter selection phase. Additionally, you can use the buttons to navigate the generative space, and create your own pico_punks via an interactive process of discovery. This is the final pico_punk generator I intend to make, with the extra capabilities added by the parameter selection process, and the final tweaks and changes I made to the appearances and effects, I think this project is now as complete as I can ever make it.\n\nThe controls:\n- arrow keys: move through the generative space... each step adds one layer to the composition\n- x button: take a screenshot of the generated pico_punk\n- o button: clear all layers except the current one (clean slate for building a new pico_punk)\n\nEach layer has a chance to apply one of various visual effects, which vary in how transformative (or disruptive) they are.\n\n\npico_punks began as a project to create something akin to DOS Punks, but fully generative, without any manual intervention or pre-rendered components, using only the Pico-8 Fantasy Console. You can find the first generator here: (https://objkt.com/asset/hicetnunc/439049). In this early version, the generator was interactive, but each pico_punk was totally isolated, being generated from one unique seed and one consistent process. Over time, this evolved to this final experience: one in which the \"curator\", the user exploring the generator, is not just choosing from an infinite number of punks, but actually the process of exploration itself is modifying the output before your eyes.\n\npico_punks is all about exploring themes of irreversibility, noise, pattern recognition, pareidolia, and of course identity. What began for me as something bordering on satire, has become an integral part of how I represent myself online. It is my sincere wish that with these tools you are also able to create something unique that you feel represents you, and is something that couldn't have been made without you.\n\nThank you so much for these last couple years of support, and here's to many more making and collecting art together :)\n\n\nNotes on minting: \n- 30% of royalties go to the minter\n- 10% of royalties go to previous curated pico_punk holders\n- One reserve spot is generated for each curated pico_punk held, and they stack\n- One extra reserve spot is for my Mom",

            "description": "A relatively simple idea: columns filled with many thin horizontal lines, layered with complexity from colour features, stroke styles, and column perturbations. The compositions that emerge may be harmonious or asynchronous, comforting or jarring, wistful, mysterious, subtle, or bold.\n\nThe piece is generated as follows:\n\nFirst, borders and columns are defined. The canvas may have one or two borders, ranging from small to large, and the inner border may or may not have a coloured edge and fill. If they are not coloured, the feature \"Hidden Background\" will be true. Each column is assigned three colours at random from one of several possible colour palettes. The top and bottom boundaries of each column are set, and in some iterations, there is a chance that columns will break outside the border boundaries.\n\nAs columns are drawn from top to bottom, there are several events that may occur with probabilities pre-defined for each iteration: 1) The stroke colour may switch abruptly or over a gradient between two of the three column colours. 2) A 'repeater' pattern may be triggered, where two of the column colours alternate with a given frequency and rate of decay. 3) Single 'accent' bands may occur with the third column colour. 4) 'Bulges' may form with either rectangle, diamond, sin wave, or 'skirt' shapes.\n\nThere may also be horizontal bands that span the entire image, with a certain variability of height across columns.\n\nStrokes may be straight lines or Bezier curves. Bezier curves may be uniform for an iteration, where the control points of the curves are generated from a single formula for the whole image, or they may be random. Strokes may also have horizontal and/or vertical 'line fuzz', where the start and end points of the line are randomly offset in either direction.\n\nStraight strokes may or may not have a solid base-layer drawn underneath, which gives the image a more filled vs. sketched appearance. Top strokes may also be partially transparent, allowing for a layered effect.\n\nColumns are drawn in one of several possible orders, and once the initial drawing is complete, columns will be redrawn slowly and the image will evolve over time.\n\nPress '2', '4', '6', '8', or '0' to re-draw at 2K, 4K, 6K, 8K, or 10K resolution (shortest edge), which will also save an image when the initial draw is complete and before animation begins.\n\nPress 's' at any time to save an image at the current resolution.",

            "description": "land ‚Ä¢¬†generative audio ‚Ä¢ sky\n\nAudio: [a] to allow audio.\nInteract: [i] for more details, including URL parameters\n\nA meditation on the meeting point of sky and land, inspired by the salt marshes near my home, but with an other-worldly influence. I'm always keenly aware, perhaps as we all are, that humanity's hold on the planet is slipping. In time we may be forced to explore new avenues for survival, but then the dream of seeking a new world is nothing new. And then, pessimistic as it may be, perhaps one day we shall be forced to simply survey a desolate and scarred Earth, and admit that despite all they did, humanity got it wrong.\n\nThe piece takes place in a widescreen canvas, resolutely sticking to a monochrome rendition except in a vanishingly-rare coloured version, expected to appear in around 2.5% of pieces. Colour is interesting, of course, so there are extensive options for playing with various colour modes‚Äîdetails available on pressing 'I' in full-screen mode.\nHowever‚Ä¶  white on black, or black on white; the main piece relies on density, dot-size and texture for effect, whilst the aspect ratio not only suits modern computer screens, but allows for the expansive nature of the horizon to stretch forth.\n\nThe heart of the piece is the landscape itself, a small section of a very large circle. The OpenProcessing sketch ‚ÄòLandscape Curvature‚Äô documents my initial steps on the piece, a fumbling return to trigonometry.\n\nCurvature is thoroughly explored: a larger circle produces a nearly-horizontal line, with perpendicular features, whilst a smaller circle produces extremes of curvature, and divergingly-angled additions. Additionally, a negatively-large circle can be generated, inverting the horizon as though viewed through a fish-eye lens. Features sway towards each other, and cluster dangerously close in the centre of the piece.\n\nAlthough the piece is considered finished after three-hundred and sixty frames, I like the render process to be as much a point of interest as the finished piece, and so the landscape is formed progressively: thousand upon thousands of tiny points maniuplated and added to the piece over time.\n\nThis artwork renders fastest and most accurately in Google Chrome.",
