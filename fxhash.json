Este proyecto se aloja en la plataforma fx(hash) y genera obras de arte únicas utilizando un algoritmo y un sistema numérico hexadecimal que se crea con cada nuevo token.\n\nEste proyecto fue desarrollado utilizando la librería p5.js de JavaScript, creada por Lauren Lee McCarthy. Reflejos es el resultado de la interacción entre la percepción humana y un conjunto de reglas interpretadas por la máquina.\n\nInspirado por la experiencia de caminar junto al mar y los estados de calma y contemplación que esta actividad puede evocar, Reflejos busca entrelazar a los espectadores con las obras de la colección. \n\nLa intención es motivar al espectador a explorar su interior y descubrir momentos de apertura perceptiva. \n\nEl objetivo es que la obra provoque una sensación de calma y claridad en el espectador a través de una conexión íntima y personal.",

            "description": "This project is my first one in a series of algorithmic studies. Inspired by the work of Casey Reas and his \"Process Compendium\", it starts with a very simple text description of an algorithmic process. In this case, I came up this description:\n\n\"Place N circles randomly on the canvas. Select a point on each of the circles, and rotate it around its circle. At each step, draw a random line that connects all the points\"\n\nEach step is drawn with very low opacity, and is repeated a large number of times (these pieces draw around 6 million lines). Eventually, complex structures, shapes and patterns appear, that were impossible to predict from the text description alone: this is an emergent system.\n\nThe text description voluntarily leaves things open to interpretation: how many points ? which colors to use ? which rules for the drawing opacity and line weight ?

            "description": "This project is my first one in a series of algorithmic studies. Inspired by the work of Casey Reas and his \"Process Compendium\", it starts with a very simple text description of an algorithmic process. In this case, I came up this description:\n\n\"Place N circles randomly on the canvas. Select a point on each of the circles, and rotate it around its circle. At each step, draw a random line that connects all the points\"\n\nEach step is drawn with very low opacity, and is repeated a large number of times (these pieces draw around 6 million lines). Eventually, complex structures, shapes and patterns appear, that were impossible to predict from the text description alone: this is an emergent system.\n\nThe text description voluntarily leaves things open to interpretation: how many points ? which colors to use ? which rules for the drawing opacity and line weight ? Do all points move at the same speed ? Can they accelerate ? Are the circles allowed to extend past the canvas boundaries ?\n\nThis makes the process capable of interesting variations, as well as reusable: another artist implementation of the same description would most likely give very different artworks.\n\nDespite the apparent simplicity of the description, this collection ended up being a real challenge. Drawing millions of lines with low opacity turned out to be impossible without a GPU. WebGL is required.\n\nThis token uses the regl.js library.

            "description": "RAUSCH is a series of generative artworks that explore imaginary digital architectures. \n\nThis series challenges traditional notions of architectural representation and raises important questions about the role of resolution in design. Just as the pixel resolution of an image affects its perceived quality, the resolution of an architectural space can affect its qualities and livability. By embracing digital variation through codes, this series explores the interplay between abstract and concrete space through multiple resolutions. \n\nRAUSCH is inspired by the feeling of being overwhelmed by complex, chaotic and messy sensations, and aims to engage the viewer through a sense of wonder, disorientation, and awe.\n\nReleased on the occasion of Companions of Code, a group exhibition by VerticalCrypto Art at The NFT Gallery in London. \nCurated by Micol Ap.

            "description": "Seekers is inspired by the view that is held by mathematical realism, that mathematical entities objectively exist independently of the human mind. Therefore, mathematical entities are not constructed by humans, but rather, are discovered by humans. This means, that also other intelligent beings would be able to discover the same entities.\n\nIn 'seekers', a set of complicated, computer-generated functions are used to render coloured spaces on a Cartesian plane. The mathematical space is being explored and discovered by a group of seekers, which hover and fly around within the layers of infinitely evolving shapes. The vicinity of a seeker also modifies the surrounding mathematical space, which means that the seekers will never reach the objective reality.\n\nThe generating functions are created using human-curated evolutionary algorithm following the idea demonstrated already in Karl Sims' paper 'Artificial Evolution for Computer Graphics' in 1991.\n\n———\n\nFeatures 29 generative base functions, 15 palettes in various modes. Some palettes have a special 'dark mode', where the seekers also slightly illuminate the otherwise darkened space.\n\n----\n\nNotes for viewer:\n\n- The piece adapts to all screen sizes, although a fixed size can be defined by url parameters.\n\n- The piece is preferably viewed full-screen. The resolution can be adjusted for best performance.\n\n- The piece can be paused and high-resolution stills can be exported for printing.\n\n- Video clips can be exported in webm format. For a high-resolution video, frames should be batch exported as PNG-sequence and rendered in a video editing software.\n\n----\n\nControls: \n\n- Number keys from [1] to [8] adjust the resolution\n- [space] pauses animation\n- [s] exports a PNG with the current resolution\n- [x] starts and stops recording of a webm clip (25mbps)\n- [i] toggles display of frame number and resolution\n\n----\n\nURL parameters:\n\n- &width={WIDTH}&height={HEIGHT} explicitly sets the render resolution to {WIDTH}x{HEIGHT}. Resolution controls do not work when dimensions are explicitly set.\n\n- &rec={start},{end} batch records frames starting from {start} and ending at {end}. Can also be used to record stills. For example, if you want a still export from frame 300 in resolution 5000x3000, you can start the piece with url parameters &width=5000&height=3000&rec=300,300\n\n----\n\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND 4.0\n\nUtilizes fxHash template by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/tpl-umbrella-fxhash\nMIT License\n\nUtilizes components from thi.ng umbrella by Karsten Schmidt\nhttps://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella\nApache Software License 2.0",

            "description": "Our realities appear as a layering of moments, emotions, and choices that accumulate through space and time. These experiences pile up to form the foundation for everything to come, shaping our perspectives and influencing our sense of self, character, and worldview.\n\n'Pile' embraces the infinite possibilities of generative art to represent the rich, complex, and cumulative nature of life's experiences through the passage of time. Each moment builds on top of previous memories, where the present is always the sharpest, yet is soon obscured by what follows. Just as the imprint of past experiences can linger in our lives, the influences of older layers can still be seen in each piece, imbuing each composition with a depth and variety that is indicative of life's many histories. Composed of these textured and stacked layers, ‘Pile’ forms a dense and organic heap that embodies the controlled chaos of life's multitudes.\n\nResponses to our experiences tend to oscillate between thoughtfully pragmatic and mechanical means – and more sensitive, organic, and even passionate approaches. They’re a blur of exactitude and wildness, entropy and growth, a range of experiences and outcomes that vary so greatly that only by changing our perspectives and taking a step back can we see the commonality between each of our piles of life’s moments. The result is a visual representation of the cumulative nature of life's experiences, where forgotten moments and cherished memories are piled high with abandon, yet worthy of celebration.\n\nInspired by the works of artists such as Jackson Pollock and Joan Mitchell, 'Pile' invites us to contemplate the rich and multifaceted nature of life, and to celebrate the distinctive stories that each of us carries within. Through its vivid abstraction of life's controlled chaos, and the tension between organic lines and overtly digital marks, 'pile' beckons us to consider the intricacies of our own layered identities and to revel in the diversity of life.\n\ncreated in p5.js.\n\n_________________________\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press ‘p’ to save png\n- Press ‘1’ - ‘9’ to run a high resolution file (higher resolution files will take longer to load)\n",

            "description": "Our realities appear as a layering of moments, emotions, and choices that accumulate through space and time. These experiences pile up to form the foundation for everything to come, shaping our perspectives and influencing our sense of self, character, and worldview.\n\n'Pile' embraces the infinite possibilities of generative art to represent the rich, complex, and cumulative nature of life's experiences through the passage of time. Each moment builds on top of previous memories, where the present is always the sharpest, yet is soon obscured by what follows. Just as the imprint of past experiences can linger in our lives, the influences of older layers can still be seen in each piece, imbuing each composition with a depth and variety that is indicative of life's many histories. Composed of these textured and stacked layers, ‘Pile’ forms a dense and organic heap that embodies the controlled chaos of life's multitudes.\n\nResponses to our experiences tend to oscillate between thoughtfully pragmatic and mechanical means – and more sensitive, organic, and even passionate approaches. They’re a blur of exactitude and wildness, entropy and growth, a range of experiences and outcomes that vary so greatly that only by changing our perspectives and taking a step back can we see the commonality between each of our piles of life’s moments. The result is a visual representation of the cumulative nature of life's experiences, where forgotten moments and cherished memories are piled high with abandon, yet worthy of celebration.\n\nInspired by the works of artists such as Jackson Pollock and Joan Mitchell, 'Pile' invites us to contemplate the rich and multifaceted nature of life, and to celebrate the distinctive stories that each of us carries within. Through its vivid abstraction of life's controlled chaos, and the tension between organic lines and overtly digital marks, 'pile' beckons us to consider the intricacies of our own layered identities and to revel in the diversity of life.\n\ncreated in p5.js.\n\n_________________________\n\nControls (in live view):\n\n- Press ‘p’ to save png\n- Press ‘1’ - ‘9’ to run a high resolution file (higher resolution files will take longer to load)\n",

            "description": "\"Brutal Nature” explores the complex relationship between human consumption, its impact on the environment and the resilience of nature.\n\nThis project features a series of images that overlay brutalist buildings with lush landscapes that appear to be reclaiming the buildings. The abandoned buildings represent the remnants of a system built on exploitation and unsustainable growth, while the vibrant landscapes offer a vision of a future in which nature has reclaimed the spaces once occupied by industry and commerce. As nature slowly reclaims the once-imposing edifices, the artworks become a metaphor for the resilience of the natural world in the face of human destruction.\n\nThe resulting images are surreal and thought-provoking, evoking both a sense of awe at the power of nature and a recognition of the destructive impact of human activity. “Brutal Nature\" challenges us to reconsider our relationship with the environment and to imagine new ways of living in harmony with the natural world. The project encourages us to reflect on the choices we make as consumers, and to consider the impact of our actions on the planet and future generations.\n\nThis project uses a combination of WebGL effects and image compositing to create completely unique outputs. In total there are 25 high resolution images used with over 10 different types of effects possible. Random elements are also introduced to further individualize each iteration. High definition 8K images can be saved by adding \"?hd=1\" to the url.\n\nCollaborative project by @KilledByAPixel and @DehiscenceArt.\n\nThis token is part of the SESSIONS SERIES co-curated by the NFT Museum of Newberry, SC and Fort Gallery NFT.",

            "description": "Bauhausstadt (Bauhaus City) is a series that draws direct inspiration from Ludwig Karl Hilberseimer's (September 14, 1885 – May 6, 1967) work on city planning through a Bauhaus lens. Specifically, the series references his illustration from Bauhaus Magazine (Number 2, 1929) depicting a sustainable relationship between humans, industry, and nature. Hilberseimer proposed that this can be achieved through the construction of human habitation that ensures security for all people against disasters and crises.\n\nThis series explores Hilberseimer's use of \"protective\" architecture and repetition in his work, raising questions about the aesthetic and functional value of such an approach in urban planning. Through over 200 hand-drawn/coloured illustrations and a touch of randomness, the project visually poses this question and leaves it up to the viewer to decide its worth.",
