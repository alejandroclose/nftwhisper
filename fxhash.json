This time using MEK.txt’s landscape pixelart series and its distinctive dithering textures, brilliantly translated into code by IceRain to pixel-perfect iterations.\n\nDithered Nostalgia is a step up from MEK.txt & IceRain’s first project (Bento Boxes), trying to make more sophisticated, more detailed and challenging things based on something they passionate about; landscape.\n\nControls:\n[1] Set the resolution to Medium Resolution\n[2] Set the resolution to High Resolution",

We belong to a crowd who loves stories, of civilisations at stake and deities, of afterlife and worship. We drank and hugged and chanted pagan hymns. We minted the Bugged Forest from our place on earth that we call Hell just for the fun of it. We are passionate, and loving, and angry and desperate. We, people of the soil, under a bugged sun.\n-\nThis project is the long-form version of an algorithm that contains a bug. “The Bugged Tree”’s code was salvaged and stored and served as the core motivation and engine for an entire forest. Its concept is about releasing the control. I am a  byproduct of evolution, an iteration of that specie who wanted utter control, and which at some point, lost control over its own creation. As a generative artist, I chose to welcome the event of chance into my creative process. The symbolism in chance made me feel humble and free. Unwilling to make any change to a story that the Tree needed to tell me, as a listener, rather than a writer of my own idealised fantasies.\n-\nThe iterations aren’t under control. They may be odd and off. We have to accept it. They are also plottable, press [s] in live mode to get a SVG. Attempt the plot at your own risk, as there’s a possibility for it to come near to impossibilities or cause paper or motor damage, and most certainly, a bugged drawing.\n-\nFrom Earth or from Hell, with love, yours truthfully, NFTBiker and zancan\n",

            "description": "What Is Brutalism?\nBrutalism is a style of architecture that lasted from the 1950s-1970s, and it was characterized by simple, block-like, hulking concrete structures, with an emphasis on materials, textures and construction, producing highly expressive forms.\n\nThe buildings are characterised by their massive, monolithic and ‘blocky’ appearance with a rigid geometric style and large-scale use of poured concrete.\n\nBrutalism began to fade out in the 1980s, where it increasingly came to be regarded as cold, alienating and unfit for humans. It turned out that concrete had an allure of indestructibility but deteriorated from the inside, making it difficult to maintain and prone to crumbling and water damage as it aged.\n\nIn the years since, the world has been divided into those who think that Brutalist buildings are eyesores that should be demolished and those who find these vintage but not yet historic buildings architectural masterpieces to be cherished and preserved. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the work:\nThis work was built entirely with code using only math, logic and 2D shapes to create light, shadow and perspective.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nFeatures:\n\"Canvas Orientation\": Square, Portrait\n\"Building Size\": Large, Medium, Small\n\"Time of day\": Day, Night\n\"Sun/Moon\": True, False\n\"Palette\": 23 palettes\n\"Floors\": 3, 4\n\"Clouds\": True, False\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nConstrols in live mode:\nOn desktop: Press 's' or 'S' to save as PNG (2622x3720 or 3720x3720)\nOn mobile: Touch the screen to save as PNG (2622x3720 or 3720x3720)\n\nArtwork created with p5.js and love.\nNovember-December 2022",

            "description": "Tema is the second in a set of collections based on a month-long study of Edward Zajec, one of the early pioneers of generative art in the 1970s.\n\nAfter gaining some traction with his original collection RAM, Zajec and his collaborating programmer Matjaz Hmeljak undertook a more complex algorithm titled \"The Cube: Theme and Variation\" (or TVC). The program laid out 8 unique elements in a grid, creating a three-dimensional viewing of objects in space. They published a paper about the underlying algorithm, found at: http://www.edwardzajec.com/tvc4/pil1/index.html\n\nTVC was first printed in 1971, shortly after Zajec returned to Italy following his artistic studies in the US. It was programmed on an IBM 9044 & printed with a CalComp 563 plotter.\n\nControls (in live view):\n- Press [s] to save a high-resolution version of the image\n\nMade in p5js\nCreated January 2023\nBy @christine_hall",

            "description": "The slow moving shapes of ‘Everything’ explore how intricate compositions of space yield to the simple and fluid passage of time. Our human desire, and subsequent failure, to control the infinite expanse of time is our paradoxical reminder that we’re never actually Done - a delightful reality for those willing to focus on observing the unfolding present. This perpetual motion of time can also help us witness the underlying sameness of all things – that absence is form, artificial is reality, chemical is organic, and that the wildly natural is precisely mathematical. Where each piece is part of another piece, everything is everything.\n\nEven something as singular and technical as a pixel, is actually just the assembly of organic matter by humans into something that’s made to reflect the reality we want to see and share. Is the glowing movement of our screens actually so foreign to the analog mechanics of yesteryear and the hand-made crafts of our ancestors – or is it simply another mode of transcending the energies that come to us in an infinite faucet, flowing with beautiful intuitions and knowings for us to create with?\n\nSo let’s flow between colors and dimensional layers, vibes and astral planes, and the idiosyncrasies of endlessly undulating shapes that feel chemical and technical – microscopic, of the earth, and of the cosmos – an amalgam of matter evolving throughout unfolding time and the overlapping infinite.\n\n------\n\nIntended to be viewed as an animated piece, please tap the play button if you are seeing a cached static image.\n\nCommands in live mode:\n\nP : Play/Pause\nS : Save PNG (3000x3600)\nF : Enter Fullscreen\nSpacebar : Scene Change\n\nURL Parameters:\n\nBy default, fullscreen mode will render with a pixel density of 3. This requires a pretty modern gpu for smooth animation. If you are having problems you can lower the density by adding this to the url (without the quotes): “&fullscreen=2”\n\nWhen not in fullscreen mode, you can also specify a width for the image, in case you want to print something at a higher resolution. Because this is using shaders, the current maximum is around 5000 px, even though you can specify higher numbers. If browsers/GPUs support higher resolutions in the future, then this may change. To set the width, append this to the url: “&width=5000”\n\nNote: To view fullscreen on FireFox, please use the url param and not the “F” command for best results. ",

            "description": "This generator is named 'Ichigo' (苺/ いちご), the Japanese word for 'strawberry'. \n\nSeeing each iteration from a suitable distance, small dots (to me, reminiscent of strawberry seeds) overlay different sequences of geometric repetitions, implying a sense of texture, grittiness and irregularity. \n\nBy looking closer however, it becomes apparent to the viewer that the majority of the composition is in fact government by orderly elements, in this case grids of dots. \n\nThis discovery invites the viewer to consider the output in front of them at different levels, near and far. At what point do you feel the dots begin to dissolve into a texture? When do you stop noticing the dots and instead begin to perceive the overall composition?\n\nThese questions are posed in a similar fashion as with meditation; at what point does something become something else? When does an in-breath become an out-breath and vice versa? \n\nContemplation on simple questions like these can open a small portal into stillness and mindfulness by taking time to slowly observe our responses. \n\n23 palettes are included, each named after different areas of Tokyo. \n\nPress 'S' to download a full size 6000px x 6000px PNG output. \n\nAs always, much gratitude and enjoy your piece.

            "description": "\n\n\nDigitally crafted flowers in pots for virtual window sills.\n\nIn the spirit of the piranha plant from the Mario Bros videogame. We wanted to create a project that acknowledges the playful depiction of nature in early videogames by creating a retro futuristic collectible that explores aesthetics over gameplay, whilst preserving the playful energy of these early digital worlds. There are many game elements that have emerged over the years that have become iconic in their own right. Their memorable designs have come to represent the exciting feeling of when we first discovered these worlds, but over time an appreciation for their simple design execution, harmony and balance has emerged. Art can exist in many forms and places including a digital pot plant.\n\nRarity:\n\nThere are a total of 23 hand-drawn and animated sprites divided into 4 groups Firelillies, Flytraps, Quasars and Stargazers and there are 15 possible combinations made from these 4 groups. 18% of the collection is a combination of these 4 groups which we can call random and the remaining 72% is divided between the remaining 14 combinations.\n\n\nThere are 3 possible grid systems 1x1, 3x3 and 4x4 \n\n3% 1x1\n\n40% 3x3\n\n57% 4x4\n\n\n\nThere are 14 possible placement points for all grids and 76 stem/sprite arragement in total\n\n\n\nFor the pots and stems there are 11 colors to choose and  no rarities for color combinations.\n\n\n\nThe flower distribution can be either symmetric or random. 35% symmetric and 65% random\n\n\n\nExport options:\n\nPressing 's' on desktop or holding for 2 seconds will download gif to whatever the current device resolution is. To export at a different resolution open the token in new window by clicking 'open' link under the token image and add \"&exportsize=1080\" or \"&exportsize=2160\" to end of the url and hit enter then either hold for 2 seconds or press 's' to create gif and download.\n\n\n\n ",

(30% chance each)\n\nThe dominant stroke and fill colors are chosen at random from the RGB color space and are only recomputed if certain contrast criteria aren't fulfilled. \nIn combination with one of 10 hand-selected color palettes used for accents, this allows a great variation of different possible color schemes.\n\nThe structure and appearance of the bamboo, its stems and leaves are controlled by over 50 parameters that are chosen at random, giving each iteration a unique style.\n\n\n\nKeys: \nS - Save PNG image\nV - Open SVG Export menu\nSpace - Pause\n\nPlotting:\nYou can export a plottable SVG of each iteration by opening the export menu. I plot these on A3 with a 0.1mm fineliner. But depending on the density of the iteration other choices might be better suited. \n\n\nThe image is generated entirely in Javascript and the postprocessing is done with a custom shader. If there is no webgl support, the image will render without any postprocessing. You can force this by appending the URL parameter \"?noWebgl=1\".\n\nLibraries used:\nThree.js & EffectComposer\nJavascript-Voronoi by gorhill\nperlin.js by  Joseph Gentle\ndat.gui",

            "description": "This experimental artwork is a unique blend of human and machine inputs, showcasing the potential for collaboration between the two in the creative process. The human component of the piece is evident in the deliberate composition, choice of color, and the use of painting algorithms. Meanwhile, the machine component is represented by two powerful AI technologies. The first, ChatGPT3, generated a thought-provoking poem about the galaxies and cosmos, serving as the inspiration for the piece. The second, DALL-E 2, then used this poem as a prompt to create a stunning AI image, bringing the cosmic themes to life in a realistic and captivating way.\n\nThe combination of these two AI technologies, along with the human touch in the painting algorithms and composition, creates an artwork that is truly one-of-a-kind. The final product is not only visually stunning, but it also serves as a glimpse into the future of humanity and the possibilities of AI collaboration in art. The artwork is a testament to the beauty that can result from a seemingly discordant combination of human and machine inputs, and it invites us to consider the impact of technology on the creative process and the role of the human artist in the age of AI.\n\nArtist notes:\nPress s to download high-res images.\nPress a to see the AI-generated image.\nPress g to switch back to the paint.\n\nRead more on the medium website:\nshorturl.at/bkqW8",

            "description": "I recall living for quite some time in urban village areas, where they formed within a striking urban setting. Unlike suburban houses where spaces are ample and most housings are planned with careful consideration of other houses, these urban villages are limited by site and geographic boundaries. So it's almost inevitable that houses are built so close with each other, so much that no house has a backyard or front yard, everything was just roof and walls as far as the eye can see. Because these dwellings grow persistently according to the wants and needs of their dwellers, as the families within these walls grow, so does the urban village.\n\nIt's a chaotic scene for sure, but urban villages have their own candid beauty. Just by looking from the stacked facades of the walls that made up the houses, we can imagine the warm dynamic between the people and strong living impulses that spark from behind these walls.\n\n------------\n20 Color Palettes\nZoomed-in View\nVarious Window Shapes\n------------\nPress [s] to save captured image\n------------\n\n\nCreated using p5.js\nDirbots - Oct22",
