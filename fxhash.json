            "description": ">>> GAN ⫷glitch⫸ Ting Xu |  幹亭序 <<<\n\n• Generative glitch collage: More than simply a + b + c •\n\n\nAt the apex of Chinese calligraphy, Lantingji Xu, the preface, was written by the most renowned calligrapher in China, Wang Xizhi (王羲之).\n\nDuring the Spring Purification Ceremony, forty-two literati gathered along the banks of a coursing stream and engaged in a \"winding stream\" drinking contest: cups of wine were floated on the water upstream, and whenever a cup stopped in front of a guest, they had to compose a poem or otherwise drink the wine. At the end of the day, twenty-six literati composed thirty-seven poems in total and the Lantingji Xu, as a preface to the collection, was produced by Wang on the spot.\n\nIn the GTX collection, we create new intricate and expressive relationships between ink, paper, and pixels using Jimi's raw calligraphy work, their GAN offsprings, and Thomas's CHX-like glitch processing, generating unique calligraphy on mint and toasting at the same time.\n\n\nHow it works:\n\nCombining sets of raw layers that range from paintings, calligraphy, and GAN seeds, our algorithm applies an array of image processing magic, creating intricate novel outputs.\n\nWe have 102 raw layers separated into four groups. Each final output is formed by mixing and processing four randomly selected layers. \n\nGroup 1 contains textures, and it is composed of Jimi's paintings, GAN seeds from mixed custom models, and CLIP Guided Diffusions. \n\nGroup 2 contains Jimi's calligraphy work. \n\nGroup 3 contains GAN calligraphy seeds from custom models we trained on Jimi's body of work. \n\nGroup 4 contains digital grain textures.\nOur algorithm starts by selecting one layer from each group, assigning them sizes, opacities, orientations, and other parameters. Then it sets a dithering combination to be applied. We have eight combos formed by combining seven different custom dithering algorithms (3 at a time). \n\nAfter each dither gets applied to its corresponding layer, images get mixed using different blend modes to help combine them in fun ways. Afterwards, a couple more filters get applied to glue everything together. When all is said and done, final artworks get rendered onto the canvas.\n\nSit back, open the live view, and enjoy. \n\n\nAppreciate the art, not the speculation. Pay what you can. \n\nWith love, sweat, and tears –drops– \nJimi and Thomas.\n\n\nJimi's notes:\n\nI provided the calligraphy representing the extreme spectrum of my expression in brushwork and poetry. I also evaluated the GAN calligraphy outputs, helping Thomas hone the models. During the training process I was horrified and in awe by both the stupidity and sometimes brilliance of the GANs.\n\nThrough the layering techniques developed by Thomas, I have also gained new insights into calligraphy, taking it beyond brush, ink and paper. The spectrum of expression in calligraphy gets freed from traditional constraints in GTX. Fx(hash) calligraphy has become brush, code and screen. \n\nThomas does not read Chinese, but I was happy to let him crop my scrolls into square layers in ways he saw fit with the project's aesthetic. To my surprise, I did not only agree with his visual choices but also noticed how the illiterate crops had many Freudian slips. That is, my poetry made sense fractally. I think this is no coincidence for calligraphers that write their poetry. Calligraphy is more than the sum of beautiful brushstrokes and also greater than the sum of pretty characters. Calligraphy is the composition of space and semantics. Only in turn does meaning takes its place in parts of calligraphy. \n\n\nControls:\n[s] save as PNG.\n\n\nPaint / Ink / Photography –> GANs / Diffusions –> p5.js –> Blockchain\n\n\nCopyright (©) 2022 Thomas Noya and Jimi Wen\nLicensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0\n\n◉_◉ ◉_◉",

            "description": "Vistas is an exploration in using layers to build an abstracted geometric landscape using a generative algorithm. But in a way that not only creates a digital image but also allows for the creation of an IRL physical artwork made from the 18 layers of laser cut wood. \n\nAll mints created in first day will receive a free physical woodcut valued at ~$250. Up to 10% of all other mints may randomly get a free physical as well. \n\nLearn more about physicals: https://alleditions.art/p/vistas\n\nThe canvas for each output may be one of three different orientations, a square, portrait, or landscape. The portrait and landscape orientations create physicals that are 7.5 x 11.5 inches and square orientations create 7.5 x 7.5 inch physicals. \n\nThe resulting output is carefully designed so that it can be exploded into discreet layers (Shift-E) and exported as an SVG (Shift-S) so it can be used to laser cut or plot an IRL physical artwork. \n\nA variety of elements are used to construct each unique one of a kind landscape. Sun, moon, sunbeams, stars, clouds, mountains, hills, plains, beaches, fields, water, boats, rocks, trees, and even mysterious obelisks. \n\n\n\nUTILITY\n\nShift - P to export a PNG\nShift - E explode the layers\nShift - S export a vector SVG\n\nSlide the layers with the arrow keys. Click and drag the mouse to move the light source and adjust the layer shadows.\n\nQUERY STRINGS\n\nAdd &screws=true to render with screw holes for cutting in order to assemble a physical with chicago screws.\n\nAdjust the size of the output by adding &x=1150 and/or &y=1150 to adjust the physical size of the output where 100 = 1 inch.",

            "description": "Vistas is an exploration in using layers to build an abstracted geometric landscape using a generative algorithm. But in a way that not only creates a digital image but also allows for the creation of an IRL physical artwork made from the 18 layers of laser cut wood. \n\nAll mints created in first day will receive a free physical woodcut valued at ~$250. Up to 10% of all other mints may randomly get a free physical as well. \n\nLearn more about physicals: https://alleditions.art/p/vistas\n\nThe canvas for each output may be one of three different orientations, a square, portrait, or landscape. The portrait and landscape orientations create physicals that are 7.5 x 11.5 inches and square orientations create 7.5 x 7.5 inch physicals. \n\nThe resulting output is carefully designed so that it can be exploded into discreet layers (Shift-E) and exported as an SVG (Shift-S) so it can be used to laser cut or plot an IRL physical artwork. \n\nA variety of elements are used to construct each unique one of a kind landscape. Sun, moon, sunbeams, stars, clouds, mountains, hills, plains, beaches, fields, water, boats, rocks, trees, and even mysterious obelisks. \n\n\n\nUTILITY\n\nShift - P to export a PNG\nShift - E explode the layers\nShift - S export a vector SVG\n\nSlide the layers with the arrow keys. Click and drag the mouse to move the light source and adjust the layer shadows.\n\nQUERY STRINGS\n\nAdd &screws=true to render with screw holes for cutting in order to assemble a physical with chicago screws.\n\nAdjust the size of the output by adding &x=1150 and/or &y=1150 to adjust the physical size of the output where 100 = 1 inch.",
