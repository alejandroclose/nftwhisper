Its perspective effect, its perfectly imprecise lines, its subtle textures and its very advanced level of detail give it the appearance of a hand-drawn work.\n\nBehind the visible art (the image) hides another form of art, an extremely complex algorithm capable of calculating and drawing in 2D each variation of the Dencity project. To draw a variation, the algorithm notably takes around 3,000,000 to 20,000,000 random decisions based on the hash of the mint and draws around 800,000 to 4,000,000 lines to create all the strokes and texture effects.\n\nMade with ❤️, code and p5js.",

At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions.

Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible.

So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js.

I created a very large and affordable edition with the hope that collectors can freely explore the emergent potential of the algorithm. \n\nThe Burn (Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022, 12:05AM UTC):\n96 hours after minting opens, all unminted tokens will be burned.\n\np -> screen capture\n\n\nBackground:\nI thought it might be helpful to offer a little background as to why I'm so excited about 'Prismatic Thickets'. \n\nI began my professional life as a painter; both my degrees are in painting (MFA '92, BFA '89). I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

I got into computing immediately upon completing my MFA. At first, the digital work was to pay the bills (early digital design/illustration/production work.) Soon though, I grew pretty obsessed and started reading computing/software manuals cover-to-cover (yes, dork). At the same time, I was painting, primarily landscapes (plein air).\n\nThe plein air painting transitioned from landscapes, to trees, to just branches/leaves, which eventually led to abstract work based primarily on related natural patterns. I also began coding at this time (1994-95). One of my first creative programming projects was based on one of my painted patterned abstractions. I remember the first time I ran my program, saw the coded painting emerge and knew my life would never be the same. This led to an even deeper dive reading programming/math/CS theory textbooks (even bigger dork). \n\nI quickly realized there were very few programming references for people like me. This eventually led to me writing 3 Processing books and building numerous university creative coding programs around the country. Though this period was exciting, there still remained a major disconnect for me. I hadn't really put my painting background together with my coding background. Obviously, we didn't have marketplaces like fx(hash) back then, to support generative artists. So I essentially took refuge in the ivory tower, creating a gazillion demos, courses, tutorials, workshops, etc.\n\nThe worldwide interest in NFT's, especially in the generative space with Art Blocks and fx(hash) has created a venue for creative coders I honestly never thought was possible. It's completely rejuvenated my passion for creative coding and helped me reconnect with some creative coding OG's and many wonderful new artists. So many of the projects I see on Art Blocks and fx(hash) bring me back to the early days and passionate excitement of discovering the generative power of creative coding.\n\nMost of my NFT projects have been fairly dense physics-based experiments. Many of these leverage a codebase I've developed over decades, which I've been slowly porting from Java/P3, C++/OF to TypeScript/three.js. What I hadn't (re)explored was what got me excited about creative coding to begin with: generative painting.\n\n\nMade with: TypeScript, three.js, PByte.js, Node\n\nIn memory of Robert Slutzky",

            "description": "An important element of generative art is emergence. The most famous algorithm for this is probably Cellular Automata (CA).\n\nHowever, numerous generative artists have created works using CA, which has lost its visual freshness and is like chewing gum that has lost its taste.\n\nAlthough it is such a classic algorithm, adding my own little ideas to it and finding a new \"flavor\" is the reason why I code.\n\nHere, the subject is 1D Elementary Cellular Automata, the simplest of all cellular automata. 1D Elementary Cellular Automata has 256 different rules, which change the shapes produced. This work aims to create more complex shapes by randomly selecting some of those rules and placing multiple of them on the screen.\n\nThe on/off of the CA cell is often likened to the behavior of living creatures.As of 2022, in the country where I live, prices are rising, wages are not increasing, and COVID-19 has not yet ended. I created this work with the image of people at the mercy of these various rules.\n\n---\n\nScreen click: Change rules\nS key: Save png\nL key: Show/hide grid",
