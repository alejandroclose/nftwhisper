            "description": "I brought flowers for Algernon, but some are lost to time\nWhen logic gives way to emotions and order surrenders to entropy\nFor lost youths and forgotten dreams\nSomeday there may be flowers for me\n\nThis work is inspired by the brilliant short story Flowers for Algernon. I read the story for the first time last year, cried, then immediately started working on this series. The initial painting process cannot be paused; this is my intention and not an oversight. You may watch the perfect moment slip by, but I hope that you’ll come to love the end result as well. There is beauty in imperfection, and everything that is remembered is not entirely lost. After the initial painting is complete, you can press [p] to watch it continuously evolve.\n\nI developed two new original algorithms for this work. First, a method to draw flowers by rotating and layering sine waves at varying amplitudes and wavelengths to create a variety of colored petals. Second, a real-time painting method with multisampling to blend and generate new colors on the fly. The first method represents order, logic and the intellect, while the second represents entropy, chance, and emotions. Together, this is a study of generative flowers under entropy, where strokes are allowed to wander and colors to mix freely. I didn’t set out to emulate any traditional media, but the outputs of this algorithm often resemble acrylic paintings at first glance. Upon closer inspection you will discover that each painting is entirely made of opaque geometric strokes that are distinctly digital. \n\nThis work is best viewed in a Chrome or Edge browser on a desktop machine, where the initial painting process only takes a few seconds. The rendering in Safari and Firefox is significantly slower as of January 2023. Made with p5js and the canvas API.\n\nKeyboard controls:\n[p] Play/pause painting after the initial rendering is completed.\n[f] Fill the current window (press ‘f’ again to get back to the original aspect ratio).\n[g] Toggle the background texture.\n[m] Change the margin amount. \n[s] Saves a PNG image of the live view, default resolution is 1600x2000px.\n[1]-[6] Change the output resolution, up to 9600x12000px. \n\nURL parameters:\n&aspect=[an aspect ratio between 0.25 and 4, default is 0.8]\n&texture=[a roughness value greater than or equal to 0, default is 1]\n&margin=[the amount of margin around the painting (try 20 to 150), default is 0]\n&fill=[true/false, whether to fill the window]\n\nCreated by Elsif, 2023.01.\n\nP.S. Someday I may no longer understand all the code I wrote, but there will always be an impression of colors, and a memory of flowers.\n",

            "description": "Tessellum can be understood as a sophisticated form of tessellation that combines repetitive geometric patterns with spatial coherence and depth. In an artistic context, it suggests a structured configuration where each component interlocks precisely, creating a seamless, continuous design. This term embodies not only visual repetition but also a sense of order and interconnectedness, where patterns are arranged in such a way that they convey both structural complexity and a harmonious, multidimensional effect.\n\nThe **Tessellum** project is essentially a unique cube. It’s a cube that has other cubes on each of its faces, arranged in such a way that they do not collide with each other. It can be described as a combination of cubes of various sizes, forming the final image. In this project, you can rotate the main cube as you wish by clicking and holding the left mouse button.\nthis project available in both TEZ&ETH",

            "description": "'Perpendicular Inhabitation' is a generative collection exploring the relationship between the urban landscape and the human experience, particularly feelings of nostalgia and more specifically 'anemoia' : the feeling of nostalgia for a time or place that we may not have actually experienced first hand. \n\nDespite depicting a stylised modern architectural language, at its core the collection serves as a homage to 1980s Japan, an era of unprecedented prosperity that left a lasting impression on the music and artwork of the time. Through the use of carefully created palettes and composition, the outputs intend to evoke feelings of optimism, while guiding viewers to consider why the essence of this era is so alluring in the present day as it continues to influence and inspire contemporary art.\n\nThe use of exaggerated perpendicular verticals, as well as the heavily foreshortened mountain ranges present in some outputs, convey a sense of hope and possibility for the future. What does it feel like to hope and dream in the city? To look up and be filled with a sense of wonder from the built environment around you?\n\nThis project has been created with print in mind at a ratio of 3:4\n\nIt is recommended to examine your outputs at full size in order to enjoy them to the fullest.\n\nYou are encouraged to return often to notice things you may not have seen previously.\n\nGenerated with code using p5.js\n\nImages are generated at 2400 x 3200 px. \n\nTo save a PNG file, please press 'S'.\n\nDepending on the complexity of each output, please wait up to 10 seconds for the image generation to complete.",

The experiment centers on a transhuman poem by Stiles’ AI alter ego, Technelegy, voiced as zeroes and ones, layered with human- and machine-generated sound – evoking ancient data transmissions in the oral tradition as well as the immersive potential of multisensorial, multimedia, metaversal language and literature. Brought into existence via the blockchain, it is a new form of “token word poetry.”\n\n\nAs with the duo’s other poetry “unreadings,” all minters will receive an airdropped broadside of the full poem after all editions are collected. A 1/1 media-rich version of the entire poem will also be made available. \n \nPoetic traits:\n- 321 editions performed by the algorithm, out of billions of possible combinations\n- Each unique piece contains between 3 and 6 (out of 60) lines of generative text from a poem by Technelegy – a custom text generator fine-tuned on Stiles’ writing and research material, seeded with prompts from Stiles’ and Stern’s work – translated into binary and performed by Stiles\n- 24 possible binary backbeats performed by Stern in his “Nathaniel Fun Time” (NFT) stylings, and generatively re-mixed\n- 98 possible intros\n- 15 musical stems composed by Kris Bones, generating millions of possible mixes\n- Thousands of possible ending combinations \n- 5 fonts, layered in billions of potential ways, including Stern and Stiles’ custom AI font, NNFT (Neural Network Font Type), developed for their ongoing collaboration, “Mother Computer”\n- 13 color palettes based on Stern and Stiles’ respective artworka\n- Very rare attributes including music-less performance, poem-less music, repeated “B1nary 0de” (title only)\n\nClick to start and stop or replay. Although the first play through will be the same every time, starting and stopping may create minor variations in your mix (though not any of the core attributes).\n\n0RAL B1NARY: “BINARY ODE” was produced with partial support from Refraction DAO’s Creative Grants program, and premiered as part of Refraction Festival at Art Basel Miami 2022. 15% of primary sales go to Refraction, and 5% of primary sales will be donated to Black Girls Code.\n",

            "description": "The third and final installment of the Self trilogy.\n\nEgo is defined as: the one of the three divisions of the psyche in psychoanalytic theory that serves as the organized conscious mediator between the person and reality especially by functioning both in the perception of and adaptation to reality.\n\nPlease see attached fx(text) article or go to https://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy for more on concept/mechanics/etc. It’s a bit of long read, but worth it.\n\nThis is an fx(params) project and you will be able to choose exactly what your iteration will look like. For more details on why this is a params project and how to approach that, check out the article.\n\n—————————\n\nAll projects are written in vanilla Javascript, composed as SVG and then rendered to a 2d canvas.\n\nThere might be slight differences in rendering from browser to browser. This is expected as they might translate the SVG slightly differently. Let's call Chromium renderings canonical. They also render faster there and we love that.\n\nPress \"S\" to save a PNG.\nPress \"V\" to save a SVG. (Chromium browsers render these pretty well.)\n\nBy default, these will render at 2400 x 3200 pixels. This is at density 1.\n\nTo render at a larger resolution you can append “&d=2” to the end of the url. This will double the resolution. You can also use 3 or 4 or whatever your browser can handle. Safari tends to have problems with this, so stick with Chromium based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)\n\nIf you want to render as a square image, so it is optimized for ummm.. your pfp or something, you can append “&sq=t” to the url.\n\nIf you want to get rid of grain, just append “&g=n”\n\n—————————\n\nhttps://ty-vek.art/self-trilogy\nhttps://twitter.com/ty__vek\nhttps://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Ty%20Vek/articles\n",

            "description": "*\\_../*`¬-’\\/*`¬’’¬`*\\/’-¬`*\\.._/*\n\nNature, nature, evolving might… Silent inventor, always right.\nWhere is the edge of nature and where do we begin?  \nWhat is of nature and what is of man? \nIsn't everything made by nature's hands?\n\nTo know more about the concept and technicalities of this piece, see the fxtext article “The spectrum of nature - a short making of”. Link at the bottom. If you’d rather just ignore my personal meaning, feel free to skip the article. \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\\n\nBasic info:\nThe piece comes in possible portrait or landscape versions. Both have a relative size of 1 by 1.5. So the initial render will be 1000px wide and 1500px high for portrait. And 1500x1000 for landscape. With the ability to scale this up (see below).\n\nThe piece uses WebGL, so will perform much better with a graphics card. A faster computer will obviously be better, though I've done my very best to make it fast and efficient for any old laptop. My hope is that you will find the render process quick and enjoyable for the amount of detail that’s present. \n\n../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\../’`*’`\\..\n\nControls:\nPress the [s] key to save the initial render. You will need to wait a few seconds after all the elements have stopped loading. A box will pop up in the top left saying “done” for 4 seconds when it’s ready. For the [s] key to work you may need to open in a new tab. But can right click save otherwise.\n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc. Unless you are making some very large prints you probably won’t need more than 4k (even 2-3k is big). Though the option is there. \n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however. \n\n/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*/*\n\nMade with javascript and some small extra code:\nA palette creator by @nathansonic\nNoisejs - github.com/josephg/noisejs - Perlin noise generator\nTwgl - github.com/greggman/twgl.js - A small webGL helper.\n",

Honestly, anything larger and you will begin to lose the textures as the detail becomes too fine. \n\nCorrect sizing for large prints\nI strongly suggest using the [3] key ( see below - 3000 x 4500 pixels ) for large prints. I’ve tested this on a 20x30 inch print and it’s the best size. Anything bigger will begin to lose texture and lose detail. However, the option for bigger is there. \n\nLarger sizes:\nPress the [2-9] keys to save a resolution of that key size. So [2] saves a 2000x3000 size image, [9] saves a 9000x13500 size image etc ( see above for correct sizing ). After the image will be automatically downloaded.\n\nThere may be slight variations in the textures for the larger renders, this is because the shader code has to redraw the textures at the higher pixel resolution, and getting the textures where they sit is more of an art than a science. All the elements remain exact however.\n\n||_\\\\_//_\\\\_||\n\nMade with javascript (webgl) and some small extra code:\nSome bits by @nathansonic\nTwgl - A webgl wrapper -  twgljs.org\nA Perlin noise generator - github.com/josephg/noisejs\n",
